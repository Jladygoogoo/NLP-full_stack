__label__KIRK Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?
__label__KIRK But our people have phaser number two. 
__label__KIRK Who? 
__label__KIRK But it needs to eat. Frequently. So it can't have any great power reserves. 
__label__KIRK Your campaign, Mister President.
__label__KIRK As witches. 
__label__KIRK Lights, please. Gentlemen, this is for the record of the Fuhrer's Final Solution speech. 
__label__KIRK What about the Constellation's tapes? 
__label__KIRK You filthy liar! 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power. The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship. 
__label__KIRK Ready, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Bones? (sees another skeleton chained to the wall) Doc? 
__label__KIRK But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees below zero. 
__label__KIRK I'll report your work here. I think the Federation will understand. 
__label__KIRK Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK What earns Spock your special interest? 
__label__KIRK Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call. What happened? 
__label__KIRK Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like a folk dance. 
__label__KIRK The last piece of sabotage. I know who you are. A thousand feet up, no method of reaching the Soul, except by air, by flight. Tchar. 
__label__KIRK We merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for.
__label__KIRK Specify. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam. Scan us. 
__label__KIRK Bones, the worst thing you can do to a practical joker is to play a practical joke on them. 
__label__KIRK All engines stop. 
__label__KIRK We? 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate. 
__label__KIRK I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not going to let him commit patricide. 
__label__KIRK But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way.
__label__KIRK Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest. He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship from your captain. A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny.
__label__KIRK Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that?
__label__KIRK Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus? 
__label__KIRK Why, thank you. Ambassador. 
__label__KIRK I fail to see the significant difference. 
__label__KIRK Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure.
__label__KIRK Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings? 
__label__KIRK Does the brain return to normal? 
__label__KIRK What do you read so far? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three.
__label__KIRK I know, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. Security two alert. Find and restrain Lieutenant Kevin Riley. He's armed and possibly headed towards the ship's theatre. 
__label__KIRK Johnson. Get down to Security. Search every section. Some Klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship. Then get down to Engineering and help Scotty hammer things back to normal.
__label__KIRK I'm on my way. Battle stations.
__label__KIRK By the way, Mister Sulu, any chance of teaching me that body throw? Could come in handy sometime. 
__label__KIRK I want him unconscious for a while. (Dehner sedates him) 
__label__KIRK Yeoman, record this for Starfleet Command. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK The what? 
__label__KIRK Is that the end of it? 
__label__KIRK Who are you? How did you come to be in our universe? 
__label__KIRK Er, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your dressmaker. 
__label__KIRK Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you? 
__label__KIRK Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source of radiation is not from our universe. 
__label__KIRK The name of this game.
__label__KIRK Kirk out. (returns to the magnetic tapes)
__label__KIRK Jackson! 
__label__KIRK Rayburn, maintain post here. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Sheriff. I want you to stop the fight. 
__label__KIRK That's assuming they got here three days ago. 
__label__KIRK I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help. 
__label__KIRK Stand back. 
__label__KIRK How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Help them. I don't care what it takes or costs. You've got to help them. 
__label__KIRK Report, sir. 
__label__KIRK Very good. 
__label__KIRK Later, Bones. (pushes one nearly as big as himself off his chair)
__label__KIRK Tie in. 
__label__KIRK Earth ship, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Reading, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Why are they so sure I can help them? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. 
__label__KIRK Yes. My ship. 
__label__KIRK Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship, and I need him. 
__label__KIRK You're half dead, all of you! You've been dead for centuries. We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now, and you can't stand that, can you? You're half crazy because there's nothing inside.
__label__KIRK I don't want a prediction. You will start work immediately, around the clock, nonstop, until you arrive at a formula that gets us out of here. 
__label__KIRK You don't have to do that. 
__label__KIRK This is the engineering section. There are a number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls. Over here are a number of control computers. 
__label__KIRK There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be sent?
__label__KIRK Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Enterprise. (The cloud reaches them) Now! Energise and detonate! 
__label__KIRK And yourself? 
__label__KIRK Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at their weakest point? 
__label__KIRK Initiate warp six. 
__label__KIRK Wait. If this is a trial, we have the right to know what you think we've done. 
__label__KIRK Excellent. Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert. Mister Chekov, resume original course, warp factor two. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK You're aboard the starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Was the word totally random, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK We don't want to hurt you. What is this place? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact. 
__label__KIRK You all right? 
__label__KIRK At least try cutting him off!
__label__KIRK You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles. 
__label__KIRK And next in line, Deneva. Bones, what's your theory about the cause of all this? 
__label__KIRK Standard orbit, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit. 
__label__KIRK (pointing to Sulu) Bones. Can effect changes in time, causing turbulent waves of space displacement. 
__label__KIRK Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked. Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power. 
__label__KIRK There is no third planet. 
__label__KIRK We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help.
__label__KIRK Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship.
__label__KIRK Here. The plan must be in there. Is it indexed? 
__label__KIRK The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from.
__label__KIRK I intend to get a lot closer. I'm going to ram her right down that thing's throat. 
__label__KIRK You're the doctor, Doctor. Can you explain this?
__label__KIRK Well, by all means, do so. 
__label__KIRK Engines at full speed. Get her out of orbit and into space. 
__label__KIRK Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant.
__label__KIRK Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment. 
__label__KIRK We'll delay departure for a time. I'm beaming back down to the planet. 
__label__KIRK Fact. You said you needed the crystals. Fact. An hour after you said you must have them, they were missing. Fact. Two of my crewmen were attacked. 
__label__KIRK Wilson, give me your phaser. 
__label__KIRK Get the transporter room ready. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast.
__label__KIRK Emergency reverse power. 
__label__KIRK Lay in. Computer? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and protect the number four shield. 
__label__KIRK The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us. 
__label__KIRK Straight ahead, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation system. See what effect that has. 
__label__KIRK Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in reverse thrust? 
__label__KIRK Excuse me. 
__label__KIRK They won't hurt you.
__label__KIRK Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian?
__label__KIRK Which is the laboratory door? 
__label__KIRK The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence. 
__label__KIRK Shuttlecraft? 
__label__KIRK Ask me anything. Anything. 
__label__KIRK That is correct. 
__label__KIRK He lied. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. Remember that.
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. 
__label__KIRK Perfectly all right. Where are you? 
__label__KIRK All things die. 
__label__KIRK I'm glad you weren't disappointed. 
__label__KIRK I need you, Spock, but we can't take any chances. We'll keep you confined for a while longer. If you can maintain control, we'll see. My nephew. If he regains consciousness, will he go through that? 
__label__KIRK Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh. 
__label__KIRK Exactly? 
__label__KIRK Space terminology. We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light. I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are. 
__label__KIRK Antimatter container positioned and armed.
__label__KIRK The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Getting into shape? 
__label__KIRK Norman, who created you? 
__label__KIRK Took the ship out of warp speed. 
__label__KIRK Superstition. 
__label__KIRK Hold our position out here, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, have Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, and Lieutenant Galloway report to the transporter room. We'll board and investigate.
__label__KIRK Half speed. Prepare for evasive action.
__label__KIRK He gambled, I won. 
__label__KIRK We've got to get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, push it right to the edge. This ship has got to manoeuver. 
__label__KIRK Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it? 
__label__KIRK Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder? 
__label__KIRK At the risk of sounding like a mystic, that depends on the stars.
__label__KIRK I have no intention of striking you dead. 
__label__KIRK Something tells me we've just been used as a diversionary tactic.
__label__KIRK Yes. That would answer a lot of questions. 
__label__KIRK Do we get out of here? 
__label__KIRK Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans in order to avoid human emotion? 
__label__KIRK Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial.
__label__KIRK On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe. 
__label__KIRK DO you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man to do that. 
__label__KIRK Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard. What do you think, Spock? 
__label__KIRK I place you in the hands of our chess master.  (Kirk gets up and leaves) 
__label__KIRK Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on two people. 
__label__KIRK Good, Bones, good. 
__label__KIRK Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock?
__label__KIRK I'll be guided by that opinion, Doctor, for the present. What about questioning them? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron  EVE: I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you. 
__label__KIRK Belay that order. I'll stay here. 
__label__KIRK You seem to be in command. 
__label__KIRK To say the least. 
__label__KIRK How much longer, McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock! 
__label__KIRK Try to override. Shut it off!
__label__KIRK Helen described  PIPER: She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.
__label__KIRK These are a proud people. They have their own customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them. It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law. Is that clear? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, vacate the computer room. 
__label__KIRK You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way.
__label__KIRK Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang? 
__label__KIRK Walking Bear. 
__label__KIRK Mess call. 
__label__KIRK Not what I wanted, Bones. What had to be. (McCoy hands him a communicator from his bag) Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the figures computed? 
__label__KIRK Is he important to you, more important than anything? Is he as though he were a part of you? 
__label__KIRK I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?
__label__KIRK Secure from Red Alert.
__label__KIRK There is a disease here, something that affected the Exeter landing party and us. 
__label__KIRK Let's hope the trial hasn't started. 
__label__KIRK No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus.
__label__KIRK I know, and I thank you. I have to go and change. You ready? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival. (all officers leave) 
__label__KIRK Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go.  (Charlie can't make Kirk lose his balance. He gets dumped instead.) 
__label__KIRK Sorry, Commander. Your ship is, er, impounded. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?
__label__KIRK You threw the first punch. 
__label__KIRK Up there. Outside, up there, everywhere. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Spock. (grabs the woman to use her as a shield, but she bites his hand.) At least tell me why you want to kill me. 
__label__KIRK Our child? 
__label__KIRK Yes, what is it? 
__label__KIRK The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer? 
__label__KIRK My crew is sworn to secrecy.
__label__KIRK Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out. 
__label__KIRK We need to coordinate this to our own universe. Can we do that, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Get ready to beam up. 
__label__KIRK By whose order? 
__label__KIRK Keep going. 
__label__KIRK Bridge to engineering. Begin full braking power. 
__label__KIRK If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly. 
__label__KIRK She's on board by now. Yes. She's on board. 
__label__KIRK I'm not. I'm interested in justice. 
__label__KIRK The headbands. Look at them. 
__label__KIRK Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room. 
__label__KIRK I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days  FINNEGAN: Hey, Jim baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!
__label__KIRK Where's does that sound coming from? Spock, can you pinpoint it? 
__label__KIRK (another chip) Mister Spock is with me here. He'll answer all questions. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever. 
__label__KIRK Relay it, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Can you explain what happened? 
__label__KIRK The others? 
__label__KIRK Damage Control, report.
__label__KIRK Transfer it to my quarters. 
__label__KIRK Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six. 
__label__KIRK We're here, Bones. And the theories about this place seem to be right. 
__label__KIRK Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge. 
__label__KIRK Once. I didn't have time to look around. 
__label__KIRK Even so, I would hardly call your city our natural environment. 
__label__KIRK This is General Trelane. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey.
__label__KIRK There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you.
__label__KIRK Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing.
__label__KIRK And very evasive. Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then,  LOKAI: I insist, I'm extremely tired. Made so by your vindictive cross-examinations. I will answer no more questions. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Commander Giotto. 
__label__KIRK Look. 
__label__KIRK And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade? 
__label__KIRK You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains. 
__label__KIRK Can you do it? 
__label__KIRK All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling us what you want without all the Olympian generalities? 
__label__KIRK And your reflexes. We're going to need fast reflexes from now on.
__label__KIRK And you haven't yet. Readings, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk. First of all, I must protest the killing of my crewman. 
__label__KIRK Not without my First Officer. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an investigation of this so that a proper report ADAMS [OC]: No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er, Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible.
__label__KIRK And you're on the edge of insubordination. 
__label__KIRK Casualties? 
__label__KIRK You have less than two hours, Councilman. 
__label__KIRK This is where they live. They digest rock, they tunnel for nourishment. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it. 
__label__KIRK Will she live? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment. 
__label__KIRK What's that, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK Bones! 
__label__KIRK Ah. 
__label__KIRK It may be able to navigate on land. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command. Advise them of our situation. Include all log entries to this point. 
__label__KIRK We can beam up, Tracey. All of us. 
__label__KIRK The main attack force. The war games. 
__label__KIRK He saw me off on this mission. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found the unit in there. It's in pretty good shape. I also found about a million of these silicon nodules. They're eggs, aren't they? 
__label__KIRK Actually, I'm losing an officer. 
__label__KIRK Throw the switch. 
__label__KIRK Read out, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK First, Bones, the ingredients you require. 
__label__KIRK As though he's keeping us here for some reason. 
__label__KIRK All right, it's difficult. What's your point? 
__label__KIRK You used a Vendorian, which, I might add, is also a violation of the treaty. 
__label__KIRK Lazarus, what happened? 
__label__KIRK It's now very clear you know each other extremely well, gentlemen. The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together. It is not a battlefield. 
__label__KIRK Here. Let me try it. 
__label__KIRK Activate shields. 
__label__KIRK Aurora, cut power. You are overtaxing your ship. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away. 
__label__KIRK That's enough, Charlie. 
__label__KIRK Our mission is to investigate. 
__label__KIRK Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?
__label__KIRK We know her future. Within six years from now, she'll become very important. Nationally famous. 
__label__KIRK That's enough, Spock. Mister Scott, take the conn. Spock. Mister Sulu, plot a course to take the Enterprise out of the Neutral Zone at warp eight. Lieutenant M'Ress, put the ship on Yellow Alert. 
__label__KIRK Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he can change. Maybe he wants to change his image. 
__label__KIRK But how? 
__label__KIRK I never met a rose that didn't. 
__label__KIRK Good. We want him to be a sterling witness. 
__label__KIRK Then we'll take him with us. 
__label__KIRK Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK Yes. (a mob approaches) My friends are coming back with reinforcements. 
__label__KIRK Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared just like that.
__label__KIRK With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can be taught not to use his power  THASIAN: We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it, always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves. 
__label__KIRK Jealousy has often been a motive for murder. 
__label__KIRK Spock, who are the Terratins? Where'd they come from? 
__label__KIRK Put it on audio. 
__label__KIRK Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser. 
__label__KIRK No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me alive. 
__label__KIRK Let's get him, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Do you have any ideas? 
__label__KIRK You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify immediately. 
__label__KIRK I almost married her! 
__label__KIRK Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship? 
__label__KIRK Yes, he is. 
__label__KIRK Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way. 
__label__KIRK Start making preparations, Mister Sandoval.
__label__KIRK Yeoman. (picks the pen up) You have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker? 
__label__KIRK You'll try to explain. You'd better be prepared to do more than that. Kirk out. Mister Spock, I'll need your help. Mister Chekov, maintain battle readiness. Lieutenant Uhura, see that the transporter room is standing by. 
__label__KIRK Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a nice, likable girl. I think we could become friends. It's possible. 
__label__KIRK Cut power. Keep those shields down.
__label__KIRK My duty is to stop you in any way I can. 
__label__KIRK What are you doing here, Bones? 
__label__KIRK I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe. Work out a setting. 
__label__KIRK A different centre of the brain, you say? 
__label__KIRK The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock. Care to join the landing party, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK What do you want? 
__label__KIRK By whom? 
__label__KIRK Send him down naked if you have to. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Boss? All right, Lieutenant, put him on. Oxmyx. This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets. 
__label__KIRK In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander? Give it to me. 
__label__KIRK No, no, everything is fine. 
__label__KIRK The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually. 
__label__KIRK Phaser crews stand ready.
__label__KIRK What do you mean, survival? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. 
__label__KIRK Let's get them while we are. Before we enter the Neutral Zone.
__label__KIRK We've got helm and navigational control. Turn us about. Have Mister Chekov plot a course back to the space station.
__label__KIRK John Gill was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. For him to be a Nazi is impossible. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott. Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others. One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient. Captain Kirk, out. Prepare to beam aboard.
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, bring us about to a new heading of nine oh two mark six. 
__label__KIRK But where? To what purpose? The number of ships indicates a mass migration. Or invasion. 
__label__KIRK All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say the woman drugged me. What is your sober, sensible solution to all this? 
__label__KIRK How did you manage to test it? 
__label__KIRK What's that? 
__label__KIRK (with echoy Sargon voice) The transference is complete. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Four to beam up, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill everyone? 
__label__KIRK I asked you first. 
__label__KIRK Where did you hear this order, Ensign? Now, listen to me. This order is false. I want you and your men to return to their stations. 
__label__KIRK Saurian brandy. 
__label__KIRK Read out. 
__label__KIRK What about radio communication? 
__label__KIRK Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself. 
__label__KIRK I don't need the ship for that. 
__label__KIRK Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the area of darkness to gain further information. 
__label__KIRK What was it he said, pain and delight? 
__label__KIRK Prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass. 
__label__KIRK But Spock will be dead. His body's dying this minute. 
__label__KIRK Good. I'll contact Kor right away. 
__label__KIRK Noted. You should know, however, that there's very little a Starbase can do that a starship can't. 
__label__KIRK And for humanity? You're still human  DEHNER: No, I  KIRK: At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me. 
__label__KIRK No change? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die. 
__label__KIRK If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button.
__label__KIRK Plum? 
__label__KIRK And there's this power surge, right off the scale. Like a door closing. It must be near here. 
__label__KIRK There's only one kind of woman. 
__label__KIRK It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life support systems. 
__label__KIRK Look at him. 
__label__KIRK It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we're to provide Starfleet with an accurate report. Lieutenant, send Doctor McCoy to the transporter room for survey party. We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet. Do you hear me? Kirk to entity. Kirk to entity. 
__label__KIRK We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship. 
__label__KIRK What was that? 
__label__KIRK You saw what it did to Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Not even if we're in danger, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Agreed. Judging from the disappearance of Alondra, the cloud lives on the energy it converts from the planets it consumes. 
__label__KIRK Guests? You don't know the meaning of the word. Guests aren't treated like common prisoners. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you're a stubborn man. 
__label__KIRK Spock, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order. Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes. We're evacuating all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Doctor. (drinks) That's one of your better prescriptions. 
__label__KIRK Who are they? Where are they from? 
__label__KIRK Well, thank you. It does something for you. 
__label__KIRK Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here. I think the Enterprise will do quite nicely. I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock. Maintain standard orbit, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Positive identification? 
__label__KIRK Fuel consumption report? 
__label__KIRK Now wait a minute. 
__label__KIRK Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mister Scott. Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in Engineering? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it. 
__label__KIRK You did what you could. 
__label__KIRK This is. 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Matt, where's your crew? 
__label__KIRK Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time. 
__label__KIRK Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely. Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage. 
__label__KIRK I know a murder's been committed. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry about your father. 
__label__KIRK We're under attack. Beam us aboard, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Either one could solve our problems right now. 
__label__KIRK Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship! 
__label__KIRK Yes, I can see that. Well Mister Spock, for the next five or six hours, we're going to have the happiest crew in space. Of course, we won't get much work done. 
__label__KIRK Ghost stories, ogres, demons. The whole  (Footsteps, then the dungeon door opens. Down the steps walk - Scott and Sulu! as if in a trance.) 
__label__KIRK Take care of him, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK I'm going back to the ship. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan.
__label__KIRK But your vessel was destroyed, too. Where was your consciousness kept? 
__label__KIRK Miramanee. Come here. Miramanee. 
__label__KIRK Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready? 
__label__KIRK Spock. Spock? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check. There may have been radiation from the explosion. 
__label__KIRK As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back.
__label__KIRK Bones. (starts to collapse.) No, no, I'm all right  (McCoy helps him onto a bed.) 
__label__KIRK Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late. 
__label__KIRK I understand. I understand, Natira. Ten thousand years ago, a sun was dying and with it, its world. It's the world you see on the plaque in the room of the Oracle. 
__label__KIRK Spock. What does Herbert mean? 
__label__KIRK Stand by to reverse course. 
__label__KIRK You don't know yet, do you? 
__label__KIRK A phaser! Come on! (arriving at the scene) Garrovick, did you? 
__label__KIRK Can do, sweetheart? 
__label__KIRK Are any conclusions possible from the information? 
__label__KIRK Nomad, there are two men waiting outside. You will not harm them.
__label__KIRK Me? 
__label__KIRK Engage, Mister Sulu. Quarter speed.
__label__KIRK How is he? 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, what are you doing here? 
__label__KIRK Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure. 
__label__KIRK No, yet there was something wrong. I can't pin it down. His conversation was disjointed, his thoughts a little foggy, unrelated.
__label__KIRK Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick! 
__label__KIRK What's the matter? Why can't he get through? 
__label__KIRK Orbit condition. 
__label__KIRK I've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them. 
__label__KIRK How long has it been? 
__label__KIRK I'll be right there. 
__label__KIRK Harmless, maybe. Little? (pushes a beach ball off his seat) In any case, they're eating the quintrotriticale. 
__label__KIRK We're not going anywhere. 
__label__KIRK What's next? They're not machines, Jim?
__label__KIRK I don't know. Any more like that and they'll tear this planet apart. 
__label__KIRK An island. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of, um, er, adolescence. 
__label__KIRK Lock onto it, Mister Kelso.
__label__KIRK Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them. 
__label__KIRK This psychokinetic power of yours, how long have you had it? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign. 
__label__KIRK Earth equivalent approximately 1485. 
__label__KIRK Come. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. Inform the ambassador and Doctor Jones we're ready to beam them aboard. Kirk out. Are you sure this visor will work? 
__label__KIRK And the three billion on Daran Five. 
__label__KIRK If you can't keep her, that's not my problem. 
__label__KIRK Are they aboard? Scotty, are they aboard? 
__label__KIRK Fully operable, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Bones, that's it. Stay with Chekov. Keep those people from feeding Vaal. Don't let them feed Vaal. Keep them in the hut. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Is that all it means to you? To report and die? 
__label__KIRK You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK That's pretty good. I got one for you. The rabbit was followed by a little blonde girl, right? 
__label__KIRK Ghosts, witches. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK No. A lover. Companion. It is wrong to keep us here against our will. 
__label__KIRK The result is suffocation. 
__label__KIRK I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo lift. Hurry. (Scott and Spock leave) Never lose you.
__label__KIRK No, you won't. You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to work. We'll help you for a while. Humans have survived under worse conditions. It's a matter of evolution. You'll be fine. 
__label__KIRK Tie us in. 
__label__KIRK She will not. She is fighting for her own identity. 
__label__KIRK That's a girl.
__label__KIRK I want a search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors. Notify the transporter room. Lock onto us. We're beaming up.
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. Let me know what you come up with. I'll be in the Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Chekov! Stop the torture! 
__label__KIRK It's likely. 
__label__KIRK That's a mistake. I'm no thief. 
__label__KIRK There wasn't enough time. 
__label__KIRK How long will he live?
__label__KIRK I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise. Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left. 
__label__KIRK We're getting out of here, Cochrane. Face up to it. I'll do anything I have to to save all of our lives. 
__label__KIRK If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise when complete. 
__label__KIRK Forever beloved. Forever. 
__label__KIRK What is it you want to know? 
__label__KIRK And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest?
__label__KIRK And at this distance? 
__label__KIRK That way. Spread out. Let's find it. 
__label__KIRK Flowers. I don't know the variety. 
__label__KIRK Did you find anything? 
__label__KIRK You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license. 
__label__KIRK You do know him well? An old friend? 
__label__KIRK I already don't like it. 
__label__KIRK But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear? 
__label__KIRK Is this where I hit you? 
__label__KIRK Let us remove the instrument of obedience, the way we did for McCoy. Natira. 
__label__KIRK Killing Lieutenant Romaine? 
__label__KIRK Excuse me. 
__label__KIRK Computer, verification scan. 
__label__KIRK Care to guess what she is? 
__label__KIRK Deflectors on. Condition yellow. 
__label__KIRK Mister Walking Bear, how  KUKULKAN [OC]: I was angered because I believed you had forgotten me.
__label__KIRK We'd better locate Crewman Green. Green! Green! Crewman Green, report! Green! (Nancy changes into Green) 
__label__KIRK Then where were you during the hour? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Those are undesirable qualities. 
__label__KIRK Through the use of a spy using the human form of Carter Winston. 
__label__KIRK Come on! 
__label__KIRK Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquillised body? 
__label__KIRK McCoy. No matter what he makes me say or do, the answer's no. 
__label__KIRK Have you got something to say? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus Three. One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.
__label__KIRK That's much too low a rating. 
__label__KIRK You did say thirty minutes? 
__label__KIRK That building in the centre. It seems to be important. 
__label__KIRK Do as I say. 
__label__KIRK You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas! 
__label__KIRK Why not? What's happened? 
__label__KIRK No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos. 
__label__KIRK Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant. These could be useful. Just remember one thing. To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Bridge. Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Is it within visual range? 
__label__KIRK You are the real one, Mister Atoz? 
__label__KIRK He just gave us reverse power. We lurched forward. 
__label__KIRK Well, let's assume that five thousand years ago creatures like our friend Apollo did indeed visit Earth and form the basis of the Greek classic myths. 
__label__KIRK All right. Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard. 
__label__KIRK How else is he going to get justice? 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK No doubt will remain. 
__label__KIRK Beauty survives.  
__label__KIRK But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, historical report. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I could sense it thinking, planning. 
__label__KIRK Wait a moment. 
__label__KIRK Who's in charge? I wish to speak to him. 
__label__KIRK Liar and rogue. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years. 
__label__KIRK We're stuck with it, Mister Spock. We'll have to make do with what we've got. 
__label__KIRK Which doesn't seem to be much. 
__label__KIRK Have one of our pillows? 
__label__KIRK Something that can't possibly exist, but it does.
__label__KIRK Crewman. 
__label__KIRK (opening the door) I don't think Starfleet would approve. Come on. 
__label__KIRK Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But first I want another look at that obelisk. 
__label__KIRK He's done nothing. Nothing at all. 
__label__KIRK How? 
__label__KIRK Yes, they're all through here, all over the place. Thousands of them. 
__label__KIRK How does he work it? 
__label__KIRK Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Then it isn't Nomad? 
__label__KIRK All right. Ahead warp factor two. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while. The Argelians will be the first to panic. Let's get back to the briefing room. 
__label__KIRK And that lake. 
__label__KIRK It must be a transporter malfunction. 
__label__KIRK Then why this? 
__label__KIRK Well, get back on course. 
__label__KIRK Not that much. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. Acknowledge. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK I am alone on the Enterprise. I have searched every area of the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew, or an indication of how its disappearance was managed. The one thing that is obvious is that I suffered a memory lapse, during which time I bruised my arm. It is causing me some irritation.
__label__KIRK You say this one man  LAZARUS: Not man! Thing. 
__label__KIRK The female of your kind. 
__label__KIRK The children. 
__label__KIRK Oh? Well, follow it.
__label__KIRK See to her, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Status. 
__label__KIRK You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Tommy. Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Very kind of you, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Yes. I know. 
__label__KIRK All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command. No one claims anyone without due process. 
__label__KIRK Looks like we did. 
__label__KIRK Okay, baby. Cool him till I flag you. 
__label__KIRK But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel? 
__label__KIRK Bones? Bones, answer me. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, ready the transporter room.
__label__KIRK It's not an instrument malfunction. It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon. A spaceship? 
__label__KIRK Fate, Spock? 
__label__KIRK No, but if it's reality, what happened? 
__label__KIRK It's your idea, Doctor. Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK On my way. Lazarus, you're with me. Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh. 
__label__KIRK Where's Kryton? 
__label__KIRK Try again. 
__label__KIRK I want him there whether he can walk or not.
__label__KIRK (signing a PADD) Thank you, Mister Mulney. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK You still haven't made any recommendation. 
__label__KIRK Are you responsible for stopping the ship? 
__label__KIRK No. You won't be destroyed. You'll be without your Controller for the first time, but you'll be much better off, I think. 
__label__KIRK He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates. 
__label__KIRK Murderer! You've killed Spock! 
__label__KIRK How long? 
__label__KIRK Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted. 
__label__KIRK Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves.
__label__KIRK Miranda, good luck, Health. I have something for you. 
__label__KIRK McCoy'll be along in a few days, perhaps sooner. There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together. This has to work. 
__label__KIRK What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK How? 
__label__KIRK Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Kirk out. Scotty, you have the conn. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three. 
__label__KIRK Secure from general quarters. Well done, Mister Sulu. Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Bob. 
__label__KIRK Get those shields   [Bridge] 
__label__KIRK We already have peace in the Federation. It wasn't imposed, it was agreed upon. You have no need of Spock. Reverse the effects of that machine and let us take him. 
__label__KIRK Here, we'll help you. 
__label__KIRK I've just picked up my clean uniforms from the service chute and when I put this one on, I discovered this. 
__label__KIRK We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher. Lang! 
__label__KIRK Patient? Our friend is dying. 
__label__KIRK You're looking good, Doc. 
__label__KIRK I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached. 
__label__KIRK Do what they want, sir? 
__label__KIRK Interesting. Telepathy. 
__label__KIRK Our minds will have survived. And as androids, we can move among the people who do live, teaching them, helping them not to make the errors we did. 
__label__KIRK You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Of a sort. Weapons, communication devices. Let me go to my friend. 
__label__KIRK Any ideas, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK Warp factor eight. 
__label__KIRK Take care of Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes. 
__label__KIRK No change. 
__label__KIRK I'm stimulating him. (McCoy pushes him back into the fight.) You have no choice. To use this ship, you have to use our form and now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three hundred years. 
__label__KIRK I will bring them. 
__label__KIRK Me? I don't want the job. 
__label__KIRK How long will it take to fix? 
__label__KIRK The power came on. 
__label__KIRK (grabbing his arm) No. 
__label__KIRK Parmen's mind is not (something flies past them very fast) Watch it! He's not only throwing around furniture, he's tearing up the Enterprise as well. Bones, knock him out fast. 
__label__KIRK All right, get the cutter beams on that hatch. Move. 
__label__KIRK Bones Spock, come here. 
__label__KIRK What became of them? 
__label__KIRK And burn up. I know, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Good night, Scotty. You dressed up for the occasion, Spock. Very impressive. 
__label__KIRK Engage. 
__label__KIRK Put it on visual, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Ten feet away from me. 
__label__KIRK We need you, your experience, your judgment. Matt! (Decker turns off the intercom) 
__label__KIRK No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft. 
__label__KIRK Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin? 
__label__KIRK What caused that? 
__label__KIRK I have found paradise. Surely no man has ever attained such happiness. 
__label__KIRK There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed. 
__label__KIRK All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you? 
__label__KIRK We'll continue our search. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Ready photon torpedoes. Fire one. 
__label__KIRK Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come. As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive. We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear. 
__label__KIRK Follow your instructions, Nomad. 
__label__KIRK Yes. That way. 
__label__KIRK Hold your fire. 
__label__KIRK That flight suit must be uncomfortable. (to Spock) Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters. 
__label__KIRK Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe.
__label__KIRK Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing away.
__label__KIRK Trelane. 
__label__KIRK Is that's all you can do, smile? 
__label__KIRK The miners must have broken into the hatchery. Their operations destroyed thousands of them. No wonder. 
__label__KIRK I said get back to your station. 
__label__KIRK Or the food could be a lure set by the Others to bring them in here. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the screen, extreme magnification. 
__label__KIRK As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up. 
__label__KIRK Am I interrupting something? 
__label__KIRK There are no good ways, Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Forty eight hours is better than nothing. Gather what you need and beam down here with it. 
__label__KIRK Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available? 
__label__KIRK Repeat what? The message I sent? 
__label__KIRK Deck five. 
__label__KIRK (bleeding) It's waiting for you. It may only be a matter of months. 
__label__KIRK You won't have anything to remember, because it never would have happened. 
__label__KIRK But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must be a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history. 
__label__KIRK How many men did we lose, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Yes, I remember. I remember. Helen. Look. The duct. The duct. Give me a hand here. Pull. (cover comes open) Air conditioning.
__label__KIRK Well, speculation isn't much help. We have to get in there. 
__label__KIRK Could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid? 
__label__KIRK All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet. 
__label__KIRK Full power to the shields, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney in a hard roll for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you. Mister Spock, this bag does not contain platinum, silver or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy. 
__label__KIRK Surak? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun. Fire a burst in a one-block radius around these co-ordinates. 
__label__KIRK You say you can communicate with it. Perhaps you can find out what we're doing here. 
__label__KIRK Warrant? Who? 
__label__KIRK That didn't spring from logic. 
__label__KIRK We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Are you ready? 
__label__KIRK So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it? Not on your life. I intend to fight. 
__label__KIRK I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible. 
__label__KIRK I would like  NONA: Happy. Yes. You feel good. 
__label__KIRK But you can't really love him. You haven't the slightest knowledge of love, the total union of two people. You are the Companion. He is the man. You are two different things. You can't join.
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Spock. You've made your point. Get into the uniform and hide those ears again.
__label__KIRK No. We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase. 
__label__KIRK Maintain. 
__label__KIRK You established the methods and the goals. 
__label__KIRK But these Providers haven't the courage to show themselves. 
__label__KIRK Take evasive action. 
__label__KIRK Good. I wonder how Spock's doing. 
__label__KIRK Exercise your prime function. 
__label__KIRK Captain James Kirk. 
__label__KIRK That's more like it. Since the Capellans never developed the bow, this may come as big a surprise as gunpowder was on Earth. 
__label__KIRK Will it hold? 
__label__KIRK Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister? 
__label__KIRK You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you understand? I'm part of you. You need me. I need you. 
__label__KIRK How bad? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK What's wrong? 
__label__KIRK Take care of Miramanee. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw. 
__label__KIRK Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything. 
__label__KIRK I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, let's go. 
__label__KIRK Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any sightings or sensor readings in their area. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, take command. 
__label__KIRK They took our phasers, communicators and other equipment so they must have some idea we're intelligent. 
__label__KIRK If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source. (raises his voice) Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen. After all, his actions are those of an immature, unbalanced mind. 
__label__KIRK Look ahead. 
__label__KIRK All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Fine. Yes, Chief. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Any other logical candidate? 
__label__KIRK Controls activated. 
__label__KIRK Spock! 
__label__KIRK On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important.
__label__KIRK Here. In this body. 
__label__KIRK Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments. Keep applying thrust against the pull. 
__label__KIRK Wait, listen. 
__label__KIRK Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My personal business,  SPOCK: Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship. 
__label__KIRK Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them? 
__label__KIRK You think you can get through to that thing? 
__label__KIRK I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them working. 
__label__KIRK I'll need a Romulan uniform. 
__label__KIRK Her son? We don't have time for children's games right now, Scotty, but beam us down. 
__label__KIRK It could be a trap, but it's the only way to get the drug. And Spock will die if we don't. 
__label__KIRK Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission. We're on our way in for R and R. There must be another starship in that sector. 
__label__KIRK Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents? 
__label__KIRK The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, mild. She had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs. Then she fought back in the only way she knew how, as any mother would fight when her children are in danger. 
__label__KIRK Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name? 
__label__KIRK Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. (sound on) Save your threats. If you board this ship, I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, there's only one Vulcan aboard that ship. He should be easy enough to locate. 
__label__KIRK You seem to need us. Why? 
__label__KIRK Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me. 
__label__KIRK It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported.
__label__KIRK Get Scott down below. 
__label__KIRK Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order.
__label__KIRK Spock, try and make contact. 
__label__KIRK I see. How did you manage  TRELANE: Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome. I want you to be happy. Free yourself of care. Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship. 
__label__KIRK Nona  NONA: Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing. 
__label__KIRK Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist without breathing. That goes for his present commander as well as his past.
__label__KIRK Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me? 
__label__KIRK Sound medical advice. 
__label__KIRK Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in.
__label__KIRK No. We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for. Is it medical? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range. 
__label__KIRK The beginnings of industrialisation. 
__label__KIRK True, Bones, but I'm sure there must be something in your little black pouch that can temporarily incapacitate our victim. 
__label__KIRK The practical advantages of such a weapon would seem to be limited. 
__label__KIRK It's impossible. The twentieth century had no such  [Transporter room]
__label__KIRK You killed two of my  NOMAD: Creator, your biological units are inefficient. 
__label__KIRK If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of this room alive. 
__label__KIRK The Federation has handled foreign invasions before. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two. 
__label__KIRK I'm trying not to. 
__label__KIRK Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe. 
__label__KIRK Missing for six years, and now this junk in space. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, beam us directly to Seven's apartment. 
__label__KIRK How's that special equipment coming along? 
__label__KIRK Miramanee! 
__label__KIRK Readings, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Just what do you think you were trying to do? 
__label__KIRK When does he get hungry? 
__label__KIRK McCoy. McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy.
__label__KIRK I'd like to talk to you. 
__label__KIRK Huh. And how's the research going? 
__label__KIRK I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you doing here?
__label__KIRK Deflector shields activated, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, ship status. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers.
__label__KIRK What have you done? 
__label__KIRK Missile spread, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Not these children, to this extent. It's incredible. 
__label__KIRK Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect? 
__label__KIRK Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu? 
__label__KIRK I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK You're somewhat different than the way history paints you, Colonel Green. 
__label__KIRK If we could locate the Keeper, he could save us a lot of time. 
__label__KIRK We were not spying, Commander. 
__label__KIRK As far as the rest of the crew's concerned, I'm still dead. 
__label__KIRK That will take months, perhaps years. We haven't that choice, Thalassa. 
__label__KIRK I want you to go on shore leave. Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble. 
__label__KIRK The Enterprise is pulling her biggest practical joke of all, and this time the joke's on the Romulans, the same Romulan ships that damaged the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, will you take the stand? 
__label__KIRK All right, Chief, begin materialisation.
__label__KIRK Yes, that's correct. 
__label__KIRK I did. 
__label__KIRK Something wrong, Darnell? 
__label__KIRK Besides, it isn't necessary. The chart said the tunnels meet further on.
__label__KIRK We have to get out of here within three hours. Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the mission. 
__label__KIRK I said I hoped I behaved correctly. 
__label__KIRK A brother that never existed, a phantom colony, imaginary distress calls, the creation of these weapons. Do you sense a pattern, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Is that you, Doctor Korby? 
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Then she'll die. 
__label__KIRK What is it?
__label__KIRK Whatever it is, it moves like a cat. 
__label__KIRK Good. Did you find out anything? 
__label__KIRK Certain you don't know what irritation is? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps. 
__label__KIRK Tomorrow in the palm of her hands. 
__label__KIRK Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank.
__label__KIRK I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it.
__label__KIRK She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations!
__label__KIRK Any pathological or unusual empathic responses? 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency. Emergency. 
__label__KIRK Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two. We'll head that way. 
__label__KIRK We've got to find him before he, but how? 
__label__KIRK Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will. 
__label__KIRK Where are we? 
__label__KIRK Doctor.
__label__KIRK For years.
__label__KIRK Read out official record of current command. 
__label__KIRK Nona.
__label__KIRK Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation. 
__label__KIRK How much security does this gadget require? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good hands. 
__label__KIRK I tried. 
__label__KIRK Try all frequencies. 
__label__KIRK Where's your wife? Where is she now? 
__label__KIRK Hold it. It's a communication device. 
__label__KIRK Let him go, too, Charlie. 
__label__KIRK Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can. At the moment, we're helpless. You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride. 
__label__KIRK All right, here we are, birds in a gilded cage. The question is, how do we get out of here? 
__label__KIRK Increase to warp six, Mister Scott. We may be racing against time. 
__label__KIRK Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters. Beam us up.
__label__KIRK Any other possibilities? 
__label__KIRK Any further transmissions, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Spock. (clears throat) Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You go on believing it, Flavius. All men are brothers. 
__label__KIRK These clothes. We stole them. We didn't have any money. 
__label__KIRK I'm sending him back. 
__label__KIRK A what? 
__label__KIRK Oh yes? You want him to die. What did you do to him on the Bridge? Did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes? 
__label__KIRK Until we learn more about it, Scotty, perhaps we should be ready to do the same. Take two of your men and arm the self-destruct device in the Engineering core. 
__label__KIRK Security alert.
__label__KIRK We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing. 
__label__KIRK Ensign, listen to me. 
__label__KIRK A partnership arrangement? You and me? 
__label__KIRK Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?
__label__KIRK McCoy's body? 
__label__KIRK Or anything else. Keep those deflectors up, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK What kind of things? 
__label__KIRK Very well, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes? 
__label__KIRK Yet on the other hand, my chief engineer's standing by for a message. 
__label__KIRK Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus. 
__label__KIRK See if you can bypass him. 
__label__KIRK I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.
__label__KIRK One final order, Engineer Scott. If we do not return, the Enterprise must not be taken. If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves. Is that clear? 
__label__KIRK Completely. 
__label__KIRK How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries we estimate.
__label__KIRK This is the captain. Scotty, report. 
__label__KIRK Get me some lights on her. 
__label__KIRK You are being used by him. 
__label__KIRK Instrument malfunction? 
__label__KIRK For hitting you. I'm sorry. 
__label__KIRK Analysis, gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK Caesar and Christ. They had them both. And the word is spreading only now. 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. 
__label__KIRK We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons. They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive.
__label__KIRK Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we humans. 
__label__KIRK Go. 
__label__KIRK I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu. Find out where those tracks came from. Doctor, you come with me back to the glade. I'd like another look at that area. 
__label__KIRK Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately. 
__label__KIRK Yes. We'd be glad to. We don't want to fight. 
__label__KIRK Are the instruments in order? 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Can you? 
__label__KIRK Is that a request or demand? 
__label__KIRK What do you make of the cat, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK The best thing we can do is Argh! 
__label__KIRK Good morning. 
__label__KIRK I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.
__label__KIRK Go to warp factor six. 
__label__KIRK Back on original course, Mister Chekov. Report on intruder's movements. 
__label__KIRK Mister Lurry, if there's no emergency, why did you issue a priority one distress call? 
__label__KIRK Mister Cochrane, call the Companion. 
__label__KIRK Good. Then it's safe for us to beam down to Dramia Two. Shall we, gentlemen? 
__label__KIRK You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago. How are you just picking it up now? 
__label__KIRK Not everything. 
__label__KIRK Sargon. 
__label__KIRK Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one. 
__label__KIRK Full sensor probe, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Cochrane We have a few things to do. 
__label__KIRK I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship. 
__label__KIRK Is it on the alien's course?
__label__KIRK It was taken out. It can be put back in. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor one. 
__label__KIRK What boundary layer? 
__label__KIRK What are you waiting for? Hurry! 
__label__KIRK After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface. That will give us a complete record. Will that satisfy you, Mister Hengist? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK John Gill, your Fuhrer. He's one of our people. 
__label__KIRK Goodbye Deela.  
__label__KIRK This may be my last entry. I am almost exhausted. Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left. Native sulphur, diamonds. This place is a mineralogist's dream. Yet there is something about sulphur. Something very old. Something? If only I could remember. 
__label__KIRK We've having difficulty. Patch historical computer into uniform section. I want McCoy outfitted as a Gestapo doctor Nazi Germany, old Earth date 1944. Make him a colonel. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over.
__label__KIRK Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them. 
__label__KIRK Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by. 
__label__KIRK Call Mister Scott to the bridge. 
__label__KIRK Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain.
__label__KIRK He drew the wrong conclusion from history. The problem with the Nazis wasn't simply that their leaders were evil, psychotic men. They were, but the main problem, I think, was the leader principle. 
__label__KIRK I thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive, captured if possible. 
__label__KIRK It's a native of Capella Four, isn't it? 
__label__KIRK Prepare to beam us up. 
__label__KIRK You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help. And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees. You might enjoy it. You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours. That's what we call freedom. You'll like it, a lot. And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be. Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other. That's what we call love. You'll like that, too, a lot. You and your children. 
__label__KIRK Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated. We lied to no one, Doctor. We violated no customs. Perhaps you'll explain to me why one of my men is dead. 
__label__KIRK Explanation? 
__label__KIRK What happened to my men? 
__label__KIRK Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space. 
__label__KIRK But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost. Why that example? 
__label__KIRK We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history  SPOCK: History cannot be changed. 
__label__KIRK Your new approach? 
__label__KIRK Course projection, Mister Arex. 
__label__KIRK Except possibly the destruction of that thing out there. Carry out your orders, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Earth. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Bones, it wasn't your fault. 
__label__KIRK Suspended animation. 
__label__KIRK Source of power? 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Fire phasers as directed, gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?
__label__KIRK You said you were picking up impressions. Are the aliens telepathic? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab. Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship. Have them measure it hour by hour. 
__label__KIRK Ambassador, when did you have these attacks? 
__label__KIRK Yes. You follow the rabbit. I'll backtrack the girl. I'll meet you around the other side of the hill.
__label__KIRK It's important. Please. 
__label__KIRK Go. 
__label__KIRK Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you. It is not an attack. It is a form of communication. You will permit it. 
__label__KIRK What has happened? 
__label__KIRK Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives. 
__label__KIRK No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned only a few. I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans, and I have hopes other than death for Odona. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there. 
__label__KIRK You knew Rizzo? 
__label__KIRK Tractor beam? How do we do that, Spock? 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all. 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them.
__label__KIRK I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir. 
__label__KIRK We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our lives. 
__label__KIRK Yes, we could act as a midwife giving birth to a star. Then we would have two novas in the same position and theoretically return home. 
__label__KIRK Where is he? 
__label__KIRK Check the armoury, and try and free those trapped crewmen. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that I can understand. 
__label__KIRK Jamie. This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified under my voice print or Mister Scott's. 
__label__KIRK The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. 
__label__KIRK Exactly. 
__label__KIRK Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well, Prefect, but there's only one way we can find out what it is Mister Scott cannot remember.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK I may be sentimental, but this is my favourite place. Earth. 
__label__KIRK What purpose will it serve to die? 
__label__KIRK That'll do. Full ahead, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Because we don't like you. Now. (shooing away gesture) 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. (mutes sound) They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now. 
__label__KIRK Is Jamie included in that deal? 
__label__KIRK Tragedy, Doctor.
__label__KIRK It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is increasingly serious. Continue present course. 
__label__KIRK Deflectors on. Condition Red. Protect yourselves. 
__label__KIRK Good. Maintain position. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with me. Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately. Scotty, you have the conn. 
__label__KIRK I'm calling you a babe. 
__label__KIRK Ready, Sargon. 
__label__KIRK It certainly looks like it. And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me. 
__label__KIRK Apollo has no difficulty focusing. He taps that energy, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK You feel up to it? 
__label__KIRK Very well. 
__label__KIRK Well, switch to by-pass circuits. 
__label__KIRK Play it. 
__label__KIRK Well somebody certainly did. 
__label__KIRK Will our clothing protect us? 
__label__KIRK You, gentlemen? In your condition? Don't be ridiculous. Mister Spock, this cafe has women that are so. (met with a Look) No, I guess not. Alone? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. 
__label__KIRK That's all right. It's all right, Alexander. Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help. 
__label__KIRK It could be a ship's log or a warning. It seems to keep repeating. 
__label__KIRK He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, the difference is meaningless. In comparison, we're all still children. 
__label__KIRK This is Kirk.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Sulu, activate tractor beams. 
__label__KIRK Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope. 
__label__KIRK There are none better. I suggest you make do with these. 
__label__KIRK Where is Landru? 
__label__KIRK You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you? 
__label__KIRK Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the chromosomes. We must destroy that organism. 
__label__KIRK If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and everything within a light year will be defenceless. 
__label__KIRK Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official action, I'd like to know Just what happened. Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale? What was in the grain that killed them? 
__label__KIRK Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering on our sensors? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, put this star sector on our screen. Now show our position. Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK It exists on the hate of others. 
__label__KIRK What do you call that stuff? Fire? 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Follow my voice. 
__label__KIRK Hyperacceleration is the key. I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration. They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me. Presumably, this is enslavement? Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile eventually. But when  DEELA: Damaged. 
__label__KIRK On my way, Garrovick. Security to three four one. Medical alert. Scotty, reverse cabin pressure three four one. 
__label__KIRK Most people are afraid of being alone. 
__label__KIRK We didn't do anything like that. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Like Sulu. If everybody on this planet is like him. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded. 
__label__KIRK It troubles you, Cochrane? 
__label__KIRK Chekov! 
__label__KIRK Position report, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.
__label__KIRK Five-minute report. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK How? Now you tell me how. All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water. Now you tell me, how it presents a danger to my ship? 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Our good doctor's been putting you on again. 
__label__KIRK Miranda? 
__label__KIRK You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it. 
__label__KIRK And I have to get back to my ship and figure out how I'm going to enter all this in my log. Tom. Martha. 
__label__KIRK A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it. 
__label__KIRK Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer? 
__label__KIRK Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK They will have to serve. 
__label__KIRK Well, if you don't think you can handle it  MCCOY: Forget it. I can do it. The last thing I want around is a ham-handed ship's captain. 
__label__KIRK And that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on defence alert? 
__label__KIRK Is it closing? 
__label__KIRK You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago? 
__label__KIRK Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk out. Follow me. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I suppose it would. 
__label__KIRK Kirk, affirmative.
__label__KIRK Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately.
__label__KIRK No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked. 
__label__KIRK Yes. It's Jim. 
__label__KIRK I said dig! 
__label__KIRK I'll have the truth now. 
__label__KIRK That's all, Spock. Dismissed. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Commodore, I know the feeling. 
__label__KIRK Ship to surface, Tantalus colony.
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you. 
__label__KIRK On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save ourselves. Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing less than slavery. We might never get help this far out. Or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you. 
__label__KIRK February 23rd, 1936. Six years from now. (reading below the headline FDR confers with slum area 'angel') The President and Edith Keeler conferred for some time today  (Then the whole thing goes up in flames.) 
__label__KIRK We believe it can be done. 
__label__KIRK There's no sickness on your planet, remember? 
__label__KIRK Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mister Spock. Excuse me. I sometimes expect too much of you. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Still thinking about Trelane, is that it? 
__label__KIRK How's Sarek? 
__label__KIRK Who are the Others? 
__label__KIRK Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no accounting for taste. (and back to Darvin) They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why. Bones? 
__label__KIRK All decks go to full alert. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Full sensor scan of the ship. Report on any movement by the Klingons. The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling tradition. They think they can beat us with swords. 
__label__KIRK Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Us? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, do you read me? 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Very well. 
__label__KIRK Lucien, do something. 
__label__KIRK Can you determine which ones? 
__label__KIRK Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us.
__label__KIRK Mister Sandoval, within the hour I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony. Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Your name, please. 
__label__KIRK No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem. 
__label__KIRK If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.
__label__KIRK What has all this got to do with the Enterprise? 
__label__KIRK Landru must die. 
__label__KIRK What caused it? 
__label__KIRK Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Serious? 
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK Spock, status on other ship. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe. 
__label__KIRK Can you identify it? 
__label__KIRK There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here? 
__label__KIRK No, Charlie. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two. Keep our forward shields to him. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Aurelan? Aurelan, it's Jim. 
__label__KIRK That was an order, helmsman. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Clear passageways immediately. The Ambassador will be escorted to his quarters at once. 
__label__KIRK Explanation. 
__label__KIRK The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. 
__label__KIRK Well done, Spock. They've kept what's left of him as a figure head. 
__label__KIRK Spock? Spock? Come in, Spock. Spock? We're stuck, blind, and deaf. 
__label__KIRK Freestyle? 
__label__KIRK Obsolete, but effective. 
__label__KIRK He keeps blinking no.
__label__KIRK We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner. 
__label__KIRK That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. All right.
__label__KIRK Er, Spock. 
__label__KIRK I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed.
__label__KIRK They don't operate. Agmar! 
__label__KIRK One third more thrust. 
__label__KIRK We're here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission. 
__label__KIRK Explain.
__label__KIRK Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and fifty years ago? You don't look over thirty five. 
__label__KIRK The boy belongs with his own kind. 
__label__KIRK If you don't reach him soon, he'll die. But that's what you want, isn't it? 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK See if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the ventilation system. 
__label__KIRK Peace. 
__label__KIRK No you're not. 
__label__KIRK Better and better, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Gone. 
__label__KIRK What is it you want? 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, beam me aboard. 
__label__KIRK Got to get McCoy. 
__label__KIRK All engines stop.
__label__KIRK Let me in there. I can help her. 
__label__KIRK But it hasn't (then it did) Someday I'll learn. 
__label__KIRK That ought to be just about right. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert.
__label__KIRK On what charge? 
__label__KIRK One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived with here. (He draws his phaser.) 
__label__KIRK Cover, Spock! Back! 
__label__KIRK Of course, Scotty, I'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're, er, we're on the level. But you know how it is. 
__label__KIRK Plot the new course, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Sulu! 
__label__KIRK Uhura, inform Starbase Twenty Three we have arrived at the gas cloud and are starting to map. 
__label__KIRK She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five. 
__label__KIRK Unless I miss my guess, that's friend Demos. 
__label__KIRK The impostor is not to be injured. Use minimum force. Repeat, the imposter  KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk! 
__label__KIRK Probably? 
__label__KIRK Bones, are you able to judge the long range effects on Lieutenant Romaine? 
__label__KIRK Professor Starnes? (the man has a phaser, and looks terrified.)
__label__KIRK The unfortunate accident he had as a child. He caught his head in a mechanical rice picker. But fortunately, there was an American missionary living close by who was actually a skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life. 
__label__KIRK We overcame our instinct for violence.  
__label__KIRK Activate beams. 
__label__KIRK Beam us up. 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Deflector shields up. Stand by phasers. (rolls a tribble off his chair) How fat do these things get? 
__label__KIRK Is it moving? 
__label__KIRK You'll find another Controller. 
__label__KIRK Which one are you now, the replica or the real one? 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double. 
__label__KIRK She was on the Enterprise. She must have done it. How did you do it? 
__label__KIRK And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal chords. It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your oratory on Starbase Four. 
__label__KIRK We're following the intruder ship's trail. 
__label__KIRK No wonder the Morgs are so obedient, and terrified. 
__label__KIRK You come from Rigel Four. 
__label__KIRK Captain to Enterprise. Captain to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK We're not gods! We're not evil ones. We're men, like yourselves. 
__label__KIRK Yes. We took a bite out of it. 
__label__KIRK Nobody but us chickens, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Cancel. Now we know. 
__label__KIRK We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos.
__label__KIRK What is it, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Well, that would be most unfortunate. Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port. 
__label__KIRK Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it. 
__label__KIRK At gunpoint?
__label__KIRK Pu-leese. 
__label__KIRK I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll be able to prove it. Never mind, Mister Spock. It doesn't make much sense to me either. Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister Sulu. Warp factor one.
__label__KIRK Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick. 
__label__KIRK Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I will.
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Sleep well, Miranda. 
__label__KIRK You're off course. I'm coming right up. 
__label__KIRK Well, the field's down, people are going in. Let's see what kind of luck we have. 
__label__KIRK You're going to have to take me on. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Spock? Spock! 
__label__KIRK No! 
__label__KIRK Security to engineering. 
__label__KIRK It happened twice. First we were in our own transporter chamber, then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. (the crewman begins to reach for her face) Lieutenant Uhura to the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK So far this thing has had its amusing aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny. 
__label__KIRK I see what you mean. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I can't understand why a simple cut like that could become so serious. 
__label__KIRK This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed. 
__label__KIRK Visual display of owner. Checks out. It seems we'll have a distinguished passenger with us for a while. 
__label__KIRK Fine. I'll see you in court, Harry. 
__label__KIRK That was quite a scene. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Commodore, Mrs. April. It looks as though we may not reach Babel. 
__label__KIRK Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal? 
__label__KIRK It is spectacular, isn't it? 
__label__KIRK It's not an arbitrary decision on my part. I have my orders. 
__label__KIRK History files. Subject, former Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four, also known as Kodos the Executioner. After that, background on actor Anton Karidian. 
__label__KIRK Affirmative.
__label__KIRK Acknowledged.
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk of  ROBERT: You'll have to speak louder. 
__label__KIRK Make that definite, Doctor. He's aboard.
__label__KIRK Surely there are better methods than this. 
__label__KIRK Sensors report several groupings of aborigines. They may be dangerous. So I want all of us to avoid any unnecessary risks. But these monitoring devices have to be planted. Lieutenant Uhura will be tracking us throughout. Now, if there's any trouble of any kind, beam up immediately. Don't try to be a hero. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. For a neutral, you were pretty quick to fire your phasers. 
__label__KIRK Must have been some insult. 
__label__KIRK I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Governor Cory, how do you feel? 
__label__KIRK How long can it keep on? 
__label__KIRK And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander. 
__label__KIRK Go to sensor probes. 
__label__KIRK Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel. We'll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers. All decks, stand by. 
__label__KIRK Wait. If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right decisions. 
__label__KIRK I didn't see it. 
__label__KIRK How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim. 
__label__KIRK Report on technology. 
__label__KIRK How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target? 
__label__KIRK You said you wanted our help. What is it you wish? 
__label__KIRK Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that. 
__label__KIRK Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen. 
__label__KIRK One is coming. I'd help you if I could, Marlena. Believe that. 
__label__KIRK No proof that Klingons committed it. 
__label__KIRK Power astern, half speed.
__label__KIRK So we do. 
__label__KIRK Explanation, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel. Stand by for firing orders. All hands, this is the Captain. We are going into battle. All hands, battle stations. Red alert. I repeat, red alert.
__label__KIRK So did l. Let's try a simple test. Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit. Nothing. 
__label__KIRK You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven, here on this planet? This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise man, fool, idol, slave. It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments. 
__label__KIRK That wasn't a minor difficulty. That wasn't a robot. That thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can't turn it off? 
__label__KIRK You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction?
__label__KIRK Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch, by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful. 
__label__KIRK I think we should get a few things straight. 
__label__KIRK Then perhaps your intelligence wasn't so great, Sargon. We faced a similar crisis in our early nuclear age. We found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves. 
__label__KIRK Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo? 
__label__KIRK Never mind, Spock. Just get on with the job. 
__label__KIRK Report.  SPOCK: The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out. 
__label__KIRK Stop it! 
__label__KIRK You seem to be the special favourite. 
__label__KIRK Yes, yes. If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase Ten. 
__label__KIRK Clear that tube, will you?
__label__KIRK Energise, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK I'm not sure they're sure. When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again. When did all this happen? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, can you gain altitude faster? I want to outdistance him. 
__label__KIRK I catch on quickly. 
__label__KIRK Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks. 
__label__KIRK We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our people. We mean no harm to you. We want to leave, peacefully. 
__label__KIRK And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise.
__label__KIRK You mean there'll be two of those things? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to transporter room. If you don't start beaming that crew over soon  SCOTT [OC]: They're not answering our signal. There's nothing to lock onto. 
__label__KIRK We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all. 
__label__KIRK Proceed. 
__label__KIRK That would be difficult to explain. 
__label__KIRK You fled. Why? Were you afraid? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, hailing frequencies. 
__label__KIRK All right. Let's hit it on the head. Scotty, did you kill Sybo? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Arex. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky.
__label__KIRK I'm Captain  THANN: We are aware of your identity, Captain. 
__label__KIRK Beam us aboard, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Oh. 
__label__KIRK You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters. 
__label__KIRK Captain here. 
__label__KIRK Guard.
__label__KIRK You'd wipe out four hundred lives? Why? 
__label__KIRK Norman. When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate. Why Norman? Unless  SPOCK: To function as they do, each android mind must be one component of a mass brain linked through a central locus. 
__label__KIRK Prepare to beam down to the planet surface fast. 
__label__KIRK Tell them. 
__label__KIRK Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom's right. I can do a lot of other things. Am I afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm fighting it? Am I that petty? 
__label__KIRK Full stop, Mister Chekov. Hold your position. 
__label__KIRK What have you done with Spock's brain? Where've you taken it? 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Good. I agree. That leaves me free  SPOCK: Free, Captain? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists? 
__label__KIRK What happened to them? 
__label__KIRK In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power. 
__label__KIRK Except a challenge. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's it. That's all of them. Signal Mister Spock that we're almost ready to beam up. I'll make a check of the files just in case. 
__label__KIRK You're going back with us. 
__label__KIRK When Mister Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately to the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Let me call my ship and inform them  KRAS: To bring down an attack upon their village? It is as I told you, Maab. Earthmen fear to bargain honestly. 
__label__KIRK Now, Mister Sulu! 
__label__KIRK (sitting down) Well, what do we do, just talk it over? 
__label__KIRK You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators? 
__label__KIRK You had something to say? 
__label__KIRK Then why are you here? 
__label__KIRK I will, but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx with me. 
__label__KIRK No sign of present life? 
__label__KIRK Here it comes. Is it raise or call?
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Kirk to  SCOTT: Carolyn. What's happened to her? 
__label__KIRK There's the shuttlecraft. 
__label__KIRK You said that. 
__label__KIRK Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You went in to investigate. 
__label__KIRK What are we dealing with, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK The pain is gone. She touched my head, and the pain is gone. 
__label__KIRK You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine. 
__label__KIRK No. We beamed it out into open space, Scotty. Widest possible dispersion. 
__label__KIRK Engage.
__label__KIRK Nine minutes of my life has been lost. 
__label__KIRK If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him. 
__label__KIRK I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on. 
__label__KIRK Korob seemed to think this was important. Said something about a transmuter. 
__label__KIRK Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field. The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years. No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time. 
__label__KIRK Why, Bones? Scotty's a good man. 
__label__KIRK Something like that. 
__label__KIRK But it is there. 
__label__KIRK We can beam up at any time. Any of us. 
__label__KIRK This hearing is closed. 
__label__KIRK Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet. But why? 
__label__KIRK I said no tricks after we reach the ship. You're a prisoner of the Federation of Planets against which you may or may not have committed an act of war. 
__label__KIRK Let me go. 
__label__KIRK Good old Virgil. We can always count on him. 
__label__KIRK Areel, you still haven't told me how you know so much about what the prosecution's going to do. 
__label__KIRK He seems he's overcoming his resentment. 
__label__KIRK Where is Spock? 
__label__KIRK Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for that. 
__label__KIRK This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas? 
__label__KIRK Villagers with flintlocks? That's impossible. They hadn't progressed nearly that far. 
__label__KIRK Leave my crew alone. (Charlie leaves) 
__label__KIRK Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you are! How wonderful for you. If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back. 
__label__KIRK Well, I think it would be wiser if  MCCOY: I'd like to go. I'm fine, Captain. 
__label__KIRK We'll hit Tchar. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, have Mister Scott beam down the phaser bore and (static) 
__label__KIRK Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. (moves away from the group) Yes, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Having trouble, gentlemen?
__label__KIRK You must help us. When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge. Yet, when we came here, you didn't. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean just there? 
__label__KIRK Why have we been repeatedly attacked and are now being held prisoner by a planet known for its hospitality? 
__label__KIRK Take it easy. 
__label__KIRK But not responsible. 
__label__KIRK That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one. 
__label__KIRK It was necessary. 
__label__KIRK Only half. The other half is human. Far more human than you, apparently. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, we have a patient for Doctor McCoy. Have Scotty beam us up. 
__label__KIRK I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there. 
__label__KIRK How does he manage to change form at will? 
__label__KIRK I expect the answer is already on its way. 
__label__KIRK Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said  KALO: I know what he said, bud. He said some of the boys would meet you. Okay, we're meeting you. 
__label__KIRK It's all right, Yeoman. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to speak directly to the governor. 
__label__KIRK Did you destroy the Malurian system? 
__label__KIRK I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have had the opposite effect. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Why? Tell me why. 
__label__KIRK Could we make a communicator? 
__label__KIRK Yes. What is the good? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Acknowledged. Continue standing by. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK No, it won't. 
__label__KIRK We've got pain-giving devices attached to us. Can you tell us how to get them off. 
__label__KIRK They communicate telepathically. 
__label__KIRK The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Lindstrom. 
__label__KIRK This is not a laboratory, Commander Bem. This is a hostile planet, and representatives of Starfleet are not experimental animals for you to test! Consider yourself under arrest. Protective custody, to keep you from any more escapades. Mister Spock, keep watch. 
__label__KIRK I would be honoured, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I agree. I waited until the last possible moment. We were on Red Alert. The storm got worse. I had to jettison the pod. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Whatever arguments you have between yourselves is your business. My business is running the ship. As long as I command, there will be order. 
__label__KIRK Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. It might even be practical. 
__label__KIRK Good. (puts it into a decoder) We both guessed right.
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters.
__label__KIRK Phasers stand by. 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phaser banks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu, continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer. Computers will control attack.
__label__KIRK Scotty, put a tractor beam on it. We'll take it in tow. 
__label__KIRK How are you doing, Doc? 
__label__KIRK Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake. Once that has been completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the authorities. You can make your case to them. 
__label__KIRK And if identical particles meet  LAZARUS: The end of everything. Civilisation, existence, all gone. I tried to stop him, Captain. That's why I took your dilithium crystals. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Agmar, but I don't like puzzles. Where are the rest of your people? 
__label__KIRK If you two have complaints, you can bring them out into the open.
__label__KIRK Gary, forgive me. 
__label__KIRK How many alive? 
__label__KIRK How are you, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse. 
__label__KIRK Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range. 
__label__KIRK Spock, what the devil is this all about? 
__label__KIRK You're thinking the same thing I am. Mister Spock, the plug must be pulled. 
__label__KIRK All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse.
__label__KIRK It's the Constellation. Look at that. 
__label__KIRK Please, not again.
__label__KIRK No. No! Let me alone! Please! They're destroying me! Tearing my mind to, to  (Scott and Baby beam back down. Mum and Dad rush to them) 
__label__KIRK Open it. 
__label__KIRK No, but I'm sure he's all right.
__label__KIRK They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore, for shore leave. They've assured me that our people will have a wonderful time. 
__label__KIRK Charlie's a seventeen year old boy. 
__label__KIRK Just incredibly prolific. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Who caught you? 
__label__KIRK Something corresponding to that. The records say every ship lost here vanished without a trace. Most logged communication loss and disorientation just before disappearance. My guess was they entered a window to some other continuum. Comments, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Triangulate on this location. 
__label__KIRK Got it. Sord. 
__label__KIRK This apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last. I suggest we find out as much as we can about it. Split up. D'Amato, see if you can find underground water. 
__label__KIRK I got a better idea. This planet has to be united. You know that.
__label__KIRK Then use your imagination. Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines. Discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out of there with the main section, but get that ship out of there! 
__label__KIRK I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK What kind? 
__label__KIRK No. I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing. 
__label__KIRK Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything. 
__label__KIRK Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. 
__label__KIRK Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle. 
__label__KIRK Bones, no! 
__label__KIRK Hmm?
__label__KIRK Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man.
__label__KIRK You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas present for you?
__label__KIRK They need us to get through the time barrier, if they're to get through at all. Security, this is Captain Kirk. I want all security teams on duty around the clock. Watch every Klingon who sets foot aboard this ship. I don't want one of them to make a move we don't know about. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, prepare a probe. Scotty, we'll need a magnetic bottle for the charge. How soon? 
__label__KIRK We apologise for intruding. We did not realise the situation. We will leave. We will tell others of our kind not to bother you here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming tapes have been altered. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, assist. 
__label__KIRK Come in, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Anything. 
__label__KIRK I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you should know now. It's xenopolycythemia. 
__label__KIRK Don't move! (hands it to Spock) Cover them. Now, I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment. I want some answers. 
__label__KIRK James Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. First Officer Spock. Our physician, Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Kill him! Kill him! 
__label__KIRK Is anyone on that ship alive? 
__label__KIRK First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland where there was supposedly no animal life. And Sulu's gun where there's no refined metal detected. Rodriguez' birds. And then my, well, the two people I saw. 
__label__KIRK Yes, yes. Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK What have you done with Spock's brain? 
__label__KIRK Bridge, this is the Captain.
__label__KIRK No. No! I am responsible for the actions of my people. I demand to see the Providers. 
__label__KIRK Bones, let them help. 
__label__KIRK I won't submit to this petty search for revenge! 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force. 
__label__KIRK Coronation? 
__label__KIRK Janice, hello. 
__label__KIRK That's it. End of a long, hard journey. 
__label__KIRK Open the vent. On my way to the bridge. Kirk out. Ensign Garrovick. 
__label__KIRK Forget precision. Will it work? 
__label__KIRK Natural growths? What kind? 
__label__KIRK Helm control? 
__label__KIRK There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. I want them conscious. 
__label__KIRK Some kind of generator? 
__label__KIRK A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget. 
__label__KIRK Not without special equipment, which we don't have. Either we find a way to reach it from here, or we fail. 
__label__KIRK Doctor? 
__label__KIRK to you, friend. Joy and tranquillity. 
__label__KIRK You have something to report? 
__label__KIRK Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?
__label__KIRK Maintenance note. My recording computer has a serious malfunction. Recommend it either be corrected or scrapped. Compute. 
__label__KIRK So is he. 
__label__KIRK No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return. 
__label__KIRK If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what we've done. If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them. Does everybody remember what to do? 
__label__KIRK That's why you have no resistance? 
__label__KIRK Weapons status? 
__label__KIRK It doesn't matter, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK There are many things I'd like to know  (he's interrupted by rapid gunfire.) 
__label__KIRK Cancel Red Alert. We'll beam right down. 
__label__KIRK Table manners, for one thing. This is a plate. It contains food.
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk to medical lab. 
__label__KIRK Hmm. Or it could be the sender. Lieutenant Uhura, all stations to Yellow Alert. Standard hailing on all frequencies. Identification, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Have you tried all hailing frequencies?
__label__KIRK Can you help him? 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, your report. 
__label__KIRK You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first chance you get? Spock. Get out. I never want to have to look at you again. 
__label__KIRK Cancel Red Alert, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK What is it you want to tell me? 
__label__KIRK And what am I supposed to do? 
__label__KIRK And useless to them. Theela said the other men of the crew would join us here. They'll be lured into the same trap. We've got to contact the ship. 
__label__KIRK (giving the pistol to Isak) Cover the door. 
__label__KIRK Get out of the way. (McCoy and Kirk struggle for the phaser while Nancy grabs and eats the salt tablets. McCoy wins and is pushed away, then she transfixes Kirk and reaches for his face) 
__label__KIRK Captain to Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, commence firing and maintain. 
__label__KIRK Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as he gets, he'll have all that inside him. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation  ENWRIGHT [OC]: The explanation is beaming aboard now, Captain. He may already be in your transporter room. 
__label__KIRK Mister Krako, I don't, er  KRAKO: So this is the fancy heater, huh? How does it work? 
__label__KIRK 2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes. And we never got it. Just lucky, I guess.  
__label__KIRK Scotty, inform Starfleet Command. Disengage nacelles, Jettison if possible. Mister Spock, assist them. Advise and analyse. Scotty? Scotty? 
__label__KIRK We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you. 
__label__KIRK That's it. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them. 
__label__KIRK Spock, McCoy, follow my voice. Do you hear me? Keep following my voice. Spock. McCoy.  SPOCK: This must be it. 
__label__KIRK All right. Man your station, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I want you to prepare for surgery. 
__label__KIRK May I have your permission to go? 
__label__KIRK Can you tell me what happened? 
__label__KIRK Are you afraid of cars? 
__label__KIRK Get engineering, Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Chris, if there's anything I can do for you. (flash, flash)
__label__KIRK An undersea civilisation capable of fantastic architecture.
__label__KIRK What are Grups? 
__label__KIRK To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells. If there's any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman.
__label__KIRK If you gentlemen are finished, would you mind laying in a course for Starbase Ten, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK What do I have? 
__label__KIRK Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy? 
__label__KIRK Bones! Shake him. Break his concentration. 
__label__KIRK If you're not in command, who is? 
__label__KIRK Very well. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Request denied. 
__label__KIRK The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we survived? 
__label__KIRK They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like. 
__label__KIRK You're a Metron?
__label__KIRK Scotty, what happened? 
__label__KIRK But we are going to Scalos? 
__label__KIRK I'll obey. Let him go. 
__label__KIRK Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations. 
__label__KIRK He's dead. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Sulu. We're all right. You may beam us aboard. 
__label__KIRK Phaser Crew stand ready.
__label__KIRK Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same. Only this one works. 
__label__KIRK Understood, Engineer. Mister Spock? We can't avoid these areas of turbulence. 
__label__KIRK Spock! It's all right, Spock. It stopped. 
__label__KIRK Now listen to me. You must listen to what I have to say. Give me one moment to speak to you. One moment. Natira, if you don't believe what I'm about to tell you, you can call the guards. We'll accept any punishment you decree. 
__label__KIRK All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones. 
__label__KIRK I'm being falsely accused. You know that. 
__label__KIRK Just hold out a little longer. 
__label__KIRK Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps it understands another kind of language. Condition Red Alert. Prepare for phaser firing. 
__label__KIRK What do you make of all this? 
__label__KIRK Do they come from the sky? 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, can you hear me? 
__label__KIRK We're all in a trap. This is the only way out. 
__label__KIRK Bones! 
__label__KIRK We hope to be finished long before that. 
__label__KIRK Not with the Earps. There is one other place I can try. 
__label__KIRK What needs? 
__label__KIRK (holding Trelane back) Yeoman Teresa Ross. I believe you have met our science officer Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Spock. Sit down. We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the drug you need. 
__label__KIRK How long do we have, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK Captain to Bridge. 
__label__KIRK But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't. 
__label__KIRK Stop! You'll hurt him. 
__label__KIRK I'm plotting an intercept course. Will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours. 
__label__KIRK Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Is it within visual range? 
__label__KIRK On my way, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in forty eight hours. 
__label__KIRK This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system. 
__label__KIRK Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise, with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war. 
__label__KIRK Sulu had the same observation. Any explanations? 
__label__KIRK The secrets were passed on from father to son? 
__label__KIRK I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for me. 
__label__KIRK You do anything you think necessary to protect the ship. Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything. Clear? 
__label__KIRK Die from something that can't be seen? You astound me, Vanna.
__label__KIRK Sulu, take it easy. 
__label__KIRK What's that? 
__label__KIRK Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't have a chance. The Organians raided the game.  
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here. I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before. 
__label__KIRK Let's try. (a gentle but lingering kiss) See? No change.
__label__KIRK There is, of course, no escape. How would it be? Trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat until time itself came to a stop?
__label__KIRK It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Uhura. Beautiful! 
__label__KIRK Ready the transporter room, Mister Spock. We're beaming down.
__label__KIRK That's your problem, Trelane. Everything is easy. It's given you a bad habit. You're not aware of it, but you have it. You don't think, Trelane. That's your problem. You miss opportunities, like your anger before and mine right now. Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool. 
__label__KIRK Anyone hurt here? 
__label__KIRK There's no data, no starting point. 
__label__KIRK Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind? 
__label__KIRK You're not certain of what? 
__label__KIRK I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why. 
__label__KIRK It's staying with us. 
__label__KIRK Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise.
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Second?
__label__KIRK Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful. 
__label__KIRK Mister Advisor! 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Take a close look at me. 
__label__KIRK All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration.
__label__KIRK Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily? 
__label__KIRK Mallory! Marple, stand back! Watch it! The rocks! (kneeling by the body) Kaplan. Hendorff. I know Kaplan's family. Now Mallory. 
__label__KIRK Yes, and the food they have gathered is Bem. 
__label__KIRK We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! (goes to mirror, covers scratches with makeup, opens door)
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK How could he survive? 
__label__KIRK Give it back, then we'll talk. 
__label__KIRK Well, Spock, any conclusions? 
__label__KIRK You're killing me. You're killing me.
__label__KIRK He's pretty fast with that whip. 
__label__KIRK Trouble. (one man materialises) Jackson, where are the others? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time. 
__label__KIRK Engage, warp factor one.
__label__KIRK What about it, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Towards the north-west, toward the city Scotty reported. 
__label__KIRK You say that we forgot you. How can you expect us to regard you as a deity if we don't remember you? 
__label__KIRK Listen to me! You've got our communicators, the boxes we talk into. We need them to talk to the ship. 
__label__KIRK Fire at minimum range. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Security. What's the status on the search for the Vendorian? 
__label__KIRK Swindler and con man  MUDD: Entrepreneur. 
__label__KIRK What about the Antares? 
__label__KIRK We have three. We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans.
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire. 
__label__KIRK You still haven't answered my question. Either you tell me what's happened to my people  AREX [on viewscreen: Here we are, Captain. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK The confidence of an innocent man. 
__label__KIRK I know. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott? Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Your Excellency. 
__label__KIRK That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people. 
__label__KIRK What have we got, Mister Spock? A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon. A mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK And? 
__label__KIRK Yes? 
__label__KIRK No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there.
__label__KIRK Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering.
__label__KIRK Kirk to boarding party. 
__label__KIRK Chekov, maintain your post! 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you. 
__label__KIRK Burns them out. Compton was burned out. The device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know. 
__label__KIRK Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then. 
__label__KIRK Doc. 
__label__KIRK You have a knack for giving me difficult choices. (kisses her again) You have nothing like that where you come from? 
__label__KIRK What would be the point? You've already made up your minds.
__label__KIRK What is this place? 
__label__KIRK Was he wrong, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight? 
__label__KIRK Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment? 
__label__KIRK I believe in you. 
__label__KIRK But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact.
__label__KIRK We still haven't heard the full story. I vote to continue.
__label__KIRK And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why? 
__label__KIRK If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l? 
__label__KIRK It's gone. I could have been wrong. The last time I caught an odour like that was eleven years ago. 
__label__KIRK There've been no Earth colonists a sixteenth of an inch tall. 
__label__KIRK All right. 
__label__KIRK Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand.
__label__KIRK He would have been rather difficult to stop. 
__label__KIRK A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh other factors. Intuition, however illogical, Mister Spock, is recognized as a command prerogative. 
__label__KIRK You do that. Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK Yes, Doctor, quickly. 
__label__KIRK Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Well, there are better things for men and women to do. 
__label__KIRK What did she die of? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, let's get out of here, through that grid. 
__label__KIRK This is a new race. They offer other things of value besides dilithium crystals. 
__label__KIRK Common stones? Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system. May I have this? 
__label__KIRK Let's find the alien. (to Mara) You come with us. Maybe we can prove to you that it exists. 
__label__KIRK Miramanee. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean, who's he? You know Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. 
__label__KIRK Very well, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Activate phaser banks. 
__label__KIRK Five to beam up.  
__label__KIRK A vessel of some kind?
__label__KIRK What about the Keeper of the planet. Did anyone see him? 
__label__KIRK No. I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humour. 
__label__KIRK Impossible. It should have been destroyed instantly. 
__label__KIRK The Exeter. she was patrolling in this area six months ago. I hadn't heard of any trouble. 
__label__KIRK Approve of it? We're your prisoners. 
__label__KIRK And they'll get their answers if it kills us. 
__label__KIRK Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Come in! 
__label__KIRK Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Do you have any further information? 
__label__KIRK Welcome aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Get that ship out of here, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK You're two of a kind. 
__label__KIRK I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper. 
__label__KIRK If that's what you want. 
__label__KIRK I'll tell him you were properly annoyed. 
__label__KIRK Dead I am of no use to you. 
__label__KIRK Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio. 
__label__KIRK Now, now, Demos. You're hardly in a position to take on an entire crew. 
__label__KIRK All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship. 
__label__KIRK This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her. Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work. 
__label__KIRK That is the problem, sir. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. What is it? 
__label__KIRK What is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present position? 
__label__KIRK Pick it up.
__label__KIRK We were? What could she learn from us? 
__label__KIRK Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he needs our help. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?
__label__KIRK Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Security to Engineering. Intruder alert. Security alert to all decks. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Lock on second target. 
__label__KIRK Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry. 
__label__KIRK All do. The cave is deep in our memory. 
__label__KIRK Snap out of it! Start acting like men. 
__label__KIRK The design of the ship is the same. Mister Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us. 
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK I don't know. There's been a mistake. 
__label__KIRK Medical department report, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Bones. (Spock's body stands up and they walk out of the room) 
__label__KIRK That's right. 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not turn out to be very pretty. 
__label__KIRK And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible. 
__label__KIRK And whether it wants to or not. 
__label__KIRK Exactly. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full power deflector screens. 
__label__KIRK A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe. Beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon. An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club. Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them. Where?
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one.
__label__KIRK And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt tablets. 
__label__KIRK You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew. 
__label__KIRK The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone along with what and who you think you are. 
__label__KIRK No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear? 
__label__KIRK What about the Federation science team working there? Doctor Manway had a special transmitter. 
__label__KIRK Spock. What happened? 
__label__KIRK Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try. 
__label__KIRK Out of the nowhere into the here. 
__label__KIRK I certainly think that science might provide an answer. 
__label__KIRK Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock. I want it. Marple, cut around the rock to your right.
__label__KIRK I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function! 
__label__KIRK There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in tow. I'll stay onboard and get her ready. You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you. 
__label__KIRK I am the Kirk, the creator? 
__label__KIRK Did you take them? 
__label__KIRK Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Lord Garth. 
__label__KIRK Tractor beam?
__label__KIRK How did all this happen? 
__label__KIRK I have no choice. 
__label__KIRK With a very long memory. 
__label__KIRK If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin immediately. Correction,  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK Put it down. Do what I say. 
__label__KIRK Oh, Bones. Doc. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation chamber in ten minutes? All dilithium crystals, full power. 
__label__KIRK Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Commodore. 
__label__KIRK The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes. 
__label__KIRK Bones. What are you doing here? (their voices wake Tyree) Tyree.
__label__KIRK Then get back to Sickbay! 
__label__KIRK After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your hand? 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here! 
__label__KIRK My crew. 
__label__KIRK Security, this is the captain. Find Mister Chekov and bring him to the bridge. 
__label__KIRK What did she see? 
__label__KIRK McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably.
__label__KIRK I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars. If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations.
__label__KIRK Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem. 
__label__KIRK Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. All search parties  [Kirk's quarters]
__label__KIRK Kirk to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Wouldn't it be something to watch, to be a part of? To see it happen all over again? Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Ahead warp factor one. 
__label__KIRK What is it, Gabler. 
__label__KIRK Don't fire. First man that fires is dead. 
__label__KIRK What have you got there, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there. 
__label__KIRK Sonny! Wait a moment. What have they done? What have they done to you? What have you done? 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital. If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way. Clear, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know who on board the Enterprise is receiving.
__label__KIRK So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Because I delayed in firing at it. 
__label__KIRK That's right. 
__label__KIRK Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect. 
__label__KIRK Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without. 
__label__KIRK Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2. We have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and the Gamma Seven=A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life. Both Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it, and free the ship. Doctor McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge.
__label__KIRK Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in. 
__label__KIRK I see. Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Nored, you could've stopped him. Why didn't you fire? 
__label__KIRK Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts.
__label__KIRK I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK (looking up a Jefferies tube) Say, you didn't get this one, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, let's hear that tape backward, which should sound forward to us. 
__label__KIRK That's exactly what I mean. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, energise. 
__label__KIRK (in pain) They're in my head. What happened to the baby? What happened? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, can you get us some more light? 
__label__KIRK Well, I've got an idea about that. (goes over to the card table and gets guns pointed at him) Gentlemen. Gentlemen. This, card game is a kid's game. 
__label__KIRK Traces? 
__label__KIRK Transporter room. 
__label__KIRK Put it on audio, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend? 
__label__KIRK You could have selected a more convenient place, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK (taking Scott's communicator) What is it, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK We have two days to find them. 
__label__KIRK Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, I'm bewildered, that's all. But that's enough. 
__label__KIRK Ambassador. 
__label__KIRK Yes, very perceptive, Mister Sulu. I know where the course change takes us. Execute. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me. 
__label__KIRK Why is that unusual? They want to get out of here as much as we do. 
__label__KIRK Accidents happen. Cut off back-up systems malfunction. We were due for overhaul two months ago. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. 
__label__KIRK She has five seconds to live. Reply. 
__label__KIRK You said it yourself, Spock. It wants terror, not just death. 
__label__KIRK Anything unusual? 
__label__KIRK Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again?
__label__KIRK He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he? You've got that minute. 
__label__KIRK My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here. 
__label__KIRK They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician. 
__label__KIRK Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman. 
__label__KIRK There are certain things men must do to remain men. Your computer would take that away. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy will explain it to you. 
__label__KIRK Yes. (Notices the piles of books everywhere) What is all this? 
__label__KIRK Magnification four, helm. 
__label__KIRK But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky. 
__label__KIRK Yeah I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal in it.
__label__KIRK Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed (passes out, the other one wakes up) 
__label__KIRK You, perhaps? 
__label__KIRK Name the Joining day. 
__label__KIRK No award of custody? 
__label__KIRK I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer. 
__label__KIRK And you're proud of it. 
__label__KIRK Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space sector we're patrolling now. No alien problems.
__label__KIRK Cotton wadding. Try the apothecary. 
__label__KIRK Whose history? 
__label__KIRK Who is Vaal? 
__label__KIRK Is this all? 
__label__KIRK You speak of his body. I speak of his spirit. Companion, inside the shelter, a female of our species is dying. She will not continue.
__label__KIRK Yes, we were, Commodore. 
__label__KIRK Is there any possibility  FARRELL [OC]: Landing party, this is the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here before we make any more trouble. 
__label__KIRK Was it radiation as suggested? 
__label__KIRK Security control, this is the Bridge. Come in.
__label__KIRK I believe you mean that. 
__label__KIRK He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock, something happened. 
__label__KIRK We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal satisfaction. Is that clear? Let's try down there. 
__label__KIRK I can't say I think much of your welcome. 
__label__KIRK All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys! (takes the phaser back) 
__label__KIRK If an alien needed a body. 
__label__KIRK Timothy, I haven't seen you since the Vulcanian expedition. (no reply) Well, I see our graduating class from the Academy is well represented. Corrigan. Teller. How you doing, Mike? 
__label__KIRK An entire attack force against my ship? 
__label__KIRK What do you read, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK He called my bluff. 
__label__KIRK Bones, this isn't a planet. It's a space ship on a collision course with Daran Five. 
__label__KIRK Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is harmless. But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's harmless.
__label__KIRK I don't know. (collapses)
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow.
__label__KIRK We could remain forever awed with the differences between our universes, Karla Five, but we must discover a way to return to our positive matter universe. 
__label__KIRK Returned from where? 
__label__KIRK Has the first shore party beamed down yet?
__label__KIRK Yes. But we're not in that position yet. 
__label__KIRK I know every sound that this ship might make. That's coming from outside. 
__label__KIRK It's got to work. 
__label__KIRK Your actions all but lost us our ship. 
__label__KIRK Put them on the screen. 
__label__KIRK Sensors, a meteorite? 
__label__KIRK I'll be right there.
__label__KIRK McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Is this how you greet all your guests? 
__label__KIRK How is she? 
__label__KIRK If you're about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones. 
__label__KIRK What?
__label__KIRK I had orders to come here. Why did your people tell us to stay away? 
__label__KIRK Course, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK I took that chance. I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong. 
__label__KIRK How bad is it? 
__label__KIRK Enough talk. Let's get on with it. 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I think I do. I don't know how I know, but home is where it fought a starship once before. Ito Uhura) Inform them of our tactical situation and inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature. We will rendezvous. Round-trip time, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK It's time for action, gentlemen. Mister Bailey  BAILEY: Bridge to Phaser Gun Crew KIRK: Countermand. I'll select what kind of action.
__label__KIRK An entire human colony, a whole settlement. One hundred men, women and children. Who did it? And why? (communicator beep) Kirk here.
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check in. All departments tie in with the record computer. Report casualties and operational readiness to the First Officer. Kirk out. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Control. I want them alerted to the position of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most. You, I presume, felt nothing? 
__label__KIRK You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Fire phasers. 
__label__KIRK Your analysis, Spock. What is it? 
__label__KIRK I cannot take sides. 
__label__KIRK Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to learn. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant. 
__label__KIRK A few seconds, Scotty. We have to give Spock that much. 
__label__KIRK Not exactly. 
__label__KIRK Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay? 
__label__KIRK Are we within transportation range? 
__label__KIRK How long before we get a full answer? 
__label__KIRK Let's get back to the ship. 
__label__KIRK I can't seem to stand up. 
__label__KIRK (reading from a newspaper pinned up) October 26, 1881. Tombstone, Arizona. 
__label__KIRK No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us. We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action. Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap? 
__label__KIRK At least let me talk to you! 
__label__KIRK What's that? 
__label__KIRK But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you? 
__label__KIRK All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple turns. Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes closed. 
__label__KIRK Any indication of danger from it?
__label__KIRK Shoot. You're wasting time. 
__label__KIRK There's just one thing I want. 
__label__KIRK You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you? What were you doing in space at the age of eighty seven? 
__label__KIRK Take the helm!
__label__KIRK Bridge to Engineering. Mister Scott, why are we losing speed? 
__label__KIRK Obviously a man of good taste. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in. Kirk out. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Does it really matter? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I've spoken to Winston on this at some length. He has assured me it is absolutely vital to get to Ratar Three in the shortest possible time. The survival of the entire planetary population may depend on it. 
__label__KIRK What is the projected course of this thing? 
__label__KIRK Never mind about me. Protect my ship! 
__label__KIRK You fired at a large, hovering target at that distance and missed? 
__label__KIRK Scotty. Sorry to keep you waiting. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?
__label__KIRK M-5? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK Get a crew down to transporter room three. We have twenty minutes left while we can still operate transporter controls. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Arex. Since we appear to have only one way out, we're going to take it. Mister Sulu, takes us to that central core area. 
__label__KIRK No, I think we'll use a  SULU: Captain, we've checked out everything. It all seems normal, except for the absence of any animals. 
__label__KIRK Speculation, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Can you tap into it? 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing twenty seven, mark eight. 
__label__KIRK Morning. (drags Christopher along) Captain. 
__label__KIRK Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons. 
__label__KIRK I've got command. I've got command. I've got command. 
__label__KIRK Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare. Kang has got to listen.
__label__KIRK Then we've got to get those men up. 
__label__KIRK Get me Sickbay.
__label__KIRK Put phasers on standby, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK What are their demands? 
__label__KIRK Continue alert, decks four through eleven.
__label__KIRK Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report. 
__label__KIRK Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies. 
__label__KIRK This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see outside. If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up. I don't agree with you, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK This thing has a negative energy charge. Everything seems to work in reverse. We'll use anti-matter. 
__label__KIRK I've done it. (The booth finally blows up.) Come on, let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Nothing? 
__label__KIRK Standard orbit around the planet. There may be survivors there. 
__label__KIRK Beam us up, quickly. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What's happening? 
__label__KIRK I think not, Harry. 
__label__KIRK Well, we have a shadow. Faster, more manoeuvrable and unidentified. Mister Spock, full analysis of sensor readings. I want to know who that intruder is.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__KIRK You said you had some additional information, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it. 
__label__KIRK The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back. 
__label__KIRK Never mind, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor Daystrom. 
__label__KIRK Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Spock. 
__label__KIRK All you men going on shore leave to stay in groups. Avoid trouble with the Klingons. 
__label__KIRK If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security. 
__label__KIRK Can you trust all your men? 
__label__KIRK Isn't Governor Cory joining us? 
__label__KIRK Voyage? Where? 
__label__KIRK Captain's quarters. Aren't you the one who always says a little suffering is good for the soul?
__label__KIRK Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles? 
__label__KIRK It's all right. Let him go. 
__label__KIRK What does it look like? 
__label__KIRK No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Spock? Your phaser. (it is missing, so Kirk prepares to use his to defend his friend.) 
__label__KIRK Yes, I  SPOCK: Captain! 
__label__KIRK Evasive action. 
__label__KIRK Bridge to transporter room. Prepare to energise. 
__label__KIRK Look at his face. 
__label__KIRK In a manner of speaking, yes. We control it. It sustains us. 
__label__KIRK Hold it right there, Mister Seven. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, you have the conn.
__label__KIRK Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels.
__label__KIRK Then what are you? 
__label__KIRK Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building. 
__label__KIRK I'm going up to the bridge. 
__label__KIRK I don't follow you. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Shut down all unnecessary systems. Get every ounce of impulse power. We've got to get away from this planet. 
__label__KIRK Peace and tranquillity to you. (in a whisper) Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Consider yourself on report. This is no time for heroics. I have no intention of sacrificing myself, at least not yet. (into communicator) Spock? Spock? 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan. 
__label__KIRK Exactly. McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, lie to me. How old are you? 
__label__KIRK And came here to swindle honest miners. 
__label__KIRK No, that won't be necessary. Mister Spock will make the mind-link. No other decision is possible. 
__label__KIRK What happened to him? 
__label__KIRK Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Which is what we've been experiencing. The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK (dictating) At Federation orders, we're proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only source of zenite exists. It is the one substance that can halt the plague. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon. 
__label__KIRK Mister Arex, what is our speed? 
__label__KIRK We have no weapons. And if we did, we would use them only with reason. 
__label__SPOCK Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose.
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir.
__label__SPOCK We may simply render it powerless. 
__label__SPOCK No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function.
__label__SPOCK Marker on course. Heading back the way we (big bang)
__label__SPOCK Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK It will of course have to be left behind. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark seven. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to engineering. 
__label__SPOCK Tricorder readings confirm a solid shell of granite and metal alloy, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus. 
__label__SPOCK Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells.
__label__SPOCK Position? 
__label__SPOCK Deep Space Station K7 now within sensor range, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Clean, fed, in good health, and resting. 
__label__SPOCK You'll have to hold on to him, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Not living tissue. 
__label__SPOCK It would be a great prize. 
__label__SPOCK Improbable, Captain. The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead. The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of Parmen's delirium. 
__label__SPOCK It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it. 
__label__SPOCK Explain. 
__label__SPOCK I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away. 
__label__SPOCK That is an impossibility. 
__label__SPOCK That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK I shall make an attempt, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK If you'll permit me, Captain, I might be able to get McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK But he evidently intended that you continue living. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. And it is accelerating. 
__label__SPOCK Are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace? 
__label__SPOCK The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you being stoned? 
__label__SPOCK That sounds like a painful reality.
__label__SPOCK As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off. 
__label__SPOCK Nonetheless, it is too pure. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers. 
__label__SPOCK No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species. 
__label__SPOCK My friend does not understand. 
__label__SPOCK Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself. 
__label__SPOCK Energise. Reverse. 
__label__SPOCK I just did, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan.
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level. 
__label__SPOCK Speculate? No. Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which sent out the cube.
__label__SPOCK Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system. 
__label__SPOCK I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units. 
__label__SPOCK What is your destination? 
__label__SPOCK No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive. 
__label__SPOCK The translator is for use with more congruent life forms. 
__label__SPOCK It is a very real threat. In two standard years, the existing Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors. 
__label__SPOCK There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion. 
__label__SPOCK Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable. 
__label__SPOCK Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse.
__label__SPOCK I am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates. 
__label__SPOCK It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of that. 
__label__SPOCK Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four. 
__label__SPOCK Why would he put a bag on our captain? 
__label__SPOCK Really? 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and make repairs. 
__label__SPOCK Its skeleton is similar to that of a Denebian whale, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK Any problems, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us. Specifically, our future. 
__label__SPOCK The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man. 
__label__SPOCK Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Queen to king's level one.
__label__SPOCK Very bad poetry, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I deeply respect what he has accomplished. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect. 
__label__SPOCK Had I not touched them, I would have agreed with you, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment. 
__label__SPOCK So it would seem. Captain. 
__label__SPOCK As commanding officer, the choice will be mine. 
__label__SPOCK Request you come to the Bridge, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain  [Romulan ship]
__label__SPOCK Captain, impulses that direction. Very weak, possibly a survivor.
__label__SPOCK There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only one way to really experience it. 
__label__SPOCK That would be illogical, Miss Chapel. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK We shall soon see, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK We have a witness in McCoy's behalf. You must trust me. 
__label__SPOCK Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward Gamma Canaris region. 
__label__SPOCK There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find particularly interesting. 
__label__SPOCK My world is next for us. Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you call Medusans. I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship. 
__label__SPOCK There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here is the mother of her race. 
__label__SPOCK I have never slumped in my life, Captain, but I was about to ask you the same  BRIEL [OC]: Security! Anyone, please! Mess Officer Briel requesting help in the Main Dining Room. Tables, chairs, silverware, everything seems to have enlarged. Women losing rings, hairpins. Some are near panic. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided.
__label__SPOCK I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison. 
__label__SPOCK We seem to frighten the smaller ones. Some, the females, I believe, find us quite ugly. 
__label__SPOCK It is the usual end of a decaying orbit. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster than warp six? 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure. 
__label__SPOCK Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere? 
__label__SPOCK Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for maximum power generation. Compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors may be operating. 
__label__SPOCK When the struggle came which devastated your planet  KIRK: Only the best minds were chosen to survive. Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed. Henoch, from the other side. Realising our mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides. We built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room  STONE: Mister Spock, the court has not yet reached a verdict. We will hear this witness out. 
__label__SPOCK Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss.
__label__SPOCK Affirmative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK So it would seem. 
__label__SPOCK Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door. 
__label__SPOCK Why are you endangering your lives by coming here? 
__label__SPOCK You wouldn't give me a chance. You realise, Doctor, if you go, and fail to find an antidote, you too will die. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing here which would indicate this is anything but a planet.
__label__SPOCK I presume you mean they vanished in a manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics. 
__label__SPOCK After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction. 
__label__SPOCK Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this direction. 
__label__SPOCK Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system is M two four alpha. 
__label__SPOCK He's past us again. Damage to number four shield. 
__label__SPOCK In here, Captain. (at door to main room) 
__label__SPOCK In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him, but actually an annoyance. 
__label__SPOCK Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical decisions. And yet two men have died. 
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds, and there's no need to check your records.
__label__SPOCK It appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members of the crew. 
__label__SPOCK We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach. 
__label__SPOCK Not until my order. 
__label__SPOCK Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms. 
__label__SPOCK I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them? 
__label__SPOCK Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. 
__label__SPOCK Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name. SS Botany Bay. 
__label__SPOCK Already standing by.
__label__SPOCK I believe they were never actually present, Doctor. It was a mirage. 
__label__SPOCK Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the logic of history. 
__label__SPOCK Back where? 
__label__SPOCK All systems report normal, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable, occasionally brilliant. 
__label__SPOCK (handing the girl over to Sulu) Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for.
__label__SPOCK Very clear, Captain.
__label__SPOCK I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down. 
__label__SPOCK The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take command.
__label__SPOCK We were becoming concerned, Captain. Your check-in was overdue and since we'd not heard from your security team  KIRK [OC]: No problem, Mister Spock. Bear with me.
__label__SPOCK Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Insufficient data. I shall try to take further sensor readings. 
__label__SPOCK How much longer, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
__label__SPOCK Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel. 
__label__SPOCK We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator.
__label__SPOCK It is attempting to generate terror, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK No evidence of life, subspace interference level incredibly high. 
__label__SPOCK We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your old-style measurements. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Lexington hit again. 
__label__SPOCK Charting scanners on, Captain. Beginning science survey. 
__label__SPOCK The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action. 
__label__SPOCK The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us.
__label__SPOCK Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir. 
__label__SPOCK They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be more a sensation of feeling it. 
__label__SPOCK I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you. 
__label__SPOCK At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK The trial may be academic. 
__label__SPOCK It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their twentieth century. 
__label__SPOCK The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter. I should advise caution. 
__label__SPOCK The renowned Tholian punctuality. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull. 
__label__SPOCK Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is ours. It can be a successful one. 
__label__SPOCK We will notify her as soon as we've verified your credentials, Mister Winston. If you have your identity tapes with you  MCCOY: Spock! Of all the cold-blooded, inhospitable requests I've ever heard. 
__label__SPOCK There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.
__label__SPOCK Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind fusion? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents.
__label__SPOCK Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer. 
__label__SPOCK This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere. Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack. 
__label__SPOCK (returns from investigating) Nothing there. 
__label__SPOCK That was not the total conversion beam setting. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy. 
__label__SPOCK This is not Nancy. (hitting her repeatedly) If she were Nancy, could she take this? 
__label__SPOCK Can we know his range is, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole. 
__label__SPOCK It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square. 
__label__SPOCK (handing over a computer disc) M-5's readout, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You don't mind if we continue to try? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I just read some fresh signs. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. 
__label__SPOCK Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism? 
__label__SPOCK I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than  GARROVICK: Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here  SPOCK: Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio. (suddenly stops and sniffs) Do you smell something? 
__label__SPOCK Of course. Your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I found this device on my console. It seems to serve no useful function, and  (When he lifts his face from the eye pieces, of course there are rings around his eyes and laughter from the crew) 
__label__SPOCK Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again. 
__label__SPOCK I am honoured, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Growing. We can take only a few more seconds of this.
__label__SPOCK It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature. 
__label__SPOCK Has such an order ever included his senior officers? 
__label__SPOCK Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More likely a loose association of some sort. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly, sir. It seems they were where we are some tens of thousands of centuries ago. Their centuries, not ours. 
__label__SPOCK Trick or treat, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant McGivers. 
__label__SPOCK Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me. 
__label__SPOCK What were you saying? 
__label__SPOCK This is how history went after McCoy changed it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War.
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. What did you want? 
__label__SPOCK What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders. 
__label__SPOCK Feel that something else is necessary.
__label__SPOCK How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier. 
__label__SPOCK I am aware of that. 
__label__SPOCK Understood. 
__label__SPOCK That irregularly shaped object at the top of the core emanates considerable electrical activity. 
__label__SPOCK An alternate course of action would appear to be advisable. 
__label__SPOCK So one might assume, Mister Spock. 
__label__SPOCK By understanding every life comes to an end when time demands it. Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted.
__label__SPOCK Yes. I shall tend to it, Major. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti? 
__label__SPOCK Alien detected in the engineering section, near reactor number three. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Spock. I am Spock. 
__label__SPOCK I could phaser you out. 
__label__SPOCK No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan. 
__label__SPOCK Seven hours and eight minutes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit. 
__label__SPOCK (wiping away her tears) You couldn't pronounce it. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, leaving only the children. 
__label__SPOCK That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister Scott. Fuel status? 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Its hull is pure neutronium. There is no known way of blasting through it. 
__label__SPOCK It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile. 
__label__SPOCK I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin? 
__label__SPOCK We won't be able to break it, Captain. I'll phaser off a specimen. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation. 
__label__SPOCK I have a question for the doctor. (Kirk leaves) Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees, which is at least tolerable. However, I  MCCOY: Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, your condition. 
__label__SPOCK I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a picture of their Bridge. 
__label__SPOCK Where's Doctor McCoy? 
__label__SPOCK It is a device with feeding circuits. They lead into the mind of the priestess leader. Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders. 
__label__SPOCK According to this, Doctor McCoy was responsible for a plague which ravaged the planet Dramia Two some nineteen years ago, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here. 
__label__SPOCK Jim! 
__label__SPOCK It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a rock) He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out.
__label__SPOCK Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio. 
__label__SPOCK How is the doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Chekov is involved, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I would assume that. 
__label__SPOCK Your move, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device? 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. It would make us appear too weak.
__label__SPOCK Captain, these are crude crystals. There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow. 
__label__SPOCK They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen. 
__label__SPOCK In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet. 
__label__SPOCK Same as the alien, Captain.
__label__SPOCK They're studying us, for the moment. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless, anticipating that she would deny you admittance. However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me. 
__label__SPOCK Most curious, Captain. There appear to be more life-energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise crew plus the Klingons. A considerable discrepancy. 
__label__SPOCK To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility. 
__label__SPOCK An equally good possibility is that ship's personnel have contracted, and may be continuing to shrink. 
__label__SPOCK Unquestionably. 
__label__SPOCK I can continue in this body for several hours. 
__label__SPOCK Live long and prosper, Mister Seven. 
__label__SPOCK Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means reversing course. 
__label__SPOCK Standing by, Number One.
__label__SPOCK Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us. 
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy. If you will grant permission  HODIN [on viewscreen]: Of course, we shall institute a thorough search.
__label__SPOCK I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity. 
__label__SPOCK Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK I must take the ship.
__label__SPOCK What about the Captain? 
__label__SPOCK To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory. 
__label__SPOCK A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It is not outside the realm of probability. If he could rearrange his own atoms to become an examination table, one would have to assume he could become a deflector shield. 
__label__SPOCK It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays.
__label__SPOCK It is the Borgia variety, Captain. Could not have caused Darnell's death. 
__label__SPOCK The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is unquestionably controlling it. 
__label__SPOCK Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem the assumption was premature. 
__label__SPOCK True. I shall reconsider. 
__label__SPOCK Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel. 
__label__SPOCK We have discovered what he is, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK If I may explain, Captain. She refers to the tape storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place. I scan it. A most impressive store. 
__label__SPOCK That is quite logical, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Better rig a by-pass circuit. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own antidote. 
__label__SPOCK As with a number of discoveries, purely by accident, Lieutenant.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn. 
__label__SPOCK Are you all right? 
__label__SPOCK Truth. You do not desire to consume other beings. It would be best if you return to your origin. The way you came. Will you do this? 
__label__SPOCK All hands to your stations. This is a general alert.
__label__SPOCK You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
__label__SPOCK Then I'm unable to discern your problem. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot tell you at this time, sir.
__label__SPOCK Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch.
__label__SPOCK You can't stay. 
__label__SPOCK The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, I'm sure there has been a mistake. (hands on shoulders) Where are you supposed to be working? 
__label__SPOCK I am open to suggestions, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder. 
__label__SPOCK McCoy. McCoy, wake up. 
__label__SPOCK (singing) Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be watchful of young men in their velvet prime. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__SPOCK At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers. Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress call. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy.
__label__SPOCK Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion. 
__label__SPOCK Useless, Captain. A projection. 
__label__SPOCK Quite clear, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Logically, you should all be dead. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, there are always alternatives. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK He won't get far in there. 
__label__SPOCK Strange. We did no damage, but the Romulan is retreating anyway.
__label__SPOCK No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Within you. 
__label__SPOCK Very well, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Be careful. I would not want you to drop it. 
__label__SPOCK I'm trying, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be intact. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. Proceed, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, and where is the captain?
__label__SPOCK It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them. 
__label__SPOCK Ready. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now. 
__label__SPOCK I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a game. 
__label__SPOCK Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me. 
__label__SPOCK This is the Enterprise. I must speak with the Supreme Prefect. 
__label__SPOCK Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear.
__label__SPOCK Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult. 
__label__SPOCK The Earth buffalo. What about it? 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as these people do, to protect themselves. 
__label__SPOCK Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it.
__label__SPOCK Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed. 
__label__SPOCK We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us. Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember  KIRK: He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death. 
__label__SPOCK Attempting to remedy. 
__label__SPOCK The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks. 
__label__SPOCK You did. 
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain. 
__label__SPOCK Perfect working condition. 
__label__SPOCK Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which. 
__label__SPOCK And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.
__label__SPOCK I could make a device to deliver it on target. 
__label__SPOCK With no past, no future. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Not large enough even for a lifeboat. 
__label__SPOCK We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy? 
__label__SPOCK Instructions clear. I shall carry them out immediately. Spock out. 
__label__SPOCK Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference. 
__label__SPOCK If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer. 
__label__SPOCK Take charge of him. 
__label__SPOCK I'm making a suggestion. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we must get off this bridge. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps it did not understand. 
__label__SPOCK I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise, Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK I am not insensitive to it, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. Holding steady. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated. 
__label__SPOCK They seem to think you made the child disappear. They did not know we were a deadly species, capable of injuring one of them. 
__label__SPOCK Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder. 
__label__SPOCK If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him could be dangerous. 
__label__SPOCK I register no life readings at all, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. 
__label__SPOCK Nomad? 
__label__SPOCK Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own. 
__label__SPOCK The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key. 
__label__SPOCK Stand by to signal the captain. 
__label__SPOCK Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is seeking revenge? 
__label__SPOCK The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the first step. They've learned to kill. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with practically anything. 
__label__SPOCK I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable. 
__label__SPOCK It appears so. 
__label__SPOCK Bearing one one seven mark four. 
__label__SPOCK The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet. 
__label__SPOCK My impression is that they are laughing at me. 
__label__SPOCK Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir. We're on impulse power only. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you.
__label__SPOCK Captain, Jim, please don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the transmission.
__label__SPOCK None at all, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Correct, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK A magnetic probe. 
__label__SPOCK Warp drive out. Deflector shields down. Transporter under repair. We are on emergency impulse power. 
__label__SPOCK The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. Ready to leave orbit, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited? 
__label__SPOCK Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us. 
__label__SPOCK Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power. 
__label__SPOCK Why, thank you, Captain McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong erratic electrical impulses. 
__label__SPOCK Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind. 
__label__SPOCK Assuming it's a spy weapon then, the Slavers would have wanted to keep it a secret weapon. If so, it is logical to assume it has a self-destruct setting too. 
__label__SPOCK When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans will be stopped here. 
__label__SPOCK I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others.
__label__SPOCK Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes.
__label__SPOCK We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background radiation. 
__label__SPOCK I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer. 
__label__SPOCK Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK She is the source. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did. 
__label__SPOCK I wish to visit the planet Vulcan, thirty years past, the month of Tasmeen. Location, near the city of ShirKahr. 
__label__SPOCK It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. 
__label__SPOCK Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. 
__label__SPOCK I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been effective. 
__label__SPOCK You've found the antidote, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK The termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent outbreak of plague could have been coincidence, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is? 
__label__SPOCK I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship. 
__label__SPOCK Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain. 
__label__SPOCK Eighteen minutes thirty seven seconds in real time. But long before that we shall all be children. And, Captain, that also means we are losing our knowledge at an alarming rate. It is possible we will soon be unable to operate the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth. 
__label__SPOCK Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two. 
__label__SPOCK How, Mister Boma? 
__label__SPOCK I understand the feeling, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us successfully develop Sherman's Planet. 
__label__SPOCK Compensate. 
__label__SPOCK Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness. 
__label__SPOCK This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned. 
__label__SPOCK Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference. 
__label__SPOCK I would say so. 
__label__SPOCK Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person.
__label__SPOCK Report, Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one.
__label__SPOCK I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job. Computer. 
__label__SPOCK To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical. 
__label__SPOCK With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind. 
__label__SPOCK Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased. 
__label__SPOCK Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S.S. Columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
__label__SPOCK You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All systems are go, but we're not moving. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. 
__label__SPOCK I shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur. They do not take place at regular intervals. 
__label__SPOCK Pain, Captain. And you, my dear? 
__label__SPOCK I do not want to injure you. 
__label__SPOCK I'm afraid I don't know, Captain. Its illogical behaviour precludes a logical solution. 
__label__SPOCK Allow me. 
__label__SPOCK On audio, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Spock out.
__label__SPOCK Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker. 
__label__SPOCK According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi.
__label__SPOCK Obviously, Captain. And I have some fascinating data on the organism. 
__label__SPOCK It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational stresses. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura is not in the general beam-down area. 
__label__SPOCK I asked them. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, are you all right? You sound tired.
__label__SPOCK I have a theory, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical means. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical alternative. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration? 
__label__SPOCK Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and they have six-inch fangs. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.
__label__SPOCK You take from those who do not know you. 
__label__SPOCK Don't you find that painful, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it. 
__label__SPOCK My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians. 
__label__SPOCK It's a class M planet, gravity Earth normal, atmosphere Earth normal. There is no previous information available except that which the survey ship logged before her crew left her. 
__label__SPOCK Unidentified. This is not a drill. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps. But then two Doctor McCoys just might bring the level of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels. 
__label__SPOCK I just realised that. 
__label__SPOCK True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it. 
__label__SPOCK Seventeen point nine, to be exact. 
__label__SPOCK Something wrong, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain. Quite large. 
__label__SPOCK It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be. 
__label__SPOCK Contact check, Captain. It has been over an hour since your last communication. 
__label__SPOCK Changed the course? 
__label__SPOCK I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor. I am merely pursuing the only logical course available to us.
__label__SPOCK What will you feel for him after we are gone? 
__label__SPOCK It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.
__label__SPOCK Probe will impact in seven point three seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Empty.
__label__SPOCK Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has completed its re-evaluation. 
__label__SPOCK (with a medical scanner) If the lock is magnetised, this may disrupt its field. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, it is. 
__label__SPOCK We're held in stasis, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK No. (looking at his shaking hand) We're not.
__label__SPOCK On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian.
__label__SPOCK Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek soup? 
__label__SPOCK Engineering, status report. Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Then what, Mister Boma? 
__label__SPOCK I'm in control of my emotions.
__label__SPOCK Contact them directly. 
__label__SPOCK A positional change. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Engine room, we need power!
__label__SPOCK There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation. 
__label__SPOCK I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. More some type of device.
__label__SPOCK The child was named Leonard James Akaar? 
__label__SPOCK The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only the mechanised sentinels. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive. 
__label__SPOCK Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously? 
__label__SPOCK It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me. (the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor) It wants this ship, but I am resisting. 
__label__SPOCK Did you say your planet, sir? 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor.
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets. 
__label__SPOCK Check. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk! 
__label__SPOCK The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan's.
__label__SPOCK May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant. 
__label__SPOCK Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, with your permission  KIRK: By all means. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I have completed the analysis of the target area.
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can be controlled. 
__label__SPOCK I have tried, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Jim, I don't understand. 
__label__SPOCK You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose KIRK: I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and that's the end of it. 
__label__SPOCK By all means, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. 
__label__SPOCK Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die. 
__label__SPOCK Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally happened.
__label__SPOCK Yes. I know of it, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed. 
__label__SPOCK That would seem to be in order. 
__label__SPOCK I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was momentary. It passed quickly. 
__label__SPOCK Three, two  APRIL: Hang on, we're going right into the heart of the nova. 
__label__SPOCK No. 
__label__SPOCK A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots. 
__label__SPOCK We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an official establishment. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem so. 
__label__SPOCK I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the Captain's status. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow. 
__label__SPOCK Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical. 
__label__SPOCK It's no use, Jim. There's no way out. 
__label__SPOCK More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately 1960. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to transporter room. 
__label__SPOCK The computer will project the point at which systems' switches and buttons will be beyond our ability to operate. 
__label__SPOCK About one hundred yards in that direction. But after an attack as thorough as this one KIRK: I'll risk it.
__label__SPOCK I heard, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It just disintegrated. Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK For it, Captain?
__label__SPOCK Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness. 
__label__SPOCK Very well. (runs the tape through his computer) 
__label__SPOCK Cross-circuiting to B. 
__label__SPOCK Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. Quite sure. 
__label__SPOCK How does one obtain the power? 
__label__SPOCK You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew. 
__label__SPOCK Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this expedition before we beamed down. I assure you that none of them were  (He is interrupted by the entrance of an old man and woman.
__label__SPOCK Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind? 
__label__SPOCK Should we separate? 
__label__SPOCK I've frequently had my doubts.
__label__SPOCK It was my duty, Spock. 
__label__SPOCK The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura. This may be crucial. In the presence of the Kzinti, do not say anything, do not do anything startling. Try to look harmless. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer. 
__label__SPOCK They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread. 
__label__SPOCK I acknowledge your expertise in the field of weapons, Mister Sulu, but I do not see how you can determine probable ownership. 
__label__SPOCK I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in a shuttle craft. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please. 
__label__SPOCK Are we at present capable of resisting? 
__label__SPOCK Come. 
__label__SPOCK Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor.
__label__SPOCK I register a disturbance, Captain. As if an impulse just passed through the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Leave, all of you. 
__label__SPOCK If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of duty. That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship. 
__label__SPOCK He's hardly fit to testify at the trial, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK May I remind you, we did not intend to fight. 
__label__SPOCK Bridge to Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK No. No, Vulcan is quite different. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet. 
__label__SPOCK Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly intelligent. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently, subatomic particles from that field have invaded our computer's circuits, much like bacteria infect living matter. As a result, the Enterprise is suffering the electronic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, ease off. 
__label__SPOCK We were successful. 
__label__SPOCK Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't.
__label__SPOCK We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit.
__label__SPOCK Bridge to Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK He simply could not believe his ears. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating, but quite impossible. 
__label__SPOCK Have you reversed controls? 
__label__SPOCK Captain. If I remember correctly, the oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp. 
__label__SPOCK Someone tried to poison him. 
__label__SPOCK The study of it would be of great use, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle. 
__label__SPOCK This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity. 
__label__SPOCK I told you to lift off! 
__label__SPOCK That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed. 
__label__SPOCK You exaggerate, Nurse. Kindly see that your medical summary is more precise. 
__label__SPOCK No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Chekov, resume heading eight eight three mark four one. 
__label__SPOCK No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. 
__label__SPOCK All sensor readings are at maximum calibration. 
__label__SPOCK We are not tourists here, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam down point. 
__label__SPOCK Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door. 
__label__SPOCK I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I understand how you must  KIRK: Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here. Your guess. 
__label__SPOCK It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar. 
__label__SPOCK I think it unlikely it is one of theirs. 
__label__SPOCK I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society. 
__label__SPOCK Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the first time in their lives. 
__label__SPOCK It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this. Inconsistent with this environment  KIRK: But not inconsistent with what we've seen. Security. 
__label__SPOCK I sensed it die. 
__label__SPOCK His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.
__label__SPOCK The crew's descendants may still be living, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary.
__label__SPOCK To us, perhaps, but to the computer? 
__label__SPOCK Without the other. 
__label__SPOCK Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction? 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering. 
__label__SPOCK That thought has occasionally crossed my mind. 
__label__SPOCK Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is pursing an independent course through this solar system. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children. 
__label__SPOCK Your face is wet. 
__label__SPOCK A Yang lance, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger  KIRK: Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Incredible as it may seem, these people have no idea they're living on a spaceship. 
__label__SPOCK The question is irrelevant. 
__label__SPOCK Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by.
__label__SPOCK Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you? 
__label__SPOCK As if they were in them when  KIRK: Exactly. When what? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu? 
__label__SPOCK It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are areas I simply cannot scan. 
__label__SPOCK About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked. 
__label__SPOCK Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
__label__SPOCK Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Captain! 
__label__SPOCK How is he, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK I'm weak, Captain, but not in difficulty. 
__label__SPOCK Captain!
__label__SPOCK Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite gas! 
__label__SPOCK At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost, but I've run checks on all the instrumentation. All the equipment is functioning perfectly. 
__label__SPOCK I think not. Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK A fraud. But sold for enough credits to get to Sirius Nine. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times. 
__label__SPOCK Very archaic type, Captain. Sub light speed. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence. 
__label__SPOCK Spores? 
__label__SPOCK It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location. 
__label__SPOCK Sargon, would it harm you if I  SARGON: You may use your tricorder, Mister Spock. Your readings will show energy but no substance. Sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind. 
__label__SPOCK The attack was thorough. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK It could cure or kill, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK M-5 has identified her, Captain. The Woden. Listed in Starfleet Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation. No crew. Coming into visual range. 
__label__SPOCK Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way.
__label__SPOCK Captain Christopher. 
__label__SPOCK They are beings. Alive, like you. They will all die if you consume that thing. 
__label__SPOCK That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests. 
__label__SPOCK Psychiatric file, personality quotients. 
__label__SPOCK This is the best I could do in rigging so small a communicator, sir. 
__label__SPOCK I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room. 
__label__SPOCK Very good. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney. 
__label__SPOCK Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
__label__SPOCK This is Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements. 
__label__SPOCK It is quite possible, Captain, that they find us grotesque and ugly. And many people fear beings different from themselves. 
__label__SPOCK There is no sure way to guard our thoughts from him. Mister Sulu, he is not likely to deal with me or Lieutenant Uhura. She and I are inferior beings to them. But the Kzinti are meat eaters. If you sense him reading your mind, think of eating a raw vegetable. 
__label__SPOCK Cry? 
__label__SPOCK Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three five. 
__label__SPOCK Ready, Mister Sulu? 
__label__SPOCK It is no myth. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Ensign. 
__label__SPOCK No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him. 
__label__SPOCK Do you know whether he saw the Medusan? 
__label__SPOCK There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand. 
__label__SPOCK Energise. 
__label__SPOCK Did anyone else? 
__label__SPOCK Precisely, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Verbose, isn't he? 
__label__SPOCK Empty.
__label__SPOCK Report on the death of the transporter officer. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I am constrained to point out that since minds are evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true. 
__label__SPOCK Closing, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely. 
__label__SPOCK Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from below us. Under cloud cover and closing. 
__label__SPOCK Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat. 
__label__SPOCK Rate of compaction seems constant.
__label__SPOCK You made the desert crossing most efficiently. You will not disappoint Sarek in your kahs-wan. 
__label__SPOCK I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor Kahn the Tyrant. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead. 
__label__SPOCK Bridge to transporter room. 
__label__SPOCK State your name for the record. 
__label__SPOCK Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known. 
__label__SPOCK Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support. 
__label__SPOCK And now. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcan. 
__label__SPOCK The desperation of the science ship's first landing party is now obvious. 
__label__SPOCK Undetermined. Whatever it is, it's blocking our way. When we move, it moves as well.
__label__SPOCK One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred  KIRK: Never mind. But thanks. Kaplan, take the post. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides come down.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my behalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success. Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since  KIRK: Eighteen hours and twelve minutes. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child. 
__label__SPOCK The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline. I presume you've ordered full duration. 
__label__SPOCK Automatic bridge defence system on and prepared, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Most peculiar. 
__label__SPOCK Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you. 
__label__SPOCK Three hours, thirteen minutes. 
__label__SPOCK Speculation. Gifted insight. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, transporter operational, but just barely. 
__label__SPOCK It must work, Doctor. It is logical here. Power of this universe, enter my being. I know I can. I believe I can. 
__label__SPOCK Warp one in six seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. 
__label__SPOCK It is obvious they can pick up specific thought transmissions from us if they care to go to the trouble. I suggest that one of our number appear to be ill. The rest will put strong thoughts in our minds that a communicator is needed for recovery. 
__label__SPOCK II beg your pardon, sir? 
__label__SPOCK What is it, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Passing outer planet, Zeon. 
__label__SPOCK A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain, I am still here. Have you returned to the Enterprise? 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning. 
__label__SPOCK I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever  (But McCoy has woken up, and dashes towards the Guardian.) 
__label__SPOCK Officer posted, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we've been given on this culture. 
__label__SPOCK High rank probabilities, Captain. It is a magnetic organism without mass, but capable of symbiotic relationship with a host body, a starship for instance. It is a form of primal energy, and it can utilise the electronic control systems of a starship like the mind of a man uses the neural control systems of the human body. It has become the Enterprise, and we are only life-support organisms in its body like the white corpuscles in human blood. And Captain, the magnetic flux readings are higher. It is growing stronger, building itself. 
__label__SPOCK An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties. 
__label__SPOCK This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark.
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me. 
__label__SPOCK I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere. 
__label__SPOCK We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it for days. 
__label__SPOCK But this is painless. 
__label__SPOCK The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that. 
__label__SPOCK I am another being. 
__label__SPOCK Are you injured, Miss Chapel? 
__label__SPOCK I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost human pattern. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar. 
__label__SPOCK I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way. 
__label__SPOCK Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
__label__SPOCK He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all. 
__label__SPOCK Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power. 
__label__SPOCK Our ghost has materialised. 
__label__SPOCK We are up to warp twenty two and increasing, Captain. We shall have forty two point eight five seconds to correct our course after the alien ship enters the nova. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary. But  KIRK: But these people shouldn't be alive. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.
__label__SPOCK No, sir. We're being watched. 
__label__SPOCK A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now. 
__label__SPOCK Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet. 
__label__SPOCK Are you all right, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand the medical mind? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room. 
__label__SPOCK She sounds rational enough, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This appears to be an archive or library of some kind. 
__label__SPOCK Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless. 
__label__SPOCK Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew.
__label__SPOCK There is enough loose rock and shale. 
__label__SPOCK Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year. 
__label__SPOCK Go, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Why do you ask? 
__label__SPOCK Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not entirely successful. 
__label__SPOCK Prisoners? 
__label__SPOCK Andorians are not known for their charity. 
__label__SPOCK It will take me a moment to prepare. 
__label__SPOCK We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles. 
__label__SPOCK My opinion, Mister Boma. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer? 
__label__SPOCK Orders, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones. 
__label__SPOCK We cannot reverse our mutations without the serum, nor can the Aquans benefit from the knowledge of their ancestors. 
__label__SPOCK An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely. They were brutal, savage, unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity. I found them quite refreshing. 
__label__SPOCK No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic?
__label__SPOCK Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it was a mirage. 
__label__SPOCK If the energy stays at that level. 
__label__SPOCK And now to the business at hand. With your permission, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, what is our present position? 
__label__SPOCK We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero. SPOCK: There is, of course, a logical alternative. Kang's wife is, after all, our prisoner. Perhaps a threat. 
__label__SPOCK Emergency channel D.
__label__SPOCK In that case, Captain, I would suggest we apply forward thrust. 
__label__SPOCK Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the distress signal is automated. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here. 
__label__SPOCK Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour particles. 
__label__SPOCK That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home is a planet millions of light years away. 
__label__SPOCK The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us.
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Captain. (draws a phaser) We're now armed. I presume we shall try to reach the control room. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven. 
__label__SPOCK But we cannot expect their co-operation. They have refused the Empire. Command procedure dictates that we provide the customary example. 
__label__SPOCK I don't doubt your word. 
__label__SPOCK I demand the Right of Statement first. 
__label__SPOCK That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. 
__label__SPOCK I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room. His men have control of the ship. 
__label__SPOCK He may think we're destroyed, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, We finished ahead of schedule. 
__label__SPOCK Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane.
__label__SPOCK Captain, the transporter retains a memory of the body's molecular structure. Will it apply as well to your present height? 
__label__SPOCK If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render them harmless with reasonable rapidity. 
__label__SPOCK Commissioner Hedford was dying. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety. 
__label__SPOCK The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also regulate body growth. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Pike, may I remain for a moment? (flash, the others leave) You know why I've come, Captain. It's only six days away at maximum warp and I have it well-planned. (flash, flash) I have never disobeyed your orders before, Captain, but this time I must. (flash, flash)
__label__SPOCK Attention. The following personnel report to transporter room. Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge. 
__label__SPOCK Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now there you have a museum piece, Doctor. (referring to microscope) Lens type, manually operated, light-activated. 
__label__SPOCK Have you tried to communicate? 
__label__SPOCK That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods. 
__label__SPOCK I'm all right, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please.
__label__SPOCK Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis. 
__label__SPOCK And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you.
__label__SPOCK No information on that as yet, sir. I do have one read-out on full spiroid wave analysis. That will take approximately eight years. 
__label__SPOCK Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there. 
__label__SPOCK Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions. 
__label__SPOCK There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative energy. 
__label__SPOCK It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody. 
__label__SPOCK Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity. 
__label__SPOCK Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were a human. 
__label__SPOCK I am inclined to agree with the Doctor, Captain. The mass of the planet Alondra has been steadily growing smaller since we've been in here. 
__label__SPOCK Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us on in the same direction. 
__label__SPOCK In the family, all is silence. No more will be said of it. Live long and prosper, Sarek of Vulcan. 
__label__SPOCK The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.
__label__SPOCK All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.
__label__SPOCK There will be other opportunities, Mister Markel. I have just received their final telepathic message. 
__label__SPOCK Times change, Doctor. Times change.  
__label__SPOCK Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course. 
__label__SPOCK This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence number two, code one, one A, two B. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one.  
__label__SPOCK I am very flattered, Commander. There's no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise.
__label__SPOCK Interesting, Captain. Passers-by are carrying, I believe, firearms. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use. 
__label__SPOCK Young man  BOY: You going to hit Krako out here? You open up and you'll be scragged from every window in the street. I can fix it for ya. 
__label__SPOCK Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting.
__label__SPOCK Do you want me to beam up a party? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I compliment you on a wise decision. 
__label__SPOCK Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!
__label__SPOCK Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt, pitted. 
__label__SPOCK I can see the Captain is going to be difficult. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. 
__label__SPOCK The so-called girl is a Rigelian hypnoid, projecting a simple illusion. 
__label__SPOCK Power out on all but key levels, Captain. High magnetic flux reading. 
__label__SPOCK My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
__label__SPOCK I've neutralised the heating elements. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received. 
__label__SPOCK We know very little about them. Their civilisation is advanced. They've had space flight for several centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system.
__label__SPOCK You're certain you recognise his voice? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, of course. The entire landing party.
__label__SPOCK You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other. 
__label__SPOCK It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem able to maintain our distance. 
__label__SPOCK Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Their military capability, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet. Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I would suggest  KIRK: No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two  SPOCK: Gamma Hydra Four, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible. He too is stricken. 
__label__SPOCK Radiation at the tolerance level.
__label__SPOCK I too must make my farewells. Your hospitality has been most kind, but I must journey on. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus. 
__label__SPOCK I believe it's time to move on. 
__label__SPOCK We are attempting to end it, Doctor. By reason, preferably.
__label__SPOCK That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death. 
__label__SPOCK Your movements awakened me. 
__label__SPOCK Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage. 
__label__SPOCK I cut the transporter power. It was necessary to delay your beam-out until I could arrive. Take him. 
__label__SPOCK The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen. 
__label__SPOCK Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse engines. She's still maneuverable on warp drive. 
__label__SPOCK Activate. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors have picked up a Klingon ship, closing fast. 
__label__SPOCK Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter. 
__label__SPOCK Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary. 
__label__SPOCK It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK No. You see, the crisis was upon us, and then passed so quickly, Captain, that we  KIRK: Good. Good. Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities to test those orders which you never heard. Ahead warp factor two, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. 
__label__SPOCK You're going back down with the command pack? 
__label__SPOCK His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared. 
__label__SPOCK If he should try to stop us  KIRK: Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I think he knows that. 
__label__SPOCK (stroking a tribble) A most curious creature, Captain. Its trilling seems to have a tranquillising effect on the human nervous system. Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect. 
__label__SPOCK The Klingon seems to be veering off. My mistake, Captain. They were not veering off. They were attacking the grain ship. 
__label__SPOCK Concerning the situation you related to us.
__label__SPOCK It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric. 
__label__SPOCK Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here. 
__label__SPOCK Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Boma, we're working against time. 
__label__SPOCK Speed is essential, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated Mister Chekov's plan. I should regret your death. 
__label__SPOCK Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The situation forces me to do so, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll scan for them on the planet's surface. Spock out. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Energy output zero. Radiation level normal. 
__label__SPOCK Any past offenses, Mister Mudd? 
__label__SPOCK Binary sun with a Class M planet. That's rare enough to warrant investigation. 
__label__SPOCK (close to tears) I'm in control of my emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty.
__label__SPOCK Unbelievable, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty, there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience to duty. 
__label__SPOCK This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her being decorated. 
__label__SPOCK Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable. 
__label__SPOCK I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, you are a man of curious habits, but I have never known you to nap on the laboratory floor. 
__label__SPOCK Presumably the same way she got on. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously, it intends to intercept us. It has made several course changes corresponding with our own. 
__label__SPOCK No, he's not. 
__label__SPOCK Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence of massive circulatory collapse. 
__label__SPOCK No. Not with my Christine. 
__label__SPOCK An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste.
__label__SPOCK In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. 
__label__SPOCK I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity? 
__label__SPOCK If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise, come in. 
__label__SPOCK Please do not take your eyes off of it. Lieutenant Rahda, arm the pod jettison system. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development. 
__label__SPOCK Mankind, ready to kill. 
__label__SPOCK I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.
__label__SPOCK Obviously. 
__label__SPOCK No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Helm does not answer, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Theoretically it already has happened, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK I shall be delighted, Captain.  
__label__SPOCK No. I would say approximately four hundred  MCCOY: Don't quote odds and don't give me anymore dispassionate logic, Mister Spock. Just keep looking for them. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet  KIRK: Like Lazarus. Identical. Like both Lazarus', only one is matter and the other antimatter. If they meet. 
__label__SPOCK I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third course. 
__label__SPOCK I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured.
__label__SPOCK Elusive, Captain. I am investigating. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. 
__label__SPOCK I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. I am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster of ships ahead of us. 
__label__SPOCK Explain. 
__label__SPOCK Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim. 
__label__SPOCK An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment. 
__label__SPOCK It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel. 
__label__SPOCK No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit.
__label__SPOCK The probe originates in this wall, as does an incredibly powerful force shield. It appears to be an amalgam of devices designed to defend and protect the city and this building in particular. 
__label__SPOCK I endeavour to be accurate. 
__label__SPOCK I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared. 
__label__SPOCK There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.
__label__SPOCK Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude. 
__label__SPOCK I'll accompany you, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim jurisdiction. 
__label__SPOCK The machine. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. (sedates it) 
__label__SPOCK Agreed.
__label__SPOCK Well, you have been derelict in your duties of late, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently Thelev did. 
__label__SPOCK And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries old. 
__label__SPOCK All engines stop. Hold position here. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, I respectfully decline.
__label__SPOCK Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact  [Auxiliary control]
__label__SPOCK Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root. 
__label__SPOCK Gem, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents. 
__label__SPOCK The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy. 
__label__SPOCK Goodnight, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move. 
__label__SPOCK Prepare to transport on the Captain's co-ordinates on my order. 
__label__SPOCK He's too young, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on the planet's surface, I should think. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived. 
__label__SPOCK On mark eight and closing. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, we seem to be suffering from some form of vertigo. 
__label__SPOCK That is a very good question. 
__label__SPOCK I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir.
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional reaction to it. 
__label__SPOCK Are they really? 
__label__SPOCK Reporting, sir. Sensors show it is solid, but its composition is unknown to us.
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking officer  KIRK: No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher. I order you to take command. 
__label__SPOCK That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have been recorded. They could have become known to you. 
__label__SPOCK Darling, are you all right? 
__label__SPOCK Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together?
__label__SPOCK Power approaching critical. They cannot continue. 
__label__SPOCK Results on DNA reduction limits have come through, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly! 
__label__SPOCK Captain, are you quite all right? 
__label__SPOCK Then your statement would not be considered valid. 
__label__SPOCK We wish only to save the life of the captain. 
__label__SPOCK There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?
__label__SPOCK I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no. 
__label__SPOCK Presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that operates the planetary effects. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H. 
__label__SPOCK That's true, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions. 
__label__SPOCK I have visual contact, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive. 
__label__SPOCK Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Is that too much to ask, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY I'll try, but I'll need tests and  SULU [OC]: Bridge to Captain. 
__label__MCCOY I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you got what you wanted. 
__label__MCCOY Schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway. 
__label__MCCOY I'll be happy to discuss that with you, Mister Spock, next time you drop in to my medical lab. 
__label__MCCOY T'Pau. Officiating at Spock's wedding? 
__label__MCCOY Please. Do not fight us like this, Doctor Jones. I appeal to you as a colleague. Do not oppose us. 
__label__MCCOY Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl? 
__label__MCCOY Yes? 
__label__MCCOY That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That might be a factor. 
__label__MCCOY This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. (makes Tonia stand with her back to a tree) I swear I heard someone moving around.
__label__MCCOY He's fully immunised now. We all are. 
__label__MCCOY You took a big chance they didn't start an autopsy. 
__label__MCCOY A what? 
__label__MCCOY Then again   [Bridge] 
__label__MCCOY Just like Compton.
__label__MCCOY What did he mean, we're not to give ourselves away? Can't they detect the ship up here? 
__label__MCCOY You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I should think work would be a better therapy. 
__label__MCCOY How long will that take? 
__label__MCCOY Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship. I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down. 
__label__MCCOY Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally? 
__label__MCCOY I intend to find out. I'll be in the medical record library. 
__label__MCCOY I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY He is dying. 
__label__MCCOY It's one of the things we've got to find out. We've got to take a closer look at it. 
__label__MCCOY She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for.
__label__MCCOY Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive. 
__label__MCCOY You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I think I've got it. All we have to do is quit feeding them. We quit feeding them, they stop breeding. 
__label__MCCOY I don't think he understands. His mind is still trying to assimilate all the knowledge it's been fed. 
__label__MCCOY One more like that, and I'm going to lose both these men.
__label__MCCOY The first thing we're going to do is get you back to the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Right forefinger. 
__label__MCCOY A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them out there, wherever they are. 
__label__MCCOY Or a communicator. It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY (to Wallace) Run this through, Doctor. 
__label__MCCOY Do the people know the contents of their book? 
__label__MCCOY Locks can be picked, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Being in one piece is very natural where we come from. 
__label__MCCOY Probably kill Jim and Spock. 
__label__MCCOY You still feel all right? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, if that's true, we're all in trouble. Jim, do something. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, we've been through it and through it. Radiation, heat  KIRK: But one other thing you haven't mentioned. It's bright. It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough. 
__label__MCCOY Well, if you're actually giving me a choice  KIRK: I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-Century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McIvers? 
__label__MCCOY Good luck, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY He'll die in seconds if we don't. 
__label__MCCOY Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be Crater? He came this way. 
__label__MCCOY It was a deep wound, Jim. He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover. 
__label__MCCOY She's not registering. 
__label__MCCOY You see what I mean?
__label__MCCOY There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which requires our presence. 
__label__MCCOY I'll let my record speak for me. 
__label__MCCOY You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient. 
__label__MCCOY You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because you found a discrepancy in a hydrogen cloud? 
__label__MCCOY The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered. 
__label__MCCOY Is that all that happened? 
__label__MCCOY What did you do? What did you do? 
__label__MCCOY If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere else. 
__label__MCCOY Easy now. Oh, he's caught it! 
__label__MCCOY But why? 
__label__MCCOY I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it. 
__label__MCCOY I know what you're saying, Jim, but if you go down on that planet and you die there  KIRK: Right now we have only two choices. Live in an aquarium somewhere for the rest of our lives or stay on Argo. I won't accept either one of them. 
__label__MCCOY I'm very sorry, but that's impossible. 
__label__MCCOY You are at your station, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla. 
__label__MCCOY He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him. 
__label__MCCOY Pleasure. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, didn't you hear? I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world. Jim, isn't it worth that risk? Wouldn't you insist upon taking such a risk yourself? 
__label__MCCOY We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do. We can't turn it on and off. 
__label__MCCOY Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other, till the last of us finally destroys himself. 
__label__MCCOY I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible. 
__label__MCCOY Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury.
__label__MCCOY Well done, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I'll never live this down. This Vulcan is telling me how to operate. 
__label__MCCOY Are you insane? 
__label__MCCOY Not good. Severe shock. 
__label__MCCOY Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to. But we find something. 
__label__MCCOY But we're strangers to each other. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, so you're the dentist. Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency. I wonder if you mind if I borrow a small quantity of this. 
__label__MCCOY Neither do I, but it has. How do I knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn't show any information on Platonius bacteria? All I can do, and this is going to take time, is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope. 
__label__MCCOY As long as any of us. Blast medicine anyway. We've learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out, and no one can reach in.
__label__MCCOY What coincidence? We used to pull stunts like this in medical school with trick glasses. Don't look now, but we've got a practical joker in our midst. 
__label__MCCOY If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he was in trouble. 
__label__MCCOY Well, well, what's happening? 
__label__MCCOY He's been poisoned. Unknown toxin. 
__label__MCCOY Agreed. Sterilite off. 
__label__MCCOY Normal? That thing's trying to tell us nothing has happened. 
__label__MCCOY Then why didn't you warn us? 
__label__MCCOY I think I read you, Jim, but as medical officer I must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children, you are treading dangerously. 
__label__MCCOY Did he seem to be getting hysterical? 
__label__MCCOY A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I can rig a test cubicle in the bio-lab, put our specimen in it. But I don't  KIRK: Good. Let's get on it. 
__label__MCCOY It's good to see you.
__label__MCCOY It's highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us. 
__label__MCCOY The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just declared Jim dead. 
__label__MCCOY He must have attention soon. 
__label__MCCOY He should be beamed aboard, Jim. He needs more than I can do for him here. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant, which seems to be quite a time saver. 
__label__MCCOY Of course you have, Uhura. We would all like to  UHURA: He's alive. He's alive, Doctor. 
__label__MCCOY No. 
__label__MCCOY Incredible. 
__label__MCCOY I know. I'm worried about Jim, too.
__label__MCCOY Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all the difference. 
__label__MCCOY The need was apparently desperate. 
__label__MCCOY Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is extremely sorry. 
__label__MCCOY Press the three lower planets on the left-hand side simultaneously. 
__label__MCCOY Yeah. That's right. That's just what it is. 
__label__MCCOY I hope not. Scotty has an idea. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous. I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work. 
__label__MCCOY How does that Vulcan salute go? 
__label__MCCOY What's happening to you, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY It's certainly worth a try. 
__label__MCCOY I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but  KIRK: Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war. Kirk to Bridge. 
__label__MCCOY Must you always be so blasted honest? 
__label__MCCOY Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him. 
__label__MCCOY I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems, no decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis. In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old, and I can't begin to tell you how old they are, twenty years or twenty thousand years. 
__label__MCCOY What about the Enterprise, Jim. Scotty could get worried. He could beam down a fighting force. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! (Kirk turns machine off) 
__label__MCCOY I'll have it ready before Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Assassins! Murderers! Murderers! Assassins! You! What planet is this? (he drops the bottle) No! Don't run! I won't kill you! It's they who do the killing! Don't run! I won't kill you! 
__label__MCCOY I think Mister Chekov's right. We are in a lot of trouble. 
__label__MCCOY You don't have to worry about that now, Jim. Look at the clock. 
__label__MCCOY You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried it, huh? 
__label__MCCOY Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories.
__label__MCCOY The ryetalyn. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. Jim! Jim. What's going on there? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY What do you want, signs pointing the way? 
__label__MCCOY He's dead, Jim.
__label__MCCOY (holding up a hypo) I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this. At least it'll give Kirk a fighting chance. 
__label__MCCOY He's dead. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. It's possible. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy. Chief medical officer. 
__label__MCCOY They seem completely secure and unafraid. 
__label__MCCOY (giving an injection) Jim, there is no antitoxin for this poison. I can only keep you alive a few hours with this. 
__label__MCCOY Prepare two ccs of stokaline. 
__label__MCCOY Don't move a muscle.
__label__MCCOY If something went wrong  CHRISTOPHER: Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him. 
__label__MCCOY A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body. It's only experimental. 
__label__MCCOY I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and peaceful culture. 
__label__MCCOY No, not yet. 
__label__MCCOY Sorry, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared. 
__label__MCCOY Can I help you, friend? 
__label__MCCOY Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant, do you mind if I take one of these down to the lab to see what makes it tick? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it? 
__label__MCCOY Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in under the wire. I've never seen anything like the speed of that robot.
__label__MCCOY That fast? 
__label__MCCOY Thank Mister Spock too. And Captain Kirk. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do, sit up here and wait for our supplies to run out, our power to die? It has to eventually, you know. We certainly can't go back to Earth. It would be worse than the Captain being returned. There are four hundred and thirty of us, and that means four hundred and thirty chances of altering the future. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, that was clear to me. 
__label__MCCOY No, Jim. You can't do it. 
__label__MCCOY Captain Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency. 
__label__MCCOY The emergency is real. I need these things. 
__label__MCCOY What is it, Spock?
__label__MCCOY But they weren't rivals in love. Jim, you shouldn't go in there.
__label__MCCOY Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad state. 
__label__MCCOY Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind. 
__label__MCCOY No, I think I can walk. I'll try. 
__label__MCCOY You'd better be careful. You're going to hurt somebody with that thing. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you? Archaeology, anthropology, ancient civilisations. 
__label__MCCOY Stimulants. I don't know how long we can keep this up. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. Of course. A child could do it. A child could do it.
__label__MCCOY Well, that's not too bad. Back to work, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive? 
__label__MCCOY I do? 
__label__MCCOY Unfortunately, he wasn't the first. 
__label__MCCOY A teddy bear. 
__label__MCCOY I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician. 
__label__MCCOY She will be. I'll stay here with her. The book is in the monolith. 
__label__MCCOY So you tested the programme bank. 
__label__MCCOY I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. Jackson Roykirk. 
__label__MCCOY I can understand why you think Keniclius is the master if he saved you from dying, but why do you agree with his plan of a super race? 
__label__MCCOY We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done. 
__label__MCCOY Neck snapped clean. 
__label__MCCOY That devours all life and light. 
__label__MCCOY He's coming out of it, Jim. He's becoming conscious and aware. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy out. 
__label__MCCOY The wounds were not that severe.
__label__MCCOY Yes, but, my dear, if he doesn't want you and he has asked you to forget him, then I suggest you take that as an honest concern for you and do it. Forget Winston. 
__label__MCCOY Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get back. 
__label__MCCOY But he's not that kind of a man. 
__label__MCCOY I think I left it in Bela's office. 
__label__MCCOY (looking at a medal) He was a hero in every sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing. The one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the Enterprise. Now you've made that impossible, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are? 
__label__MCCOY Well, Jaris is all right. 
__label__MCCOY For me? I've made my decision. I'm staying here, on Yonada.
__label__MCCOY What if something happens to Spock or the Master? 
__label__MCCOY Whatever gave you that idea? 
__label__MCCOY Occasional and teenage routine incidents. 
__label__MCCOY The strands wouldn't break, Jim, they'd just quit winding. 
__label__MCCOY One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on that planet. 
__label__MCCOY Enterprise! Emergency! Beam up! 
__label__MCCOY It's not necessary, Captain. It's very simple. Nothing can go wrong. 
__label__MCCOY He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity. He goes to meet Landru.
__label__MCCOY How? 
__label__MCCOY The body is in Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, can you hear us? 
__label__MCCOY Jim won't be able to get out of its path. 
__label__MCCOY Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY You think Jim suspects he's Kodos? 
__label__MCCOY That's why our weight remains the same, same number of atoms.
__label__MCCOY I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Spock. 
__label__MCCOY A little time, he'll live. 
__label__MCCOY Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Some krypton, argon, neon.
__label__MCCOY You can't go back there. You'll end up like the other two. 
__label__MCCOY Or maybe they want to see how our toys work. 
__label__MCCOY I had to confine my orderly to sickbay.
__label__MCCOY Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort? 
__label__MCCOY Captain, receiving a transporter signal. 
__label__MCCOY Are you out of your head? 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here, and quit explaining why we can't get out of here. 
__label__MCCOY Ride her through where? 
__label__MCCOY That must have been quite a talk you made down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business? 
__label__MCCOY Mister Boma. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse. 
__label__MCCOY Hey, what's going on here. 
__label__MCCOY Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything. 
__label__MCCOY He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him. 
__label__MCCOY Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb. 
__label__MCCOY That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints. 
__label__MCCOY Not good, Jim. I'll have to put a respirator on him to help him breathe soon. 
__label__MCCOY Well just remember they're highly sophisticated robots created by the planet computer to make your dreams come true. 
__label__MCCOY The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is a concentration of kironide, broken down by pituitary hormone. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what are you doing? 
__label__MCCOY Cyalodin. 
__label__MCCOY That's true. 
__label__MCCOY You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Did you find Mister Sulu?
__label__MCCOY My shoes are full of sand. 
__label__MCCOY I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact. 
__label__MCCOY That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat! 
__label__MCCOY Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can be shorted out? 
__label__MCCOY Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature. A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements? 
__label__MCCOY Jim and his creature? 
__label__MCCOY At least I have the good sense to be scared, Jim. What now? 
__label__MCCOY (into communicator) That's right, Lieutenant. Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I want it for. I just want it! Now move! 
__label__MCCOY I've just completed the standard physical examinations for the entire crew. 
__label__MCCOY Well, no. 
__label__MCCOY I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study that patient KIRK: You don't believe him, and you can't explain it. Bones, are you aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries? I've been to those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and they're not cages anymore.
__label__MCCOY Jim, I found something!
__label__MCCOY Lawgivers! (trying to strangle Kirk) Traitor! Traitors!
__label__MCCOY I'll be most effective on the job in the time left, if you'll keep this to yourself.
__label__MCCOY Can you contact them sooner? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you. 
__label__MCCOY Creature, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear? 
__label__MCCOY Just where are you going? 
__label__MCCOY I don't need textbooks to know you could've promoted him too fast. Listen to that voice.
__label__MCCOY That's the last time I waste my bedside manner on a Vulcan. 
__label__MCCOY There. Those filthy butchers. There are rules, even in war. You don't keep hacking at a man after he's down. Hand me that numanol capsule. 
__label__MCCOY She seems harmless enough. 
__label__MCCOY Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes?
__label__MCCOY Oh, Captain. Got a minute? 
__label__MCCOY Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath. Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination. 
__label__MCCOY He's got a good chance. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on. Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret? 
__label__MCCOY It's in mine from now on. 
__label__MCCOY Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up.
__label__MCCOY I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much.
__label__MCCOY How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life? Will we allow it, gentlemen? 
__label__MCCOY If you have any doubt, that was indeed Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, this man believes in the same thing we believe in. That killing is stupid and useless. 
__label__MCCOY Fine time to ring the dinner bell. 
__label__MCCOY Probably somebody discovered a hangnail. I'll beam up and let you know, Jim.
__label__MCCOY I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be.
__label__MCCOY When in doubt, the book prevails, Mister Spock. I've run tests.
__label__MCCOY The last slide I examined, I failed to make the necessary adjustment. The slowing down of my own responses  KIRK: Never mind that, what did you find? 
__label__MCCOY (offering a drink) Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I need Nurse Chapel. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, that Oracle really got to me. I must be especially susceptible to its magic spells. 
__label__MCCOY Absolutely not! As a matter of fact I was thinking how beautiful and peaceful everything was, and then suddenly this female started shouting 'Off with his head!'. My head. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too.
__label__MCCOY Incredible. 
__label__MCCOY If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million colonists on that planet down there, just as much your responsibility.
__label__MCCOY And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY You deliberately stopped me, Jim. I could have saved her. Do you know what you just did? 
__label__MCCOY Now it's up to the captain. 
__label__MCCOY Incredible. It is him. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated. 
__label__MCCOY Hello, friend. We were told to wait here. 
__label__MCCOY Is somebody injured? What happened? 
__label__MCCOY Well, we're certainly going to try. The infection is massive.
__label__MCCOY Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of. 
__label__MCCOY Then why did you fight the examination? 
__label__MCCOY We're going to Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY Hmm? 
__label__MCCOY The Zetars are growing stronger. 
__label__MCCOY There was a call for you from the Bridge. 
__label__MCCOY What girl? 
__label__MCCOY There's one possibility. The mass insanity may have reached this planet, too. 
__label__MCCOY Are you satisfied? Spock, why did you do it?
__label__MCCOY That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain. 
__label__MCCOY Your weight was up a couple of pounds, remember?
__label__MCCOY Spock? 
__label__MCCOY A plant? It moves. 
__label__MCCOY Put on your masks. 
__label__MCCOY Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face. 
__label__MCCOY It's his job, and you know it. 
__label__MCCOY Can dig out the information. 
__label__MCCOY Who's the governor of Mantilles, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY And my responsibility is the health of this crew. You've been driving yourself too hard, and I want you to get some rest. 
__label__MCCOY Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater? 
__label__MCCOY I'm ready. 
__label__MCCOY Let it go, Jim. He's dead. 
__label__MCCOY Millions. 
__label__MCCOY We all saw him. The Captain's still alive. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply.
__label__MCCOY What's that supposed to mean? If that was supposed to be a joke, Spock, I have to remind you Vulcans don't tell jokes. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. I can't read you very well. Is this Rodriguez?
__label__MCCOY I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them. 
__label__MCCOY But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not. 
__label__MCCOY She's dead, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed. 
__label__MCCOY Well, Mister Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll need a medical officer. 
__label__MCCOY Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet? 
__label__MCCOY You sound terrible. Wait there for me. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. This is senseless. I've thought it over. I'm staying. 
__label__MCCOY Starfleet's been trying for six months. If he's alive, isn't it unlikely that he'd receive us now? 
__label__MCCOY Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there. 
__label__MCCOY Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape. 
__label__MCCOY I doubt it. Not in his present condition. 
__label__MCCOY Sounds like a horror story. Suppose there's any truth in it? 
__label__MCCOY In the arm. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste. 
__label__MCCOY We got off! 
__label__MCCOY You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.
__label__MCCOY Jim. The Captain's neck is broken. 
__label__MCCOY I can have her ready in a few minutes. 
__label__MCCOY Where did it come from? 
__label__MCCOY Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I didn't realise how many of the tools I use in Sickbay were designed by Sarah. 
__label__MCCOY Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we furnish the provocation. 
__label__MCCOY When I get my hands on the clown who's behind all this, I'll put him in Sickbay for a week. 
__label__MCCOY Why, that scoundrel. 
__label__MCCOY Are you all right? 
__label__MCCOY One. A naturally occurring drug called strobolin. But it's only found on a few planets in the galaxy. 
__label__MCCOY Dead? 
__label__MCCOY You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of them around? 
__label__MCCOY Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it? 
__label__MCCOY He's dying. Something's happened to his brain. Electrical activity decreasing. 
__label__MCCOY He'll make it. He'll be stiff and sore for a while, but he'll be all right. 
__label__MCCOY He means it's cold. 
__label__MCCOY Leonard McCoy, ma'am. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell me. 
__label__MCCOY I do wish he could forget her. 
__label__MCCOY Oh yes I did. 
__label__MCCOY You have a point, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.
__label__MCCOY You have the goodness. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, and all because I said this place made me feel like Alice in Wonderland. 
__label__MCCOY Sho'nuf. Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh? 
__label__MCCOY Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known. 
__label__MCCOY My medical scanner. 
__label__MCCOY Right elbow. 
__label__MCCOY Don't worry. I can make it, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if what he's seeing is real or delusion SPOCK: It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives.
__label__MCCOY Same report.
__label__MCCOY Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us. Better in fact, because he's acclimated. 
__label__MCCOY It's crucial. 
__label__MCCOY What are you going to do to my friends? 
__label__MCCOY How long will it take you to reach this new world? 
__label__MCCOY Something's changed their whole lung structure. They can't live in the air anymore. 
__label__MCCOY We may be able to get these people back on course. 
__label__MCCOY It? 
__label__MCCOY Is it you, Jim? (a nod) Good, his metabolic rate is back to normal. 
__label__MCCOY Or a tragic mistake on my part. 
__label__MCCOY First time I ever admired a body function. 
__label__MCCOY What do we do now, go up and knock? 
__label__MCCOY Can we discuss it here? 
__label__MCCOY Come on, Spock, the passageway was there before. It's got to be there. 
__label__MCCOY It is lovely, but I'm more in the mood for a nice quiet walk in the woods. 
__label__MCCOY Somewhere. I'm not certain. 
__label__MCCOY It's a shame to have to intrude. 
__label__MCCOY If they're wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava  SCOTT: Then they're dead men. I couldna pull them back in time. 
__label__MCCOY Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able to patch together again? 
__label__MCCOY Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman. 
__label__MCCOY Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song? 
__label__MCCOY What do we do now, knock? 
__label__MCCOY It's all here. They haven't damaged it. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine. 
__label__MCCOY There's nothing disgusting about it. It's just another life form, that's all. You get used to those things. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse, would you mind, please? 
__label__MCCOY Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead! 
__label__MCCOY Never mind the chit-chat. I've got my medical scanners all set up for a Vulcan. I have to recalibrate every time I run a physical on you, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up. 
__label__MCCOY It'll take some doing, but it is possible. 
__label__MCCOY Dual respiratory system. Lungs and gills. 
__label__MCCOY Spock! It must be this space. It's getting to me too. I know it's nothing you've done, Spock. I, I'm sorry. 
__label__MCCOY Are you suggesting that they could have transported over a distance of? You're out of your Vulcan mind, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of that. 
__label__MCCOY I don't like it, Jim. Why only one short signal and no more? 
__label__MCCOY You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too. 
__label__MCCOY Look, Jim. I know what it means to you to lose a crewman. 
__label__MCCOY It looks right. 
__label__MCCOY There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans. 
__label__MCCOY You're a romantic, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY (noticing a curtained alcove) Harry, what's this? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability. 
__label__MCCOY Yeah, we can handle it, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Key to what? 
__label__MCCOY You tell him, buster. Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life! 
__label__MCCOY Who's Katie? 
__label__MCCOY No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed. 
__label__MCCOY Blasted Vulcan. Why couldn't you have red blood like any normal human? 
__label__MCCOY The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador. 
__label__MCCOY Collecting specimens.
__label__MCCOY I could have told you that without looking. 
__label__MCCOY Wait a minute. I don't quite follow you. 
__label__MCCOY Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I wouldn't suppose that Vulcan has legends like those? 
__label__MCCOY We found something. 
__label__MCCOY (coming in from rear compartment) This should save us at least fifty pounds, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, it's no use. You'll get nothing out of that one. Hers is the mind of a child. 
__label__MCCOY The same as our Ensign. 
__label__MCCOY The choice has been made. (to Gem) You stay here with my friends. They'll take care of you. Do you understand? 
__label__MCCOY You must know that's impossible. Starfleet regulations  CLAUDIUS: Are designed to circumvent any such order. There may be over four hundred men on your ship, Captain, but they can be brought down if it's handled properly. Say, a few at a time. You see, I have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible. Your communicator, Captain Kirk. Now do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders. 
__label__MCCOY I wouldn't believe the human organism could take such pain. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what's going on down there? 
__label__MCCOY After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting. 
__label__MCCOY Easy, easy. Nobodies going to  NANCY: But you must help me! 
__label__MCCOY Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead. 
__label__MCCOY He is hers? 
__label__MCCOY I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question. 
__label__MCCOY If they're all right, they should've reported in. 
__label__MCCOY We've seen the results of some of your tests. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, we've got to do something. 
__label__MCCOY Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt. You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you. Well, we were wrong. So were you. You made a command decision. Jim would have done the same. My prescription is rest, now.
__label__MCCOY Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this. 
__label__MCCOY Your instincts are still good, Mister Spock. The captain is dead.
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. Received and understood. 
__label__MCCOY Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome. It's particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains. 
__label__MCCOY I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting for? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I'm worried about Spock. He's just not acting normal. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, very lonely. 
__label__MCCOY Now wait a minute, you, you. Hey! 
__label__MCCOY Captain! 
__label__MCCOY I wonder where Jim is. 
__label__MCCOY Heart beat now approaching forty per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up. 
__label__MCCOY Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? (everyone else knows)
__label__MCCOY Jim? Are you all right? 
__label__MCCOY I shall be honoured, sir. 
__label__MCCOY You admit that? 
__label__MCCOY Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor. 
__label__MCCOY First, the Captain. Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY No, but you won't let that stop you.
__label__MCCOY These are the most beautiful women in the galaxy. But where are the men? 
__label__MCCOY I'm not finished yet. 
__label__MCCOY That'll be all. Thank you very much. 
__label__MCCOY I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.
__label__MCCOY A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to protect her.
__label__MCCOY It would be worse if he had company. 
__label__MCCOY You won't even know it happened. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you. 
__label__MCCOY There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth. 
__label__MCCOY Don't get dressed yet. 
__label__MCCOY I'm getting reports from every deck. Half the people on this ship just fainted. 
__label__MCCOY I want to thank you for saving his life. (Nona's hand is healed too) I would like to learn more about this. 
__label__MCCOY Tombstone. Hell for leather, right out of history. 
__label__MCCOY Worse. They're backed up into the corridor. 
__label__MCCOY Technically, no. Medically, yes. Between the stimulants and the pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes. 
__label__MCCOY It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way. 
__label__MCCOY He's got about one minute to live unless I can find an answer.
__label__MCCOY Jim, there's something about these tribbles. 
__label__MCCOY Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air? 
__label__MCCOY What about us? 
__label__MCCOY Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help. 
__label__MCCOY Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well. 
__label__MCCOY Scotty? Boma? 
__label__MCCOY Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it.
__label__MCCOY Well, Scotty, now you've done it. 
__label__MCCOY He's coming out of it now. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to stay. Why? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen before and may never see again. We could learn more in one day  SPOCK: We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left. 
__label__MCCOY Reversal of arterial and brain damage should begin almost immediately. 
__label__MCCOY Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you? 
__label__MCCOY I know it, Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY It's a disease, like a virus invading the body of our galaxy. 
__label__MCCOY We get them out. 
__label__MCCOY The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Their bodies are functioning. Metabolism, heart. Everything but the lungs. 
__label__MCCOY I can find no reason for the captain's behaviour, except possibly that we've been on patrol too long without relief and diversion. He has resisted all of my attempts to run a psychological profile on him. 
__label__MCCOY It's dead. It's incredible. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately. 
__label__MCCOY She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one. 
__label__MCCOY Aren't all our uniforms xenylon? 
__label__MCCOY Yeah, a little bit, I guess. You see, we walked out of each other's lives ten years ago. She married Crater, and for all I know she may have forgotten me completely. Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd I let myself in for things like this? 
__label__MCCOY Well, what are we waiting for, Mister Spock? We're not diplomats. 
__label__MCCOY I've examined nine men so far, varying in ages from twenty three to fifty nine. They're all in perfect condition. Text book responses.
__label__MCCOY Jim, you don't think that's going to help us? Whatever that thing is, it survived millennia in a dead hulk. All it has to do is outlast us and just take over. 
__label__MCCOY Somehow, I find transporting into the darkness unnerving. 
__label__MCCOY So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream. Body functions seem normal.
__label__MCCOY We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution.
__label__MCCOY And you being the very serious young  KIRK: Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door.
__label__MCCOY Jim, your brother Sam and his family, aren't they stationed on this planet?
__label__MCCOY I knew it had to happen. It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down. 
__label__MCCOY I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab. They're both in extreme pain.
__label__MCCOY Yes? 
__label__MCCOY Right now. 
__label__MCCOY Lawgivers! 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice. 
__label__MCCOY Spock is slipping away. There isn't much time left. 
__label__MCCOY Okay, whoever you are, so we fell for your juvenile joke. Now get us out. 
__label__MCCOY Thanks. The air was running out under there. 
__label__MCCOY Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time? 
__label__MCCOY Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done such a thing. 
__label__MCCOY Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating. 
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant Galway. 
__label__MCCOY Medical log, stardate 4211.8. Kirk is right about the people here. Despite their fear and our strangeness, they're compassionate and gentle. I've learned the hunter Tyree is now their leader. He is expected to return shortly with his wife, who they say knows how to cure this poison. My problem. The captain is in deep shock. I must keep him warm and alive until then. 
__label__MCCOY Don't tell me you've got a feeling. 
__label__MCCOY A piece of lead in his body. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know that yet either.
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps it died of the disease the girl's talking about. 
__label__MCCOY Representing the high teer, Leonard James Akaar. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in this universe? 
__label__MCCOY It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her. 
__label__MCCOY How do I know? I could have made a thousand mistakes. Sealing nerve endings, joining ganglia. The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know. 
__label__MCCOY The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it. 
__label__MCCOY His brain is gone. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I have a new reading. The lights must have triggered some mechanism. 
__label__MCCOY How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow you apart. 
__label__MCCOY Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood. 
__label__MCCOY Hysterical amnesia. When a man feels guilty about something, something too terrible to remember, he blots it out of his conscious memory. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I've heard of reluctant brides, but this is ridiculous. 
__label__MCCOY What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God. 
__label__MCCOY I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature? 
__label__MCCOY Then we'd better become experts, and fast. 
__label__MCCOY How do you feel, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY I think it's time we got aboard ship, isn't it, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I do. Mister Scott, please. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. What about Jim? 
__label__MCCOY How about coming up with another move, then? 
__label__MCCOY You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan! 
__label__MCCOY It's still got us. 
__label__MCCOY The Keeper's dead.
__label__MCCOY Makes sense. 
__label__MCCOY What those children saw is incredible, Jim. The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia. That's my diagnosis. Until specific tests can be made, it remains that. 
__label__MCCOY I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious state. He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear.
__label__MCCOY Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
__label__MCCOY Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists? 
__label__MCCOY Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others? 
__label__MCCOY After that? 
__label__MCCOY In these trying times, one of the few. Doctor Leonard McCoy. And you?  SHAW: Areel Shaw. And I'm a friend, too. An old one. 
__label__MCCOY It should have worked. Did you inhale the gas, Scotty?
