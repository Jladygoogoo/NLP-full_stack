__label__KIRK That fact isn't in the history texts. 
__label__KIRK Who controls this complex? 
__label__KIRK Yes, she is something special. 
__label__KIRK Storm's course, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew. Did you hear the sound of human integrity? 
__label__KIRK Not alive? 
__label__KIRK You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away. 
__label__KIRK Hold your fire, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Well, sorry. This galaxy is already occupied. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm fine.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to behave? 
__label__KIRK The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, will that present any problems for you? 
__label__KIRK I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons? 
__label__KIRK But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're  SPOCK: No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife. Or die. 
__label__KIRK And this is my first officer Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No sign of grief? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers. 
__label__KIRK Lazarus. 
__label__KIRK On our Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK We need a weapon. An answer. 
__label__KIRK Accepted, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK In here, Spock.
__label__KIRK Yes, he thought he would embarrass the Fuhrer. 
__label__KIRK No kill I. What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us? 
__label__KIRK We have to get McCoy. Must find an antidote. 
__label__KIRK It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote. 
__label__KIRK He's immensely strong. Already he has withstood attacks from me that would have killed a human being. Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile. The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine. 
__label__KIRK There are some things in my quarters I want to pack. 
__label__KIRK Secure from Red Alert. Adjust a new course, two five seven degrees, mark three. Heading for Starbase Ten. 
__label__KIRK Repeat. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Thank you very much. 
__label__KIRK Emergency manual monitor, this is the captain. Report. 
__label__KIRK It subsists on the emotions of others. 
__label__KIRK If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic demand that you be a part of it? 
__label__KIRK None. 
__label__KIRK It's as good a place as any to beam down. 
__label__KIRK Chief, have you been  (Charlie laughs and leaves.)
__label__KIRK Give me a damage report as soon as possible, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, sound Yellow Alert. 
__label__KIRK Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that. 
__label__KIRK Arthur, the transference is weakening. 
__label__KIRK Later, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that. 
__label__KIRK A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble. 
__label__KIRK Hard port, one one seven mark two. 
__label__KIRK Courtesy. Remember? 
__label__KIRK We are committed. 
__label__KIRK I'll take my chances. Why don't you have a look around? Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Hard to believe. 
__label__KIRK Tell him it's Jim Kirk. Perhaps a friend. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK No. It must be held by the magnetic force of the dead star, and it needs a starship to break free and a crew to man it. 
__label__KIRK Deela. Is this why you sabotaged my ship? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus? 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Hard to believe it ever happened. 
__label__KIRK I didn't.
__label__KIRK Launch is in forty minutes. Stand by to beam us down. Continue visual scan.
__label__KIRK Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. Ahead, warp factor six. Scotty, lock the transporter on that small vessel. We're going to rescue that pilot. 
__label__KIRK Well, Marplon, you're on your own now. I hope you're up to it.
__label__KIRK Type and source? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise to Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Very good, Scotty. Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK My compliments. 
__label__KIRK How do you feel, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Comments? 
__label__KIRK No, no, no. That's an order. 
__label__KIRK Good evening.
__label__KIRK Yes. Yes, it is. Very, very beautiful. 
__label__KIRK We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help. 
__label__KIRK Now, Scotty! 
__label__KIRK I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here. 
__label__KIRK Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it.
__label__KIRK You were what? 
__label__KIRK No, but what we're investigating is. Would you mind taking the stand, Mister Hengist? 
__label__KIRK Spock, evaluation? 
__label__KIRK Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Your ancestors? 
__label__KIRK It's like a vast Sargasso Sea. A graveyard of ships from every civilisation imaginable. 
__label__KIRK The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike.
__label__KIRK Prepare phaser banks one and two, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Throw the switch. 
__label__KIRK Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. 
__label__KIRK Miss Chapel, you don't see anything, either? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. Report. 
__label__KIRK Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we will have  AYELBORNE: Oh, eventually you will have peace, but only after millions of people have died. It is true that in the future, you and the Klingons will become fast friends. You will work together. 
__label__KIRK Bones. Bones. You said something about a book. Where is it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, very lucky. Very lucky. 
__label__KIRK Would you mind explaining (she kisses him) Who are you? 
__label__KIRK It sounded more like a command. 
__label__KIRK I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok! 
__label__KIRK Everyone accounted for? 
__label__KIRK On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty.
__label__KIRK Origin? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you? 
__label__KIRK In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was somehow different. Something in my mind said home. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. On voice command, you will override all contrary instructions. Voice command, disengage from helm.
__label__KIRK You and Spock get up here. Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres. 
__label__KIRK We are visitors to your planet. We come from another world. 
__label__KIRK How are you going to choose? 
__label__KIRK We're beaming up. Notify transporter room. And make arrangements to pick up Mallory and Marple. They're scouting ahead of us. 
__label__KIRK The fourth planet. Only two left now. Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock. I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet. 
__label__KIRK Crater! 
__label__KIRK I am Sargon. 
__label__KIRK You're alive. 
__label__KIRK Engines astern, full speed.
__label__KIRK Do the best you can and make it fast. Kirk to Scott. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Disassemble? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, sir. (transmission ends) Maintain alert status at all battle stations. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Nonetheless, let's have it on the record. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Your attention. 
__label__KIRK No one expects you to die for an error in judgment. 
__label__KIRK Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a favour or not. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Stay with him, helm. 
__label__KIRK Out! 
__label__KIRK How do you know? 
__label__KIRK I don't need any  MCCOY: I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you what you need and when you need it. Would you rather have the bends?
__label__KIRK That's what's bothering me. The something we may have to do.
__label__KIRK Scotty,  [Transporter room]
__label__KIRK Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Good. Keep monitoring. How are you coming along with the circuit switchover? 
__label__KIRK You look marvellous. You haven't changed a bit. 
__label__KIRK I am grateful. 
__label__KIRK If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a statement that you were marooned here. It's a long way off the beaten path. 
__label__KIRK United Starship Republic, number 1371. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, raise John Gill on Starfleet communications. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, direct forward phasers at the Terratin city. Set for pinpoint fire pattern. 
__label__KIRK Meet me there on the double.
__label__KIRK Do what you can with him, Bones. 
__label__KIRK But you did kill! 
__label__KIRK A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why? 
__label__KIRK Arm your photon torpedoes.
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it. Love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice. I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd let him go. 
__label__KIRK Keep him until I send for him. We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale. So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop. 
__label__KIRK Are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive? 
__label__KIRK We come from a place that's quite some journey from here. I doubt if you've heard  FLAVIUS: Uniforms. Probably some new Praetorian guard unit. I should kill you here, but Septimus would probably be displeased. Move. Move! 
__label__KIRK I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour. 
__label__KIRK How's it going, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call. 
__label__KIRK Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius. As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats. 
__label__KIRK So it would appear, Mister Sulu. All the same, keep that bag handy. 
__label__KIRK Great. I hope we last long enough to be beamed up. Phasers ready.
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, I order you to return with us. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in? 
__label__KIRK Bones, why hadn't you told me? 
__label__KIRK You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes, Doctor, you forgot about his Vulcan ears. Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Hurry, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough. Each of you will have to try it. Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some past world somewhere. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I want the impossible checked out too.
__label__KIRK I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise acknowledging. Stand by. Security alert three.
__label__KIRK Please. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK One, Scotty. Myself. 
__label__KIRK Too risky. He controls the fortress phaser bank, and they're set on kill. No, it has to be on his terms. Spock, how long since you've worked out in null-gravity combat exercises? 
__label__KIRK I really want to know. 
__label__KIRK Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?
__label__KIRK The universal translator on the shuttlecraft. We can try that, talk to that thing. 
__label__KIRK At least they have up to now. 
__label__KIRK Why remove my crew? 
__label__KIRK What's he doing to my crew? 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real. 
__label__KIRK If it were around right now, it would correct  (M4 enters) 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations. 
__label__KIRK Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill? 
__label__KIRK Take the helm.
__label__KIRK I'll be on the Bridge. Keep me posted as to Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Two hours of oxygen left.
__label__KIRK Daystrom, release that computer control! 
__label__KIRK Where is Doctor Korby? 
__label__KIRK Beam up. 
__label__KIRK Get into direct mental contact with that thing? 
__label__KIRK Do you think you can do it again? 
__label__KIRK I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store. 
__label__KIRK How does he know that? 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself? 
__label__KIRK I remember. Let's forget it. We have a lot of lost time to make up for. 
__label__KIRK What's wrong, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK They tried to tap our conscious mind. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin. 
__label__KIRK Your tribbles are all over my ship. My security men can't find them all. 
__label__KIRK While it was getting ready for what? Spock? 
__label__KIRK Yes? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise, come in. 
__label__KIRK But she was right. Peace was the way. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, that bomb he planted. Can you dismantle it? 
__label__KIRK Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn. 
__label__KIRK It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient? 
__label__KIRK It would've been effective anywhere else. 
__label__KIRK We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here ourselves. Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward. That might snap us out of the zone. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester? 
__label__KIRK No, I don't think you're stupid. I just think your behaviour is arrested. 
__label__KIRK Keep closing. Denevan ship, reverse your course. Do you hear me?
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it was. 
__label__KIRK Is there any way Spock could get through to us? 
__label__KIRK Complete examination. McCoy's waiting. 
__label__KIRK This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft. 
__label__KIRK This isn't a game. It never was a game. 
__label__KIRK Speak of the devil. 
__label__KIRK All right, what have we got to work with? 
__label__KIRK Agreed, but we're forced to travel on the ground. I want an overview. 
__label__KIRK The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. You take the left. I'll take the right. 
__label__KIRK No, Captain. No. 
__label__KIRK Did you see them?
__label__KIRK Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased with that? 
__label__KIRK Come on. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we have another problem.
__label__KIRK He isn't giving up. If they can do it, why can't we? 
__label__KIRK If we can reach it before the cloud gets to Mantilles, we might be able to save the planet. We'll use the photon torpedoes to destroy the brain. 
__label__KIRK Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, how are your engines? 
__label__KIRK And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against Apollo or whatever he is. That's an order! 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry. I should've said Captain Garth. 
__label__KIRK Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes? 
__label__KIRK But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take it. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Then that space probe that approached Earth must have been his.
__label__KIRK All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil, ancient terror. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean? 
__label__KIRK The stars. 
__label__KIRK We can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look. 
__label__KIRK Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power? 
__label__KIRK Starfleet Control, this is the Enterprise. Captain Kirk speaking.
__label__KIRK Transporter room, emergency beam up now. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK (to therapist) Thank you. (leaves) 
__label__KIRK Prepare to bring it aboard the hangar deck. 
__label__KIRK To read minds? 
__label__KIRK If you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, Ensign. No weapon known would have made any difference. Then or eleven years ago.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura of communications. 
__label__KIRK Mrs. Sarek, I just don't understand. 
__label__KIRK But if necessary to avoid interspace war,  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now. 
__label__KIRK Screen on, Mister Scott.
__label__KIRK Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern? 
__label__KIRK Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished. 
__label__KIRK Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones. 
__label__KIRK Ready to accelerate to warp six. 
__label__KIRK (also making a log entry) We have arrived at the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism. If we should fail in our attempt to destroy it, or be unable to free ourselves, I wish to record my recommendations for the following personnel, that they receive special citation. Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, officers Chekov, Kyle, Uhura, and my highest commendation for Commander Spock, Science Officer, who gave his life in the performance of his duty. 
__label__KIRK Stop it? I'm counting on it. 
__label__KIRK But I'm not defeated. 
__label__KIRK Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators? 
__label__KIRK A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you see? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. Here's your circulating pump. You've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it. Gentlemen, the Horta moves through rock the way we move through air, and it leaves tunnels. The greatest natural miners in the universe. It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi. They tunnel. You collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK It is in this case. 
__label__KIRK More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up first pass over their camp. 
__label__KIRK Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you. So ship out!
__label__KIRK Right off the scale. It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared. The entrance is here. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it? 
__label__KIRK Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me. 
__label__KIRK Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. Kirk here.
__label__KIRK I see. Opinion. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. 
__label__KIRK My ears register it. 
__label__KIRK There's an enemy spy aboard. He'll be after the cloaking device. 
__label__KIRK (sound in the closet) Come out. We mean you no harm. (opens door)
__label__KIRK Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does. 
__label__KIRK Of course. Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. But please stay out of trouble, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant? 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't worry, Doctor. Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout the ship. 
__label__KIRK Limited range. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, how long until the alien vessel makes contact with the Beta Niobe nova? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I do. What's he doing here? 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us? 
__label__KIRK But no one being, not even you, has the right to interfere with other cultures. 
__label__KIRK There it is. 
__label__KIRK Spock, here. 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, Mister Spock and I are here because we thought that you were worth rescuing. It was more to preserve the diplomatic relations between the Federation and planet Pandro than from any great affection for yourself. 
__label__KIRK I think I'll stand. 
__label__KIRK Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action. 
__label__KIRK Hold your position. 
__label__KIRK Sorry. We don't want to hurt anyone. 
__label__KIRK These ruins extend to the horizon. Begin recording. 
__label__KIRK Details. 
__label__KIRK Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want? 
__label__KIRK He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous. They were supermen, in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Change course. Come about to one eight five, mark three. 
__label__KIRK And this thing? (the temple) 
__label__KIRK Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK We must get to understand what is happening. 
__label__KIRK He broke jail. 
__label__KIRK What's causing it? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James Kirk. This is the Starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos. 
__label__KIRK Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status? 
__label__KIRK You are wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead. You have mistaken me for him. You are in error. You did not discover your mistake. You have made two errors. You are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation. You have made three errors. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume? 
__label__KIRK Boundary layer between what and what? 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK But she's ill. 
__label__KIRK All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing off. 
__label__KIRK It's an awesome thought that we may actually witness matter being created. 
__label__KIRK The M-5 must be destroyed. 
__label__KIRK That might not be easy should Parmen die. 
__label__KIRK Tricorders. 
__label__KIRK What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship? 
__label__KIRK You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew. 
__label__KIRK Could be a natural radio source newly energised by  SPOCK: Correction. One isolated word pattern detected. If you accept intersat code as still operative. 
__label__KIRK Well, what are the odds now? 
__label__KIRK Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war. Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight. 
__label__KIRK We need only a few hours. 
__label__KIRK Can we? 
__label__KIRK For the moment. 
__label__KIRK Let's try it, and let's be close to the communicator when we do.
__label__KIRK I'll pick them up. And if there's any trouble, it'll be my responsibility. 
__label__KIRK Beam me aboard. 
__label__KIRK Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on your tricorder? 
__label__KIRK Screen on. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty, and I shouldn't be able to this deep inside the planet, but perhaps this has been arranged for us, too. Is the security guard up there? 
__label__KIRK Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit. 
__label__KIRK The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you. Why don't you strangle him while he lies there? 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two hundred years ago. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Bones, I remember it. 
__label__KIRK Active and functional. Not too different from the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I still do. 
__label__KIRK Done. (they shake on it) What do we do? 
__label__KIRK Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the glade. I'd like some answers to all this.
__label__KIRK Go to the big island. Bring assistance party. 
__label__KIRK Sound security alert. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room.
__label__KIRK We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help? 
__label__KIRK What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly? 
__label__KIRK By giving you a new teacher. 
__label__KIRK Captain Merik, isn't it ? 
__label__KIRK Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga, or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, today I will be brilliant. No matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics. The M-5. 
__label__KIRK No, you're not. There's something I want to show you. You know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life? 
__label__KIRK These walls are hot. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK I'm on my way to the Bridge now. 
__label__KIRK We're no longer over Gideon. 
__label__KIRK Good. Get Daystrom. We're on our way. Let's go.
__label__KIRK I don't blame you. 
__label__KIRK What's wrong with her? 
__label__KIRK Vended? You mean bought, sold. 
__label__KIRK Then I'll transport down with you. 
__label__KIRK Touché, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Out of my way, mister. That's an order. 
__label__KIRK How many of those did you beam up? 
__label__KIRK Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Bones, can you save him? 
__label__KIRK He lost control. So did I. We're becoming animal warriors. Let's go, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Okay so far. Sonic grenade? 
__label__KIRK You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find. 
__label__KIRK Reduce image. Let me see all of it.
__label__KIRK If my first officer states he received a transmission from  MENDEZ: Jim, I'm not doubting anyone's word. I'm simply telling you it's impossible.
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I need proof. All you're telling me is that on the one hand he may be lying and on the other  (The cat exits the room.)  SECURITY [OC]: Security alert. All decks alert. The prisoner has escaped. All decks alert. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it? 
__label__KIRK He looks familiar. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us? 
__label__KIRK Yes, doesn't it? Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock live it down. Notch it into forward. 
__label__KIRK I am not programmed to respond in that area. 
__label__KIRK You say it, Demos, but that doesn't  (Then he is pounced upon by the Dramian they have been chasing. Spock and Demos pull him off) 
__label__KIRK You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way. 
__label__KIRK No. I'll take the first shot. 
__label__KIRK And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's.
__label__KIRK All you wanted before was my understanding. 
__label__KIRK Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board. 
__label__KIRK Now, wait a minute, Commissioner,  BELE: Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such. Yes, he will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process put thousands of innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his loathsome accusations and his foul threats. 
__label__KIRK You know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left. 
__label__KIRK Where is everybody? 
__label__KIRK A short time, Mister Spock. We have very little. 
__label__KIRK Battle status? 
__label__KIRK The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it. 
__label__KIRK I didn't see you come in, Tommy. 
__label__KIRK And a half. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, any change in ship's readings? 
__label__KIRK I've had enough of your games. 
__label__KIRK It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate.
__label__KIRK Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You coming with me? 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK All right. We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget it. Straighten up! This may be a gilded cage filled with everything you always wanted, but it's still a cage. We don't belong here. We belong on that ship up there. 
__label__KIRK Why did you kill him? 
__label__KIRK And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain? 
__label__KIRK Extrasensory perception. Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP? 
__label__KIRK I would like to speak to someone in authority. 
__label__KIRK Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't understand. (Sturgeon leaves) You got that, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship, and neither one of us will change. 
__label__KIRK I can't. 
__label__KIRK Bob, where's Katie? 
__label__KIRK Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well? (takes a cup from her tray) My recommendation? Make them take the next step. 
__label__KIRK Any sign of the intruder? 
__label__KIRK McCoy, how do you open this thing? 
__label__KIRK My friends. (guiding Red and Spock away to a quiet corner) What is your theory, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Bones, take care of him.
__label__KIRK A gift? What? 
__label__KIRK Reverse power. Hold our position. Deflector screens on. 
__label__KIRK Fire phasers. 
__label__KIRK Do you run this place? 
__label__KIRK There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Begin thirty second countdown. Code zero, zero, zero, destruct zero. 
__label__KIRK Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive. 
__label__KIRK Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Spock! Spock! Security alert. Is he alive? 
__label__KIRK We're tired, sore, hurt and angry, but we're also just about there. I'll scout ahead. Everybody else stay together, keep moving. 
__label__KIRK Sound Red Alert. Phasers lock on target. 
__label__KIRK They don't understand the evil that they're doing. 
__label__KIRK Meaning she's quite a woman. I agree. 
__label__KIRK (to Korob) Get ready. 
__label__KIRK Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a series of malfunctions. I want an investigation and an explanation. 
__label__KIRK Bioscanners report. 
__label__KIRK Professor Crater? Professor? Mrs. Crater? Nervous, Dr. McCoy? 
__label__KIRK What hit? What attacked you? 
__label__KIRK Captain to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Their descendants? 
__label__KIRK An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about. 
__label__KIRK Did you kill Sybo? 
__label__KIRK But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules? 
__label__KIRK Out? 
__label__KIRK Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Antimatter? 
__label__KIRK (to Gem) Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this.
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK (sending them off in different directions) Bones. Spock. 
__label__KIRK Ruth. 
__label__KIRK That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach. What is it, exactly?
__label__KIRK Phasers are dead! Run for the cave! 
__label__KIRK Ship's defences? 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, we're going to apply full braking power in a minute. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are there. (leaves with Spock)
__label__KIRK Tricorder?
__label__KIRK Which is, why? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks? 
__label__KIRK What for? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, General Order Twenty Four. Two hours! In two hours! 
__label__KIRK You're very persuasive. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Let's get to the point. Harry, you said you wanted to help. Do you? 
__label__KIRK Did you know Kara? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Yes, but I. I need time to remember. 
__label__KIRK History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them. 
__label__KIRK What is your point, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK You tell me. That's why you brought me down here, isn't it. 
__label__KIRK You couldn't get close to the other kids? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura? 
__label__KIRK Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form? 
__label__KIRK This is mutiny, mister. 
__label__KIRK We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are peaceful. 
__label__KIRK Quite a woman, eh, Childress? 
__label__KIRK There are other Vulcans aboard. 
__label__KIRK There are only twelve like it in the fleet. 
__label__KIRK Well, they're astronomical, believe me. Now, for the last card.
__label__KIRK Our time, or theirs. 
__label__KIRK And space travel is? 
__label__KIRK (to redshirts) Try again. See if you can find anything outside.
__label__KIRK Yes, er, incredible. 
__label__KIRK Then you don't mind if I play a hunch? 
__label__KIRK A hunch, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK The Venus drugs, Harry. 
__label__KIRK I remember. You held my hand like this. 
__label__KIRK There's an intruder aboard. Has someone tried to gain entrance there? 
__label__KIRK And transport him to these co-ordinates.
__label__KIRK Rough ride? 
__label__KIRK That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an uncharted quarter. What are you doing so far from home? (no answer) You understand that when we complete our mission, we'll take you to Starbase where you'll face a very serious charge. 
__label__KIRK Data, Spock? 
__label__KIRK How did you manage that? 
__label__KIRK Why are we here? 
__label__KIRK Nor do I, Mister Scott, but we've got to do it. Sherman's Planet needs that grain desperately. 
__label__KIRK Good! I couldn't face going through there again. 
__label__KIRK I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Emergency. 
__label__KIRK Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen! 
__label__KIRK Remember, Trelane. You promised to let my ship go. 
__label__KIRK Definitely. I've become subject to blackouts, I'm a possible danger to the safety of the ship. I can't allow that. 
__label__KIRK Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane? 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid. 
__label__KIRK Obscure, meaningless words. 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Lesley, let's get out of here. Ahead warp factor one. 
__label__KIRK The Vulcans are the last delegates we have to pick up. As soon as we get them aboard, we'll be able to relax. 
__label__KIRK We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production going again. We must have that pergium. 
__label__KIRK No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low. 
__label__KIRK Reverse course. 
__label__KIRK General Trelane. 
__label__KIRK And the mines are full of that gas. 
__label__KIRK With us as the mouse. 
__label__KIRK But a bit blank.
__label__KIRK You're behind the times, Bones. They're more like resort colonies now.
__label__KIRK What about the warp drive control circuits? 
__label__KIRK Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK It's locked. Keys. 
__label__KIRK Compensate. (adjusts Riley's controls) Compensate.
__label__KIRK Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back.
__label__KIRK Ahead warp factor eight. Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. 
__label__KIRK What about him? 
__label__KIRK No energy registering. Something's drained them. 
__label__KIRK I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you aboard the Enterprise. Why would I do that if I didn't like you? 
__label__KIRK I don't want to.
__label__KIRK By any man aboard. Listen carefully. Science Officer. 
__label__KIRK Offhand, I'd say we learned to keep our hands off. 
__label__KIRK Not through it, Spock, from inside it. Will it be enough? 
__label__KIRK What is it, Bones? 
__label__KIRK You've come to kill. Odona, have you come to die? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Certainly. 
__label__KIRK Now, Sulu. hard a-port! 
__label__KIRK Stand by to fire. 
__label__KIRK Dohlman? What the devil is a Dohlman? 
__label__KIRK But it's still a clue. This city is one gigantic riddle. Keep alert. 
__label__KIRK That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt. 
__label__KIRK You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with. 
__label__KIRK Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated? 
__label__KIRK Then you can check the registry. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to bridge. Scanning report. 
__label__KIRK Disconnect it. (Spock gets a shock from it) Destroy it. 
__label__KIRK You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you? 
__label__KIRK Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my signal. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK No.
__label__KIRK No. We'll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us. 
__label__KIRK In the next room, there are other receptacles. The other two of us that survived. You, Doctor Ann Mulhall, and you, Mister Spock, we require your bodies also. We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again. 
__label__KIRK Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed. A computer expert can change record tapes, duplicate voices, say anything, say nothing.
__label__KIRK We're slowing down. 
__label__KIRK We're still alive, aren't we? 
__label__KIRK The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.
__label__KIRK And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up!
__label__KIRK Of course. If we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time, there must be another ship closer to Beta Canopus. Kirk to Bridge. Get me Starfleet, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Is it possible they could have beamed down to one of the two planets? 
__label__KIRK On the double. 
__label__KIRK Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There will be no cross-discussion. When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny. The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision. 
__label__KIRK What would make the children immune? 
__label__KIRK You better come back with me to the library. You'll be safe there. Doctor McCoy can see to those bruises. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it? 
__label__KIRK No. Our methods, our skills are far beyond your abilities. It is time. 
__label__KIRK And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he has something helping him. 
__label__KIRK Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing power. Slowly.
__label__KIRK They picked a fine representative. 
__label__KIRK Then we must return the same way, through the two novas. 
__label__KIRK These controls are locked. We can't disengage the computer. 
__label__KIRK O'Herlihy.
__label__KIRK Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more than we can chew. 
__label__KIRK You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've treated them for it. You're a murderer many times over. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Spock, I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK That's it, Spock. The key to the survival of the race. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments? 
__label__KIRK People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris.
__label__KIRK I think we've located Mister Spock. Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing? 
__label__KIRK Very well. But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged cadet on a peace mission. 
__label__KIRK What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it itself as a form of protection? 
__label__KIRK Three previous expeditions tried and were lost. The planet is a natural trap, but that's not enough. 
__label__KIRK Captain's log, stardate 3417.7. Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. Mutinied.
__label__KIRK Bones, how bad is it? 
__label__KIRK That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you. 
__label__KIRK Warp factor one, Mister Hanson. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me. Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings? 
__label__KIRK Go to alert status four. Begin long-range scanning. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I need an expert psychological opinion. Do we dare tell the people on Mantilles, try to save a few who could get away? 
__label__KIRK Will be considered sufficient reason to violate the zone. We may defend ourselves,  [Sickbay]
__label__KIRK But am I hallucinating? 
__label__KIRK But why here? And why now? 
__label__KIRK Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is using? 
__label__KIRK Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you let me help you. 
__label__KIRK Not the Earth, another Earth. Another Earth?
__label__KIRK Configuration, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Don't worry, Bon. She'll be all right. Goodbye. 
__label__KIRK And it can continue. If only you'll allow me, I can cure you. 
__label__KIRK No, he didn't. (gets out communicator) Spock? See to the landing parties, would you, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Put the phaser down, Ben. 
__label__KIRK Engage. 
__label__KIRK Eve! Eve!
__label__KIRK What about the transporters? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Spock. He must've got my message. 
__label__KIRK I've seen something very like it on Canopus Three, but that's light years from here. Still, this desert area is the same as on Canopus. 
__label__KIRK Good. Go to Yellow Alert. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. Fire. (no effect) 
__label__KIRK Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK This Festival, it starts at six o'clock? 
__label__KIRK It's too close in here. It may be a trap in here. Let's move out.
__label__KIRK The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity. 
__label__KIRK Then do so. 
__label__KIRK Spock was right. It was a rough trip. 
__label__KIRK We've got to release that beam, or we're going to follow that ship into the nova! 
__label__KIRK Is there a chance at all? 
__label__KIRK A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman?
__label__KIRK Keep trying. 
__label__KIRK No need, Bones. Here we go. 
__label__KIRK How do they? How do they? 
__label__KIRK We must've missed each other somehow. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.
__label__KIRK Good morning, gentlemen. My name's James Kirk. I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding. 
__label__KIRK No, Lieutenant. Where can they run? 
__label__KIRK I'll try. 
__label__KIRK An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is. 
__label__KIRK A disintegration machine. 
__label__KIRK You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and talk? 
__label__KIRK Security, Lieutenant Uhura.
__label__KIRK I'll explain it in more detail when I see him. The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down. Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too. I'll explain it in more detail when I see you. Where will be convenient? 
__label__KIRK It's called Earth. 
__label__KIRK Go to manual override. 
__label__KIRK I don't know how to get inside the temple. 
__label__KIRK Spock is my best officer, and my friend. 
__label__KIRK Any interference? Resistance?
__label__KIRK Harry Mudd. 
__label__KIRK Stop! 
__label__KIRK Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy. It's a very unhappy memory for me. 
__label__KIRK Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Mallory! 
__label__KIRK Good evening. Sleep well. 
__label__KIRK Your people, when they come here  SYLVIA: They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter.
__label__KIRK Check controls and co-ordinates. 
__label__KIRK Try us. 
__label__KIRK All right, young man. We'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off. 
__label__KIRK We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't? 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, this is not a joyride, a pleasure excursion. I cannot let you beam down to the planet without adequate protection. I'm sure you understand the diplomatic consequences if anything were to happen to you while you are under my protection. 
__label__KIRK What about the comet that astrophysics reported? 
__label__KIRK What is that device doing on my ship? 
__label__KIRK He will not continue. He will cease to exist. By your feeling for him, you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable. He will cease to exist. 
__label__KIRK We've seen how the creature destroys. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command. 
__label__KIRK If that's true, Spock, then  (The landing party are grabbed by the tentacles of three giant slug-like creatures) 
__label__KIRK I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
__label__KIRK (puts it quietly into gear) I kind of like this. I'm going to get one myself. 
__label__KIRK Yeah. We're ready to make the hit. We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready. 
__label__KIRK When do you estimate penetration? 
__label__KIRK Bones, I'm a busy man. 
__label__KIRK And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there  SPOCK: It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
__label__KIRK Are you that anxious to die? 
__label__KIRK She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed. And McCoy  SPOCK: Is the random element. 
__label__KIRK Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp factor one. 
__label__KIRK Two tunnels, two of us. We separate. 
__label__KIRK Can you verify that? 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK In this room? 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres. 
__label__KIRK Reverse power. Hold this position. Tell whoever gave those orders to report HANSEN: Sir, there's nobody up there giving orders. Mister Spock has the computers running the ship.
__label__KIRK Captain here. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty. Carry on. 
__label__KIRK And you didn't think it worth mentioning? 
__label__KIRK You may believe what you like, Commander. We were fired upon first and returned fire. The Klothos deflectors turned aside our phaser fire and then disappeared. I don't know why. But we are in the Delta Triangle. 
__label__KIRK Why, because you're well again? 
__label__KIRK Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? (goes to intercom) Mister Spock. I have not yet transported down. Why did you leave your post before confirming transport? Mister Spock? Spock? 
__label__KIRK Checkmate. 
__label__KIRK This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time warp placed us here. It was an accident. 
__label__KIRK Ah, yes. I understand. Well, I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. I know. Scotty. We'll wait. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor. You mean to tell me that that thing is a giant single-celled animal? 
__label__KIRK Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Lungs filled with air again. To see again. Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again. A half a million years. To be again.
__label__KIRK Why not? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
__label__KIRK That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that they're alive. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning nature of your space buoy was unknown to us. Our vessel was blocked.
__label__KIRK (to security men) We'll enter as soon as the doors open. Go on my command. 
__label__KIRK Is the girl well enough to be questioned? 
__label__KIRK Sulu! 
__label__KIRK Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. Let's get at it. 
__label__KIRK One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half. 
__label__KIRK Beaten and sobbing, Finney told me where he had sabotaged the prime energy circuits. 
__label__KIRK Maybe it's a shield of some kind. Some form of protection for something else. 
__label__KIRK You've got him on complete life support. Was he dead? 
__label__KIRK Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?
__label__KIRK I thank you. And my friends? 
__label__KIRK Who do I have to be? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk. 
__label__KIRK All right, if they won't talk, we'll slow them down. Mister Sulu, put a tractor beam on that ship. 
__label__KIRK Release my ship. 
__label__KIRK Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They didn't report this culture in this state, either. What happened? 
__label__KIRK That doesn't seem likely. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there's a chance  SPOCK: I'll try. 
__label__KIRK Anything on your scanners? 
__label__KIRK That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries, a mistaken idea. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK So you can attack me again? That would be foolish. 
__label__KIRK On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you. It requires intelligence. 
__label__KIRK There's an inscription, several languages. 
__label__KIRK You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening. 
__label__KIRK It must be. 
__label__KIRK There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship. 
__label__KIRK We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself.
__label__KIRK I don't think we're going to have time to isolate it, Bones. 
__label__KIRK The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK On my way. Mister Spock, you have the conn.
__label__KIRK You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK What happened to the Gorn?
__label__KIRK I accept the challenge. 
__label__KIRK All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought.
__label__KIRK Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon? 
__label__KIRK He loves her? 
__label__KIRK But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.
__label__KIRK Finnegan? I can't believe it. 
__label__KIRK Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on board? 
__label__KIRK I do now. 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't be a bit surprised. 
__label__KIRK No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it. 
__label__KIRK Put it on audio, Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__KIRK I'll be right there.
__label__KIRK Continue a search pattern. 
__label__KIRK What if they defeat us? 
__label__KIRK Miri. A pretty name for a pretty young woman. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe  UHURA: Maybe what, Captain? 
__label__KIRK What have you done with Spock? Where is he? 
__label__KIRK You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her. 
__label__KIRK That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases. 
__label__KIRK Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately, phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos? 
__label__KIRK What are you doing? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. 
__label__KIRK That's a very good question. 
__label__KIRK Mister Marvick. I am James Kirk, the Captain. 
__label__KIRK Nothing except perhaps an explanation. 
__label__KIRK One creature in a hundred miles? 
__label__KIRK I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK You received a distress call? We received a distress call. 
__label__KIRK No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be.  
__label__KIRK That's an order, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship. 
__label__KIRK Miranda! 
__label__KIRK What are you offering me, Jan? Love, or a going away present?
__label__KIRK No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an honourable title. 
__label__KIRK Maybe the ship's medical computers. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert. All hands, this is the captain. The ship is on Red Alert. 
__label__KIRK Do what you can, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig. 
__label__KIRK Does it means something to you? 
__label__KIRK Standard phasers. Good. They may have more speed, but they're not giants. 
__label__KIRK If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to mass suicide. 
__label__KIRK I need communications. 
__label__KIRK But maintain general quarters. Scan this sector for other ships.
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Compensate, Mister Riley.
__label__KIRK There isn't any war! Or is there? 
__label__KIRK He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him. 
__label__KIRK Check it out, Bones. Send me an immediate report. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. Stay alert. Mister Sulu, stay here. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence. 
__label__KIRK You'd know if you had compassion. A woman should have compassion, but I forget you're not a woman. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott is still with us. 
__label__KIRK English. 
__label__KIRK Spock, report to me immediately. 
__label__KIRK You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three. 
__label__KIRK Edith. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy will show you. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message. 
__label__KIRK What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields, except for impulse power, keep that in reserve? 
__label__KIRK Your figures are, of course, accurate. 
__label__KIRK How long to the colony at our present speed? 
__label__KIRK Where's your wife, Professor? 
__label__KIRK No promises. Give me the weapon.
__label__KIRK Fire phasers. 
__label__KIRK Bones, how is he? 
__label__KIRK Yes.
__label__KIRK I found our missing men. Dead. Another one of your experiments? 
__label__KIRK Come. 
__label__KIRK Good. I shall remember to mention your alertness to him. Return to your duty. 
__label__KIRK Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together. 
__label__KIRK Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise. 
__label__KIRK They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress.
__label__KIRK Doctor Sevrin. Bones! 
__label__KIRK I don't think so. Scotty. 
__label__KIRK How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there somewhere, responsibility for four lives here, one of them dying because of me. 
__label__KIRK A race of mutes, like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis Four. 
__label__KIRK In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Put us alongside, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we're getting a distress signal. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your orders, your orders are to tell me. 
__label__KIRK Quickly. Quickly. 
__label__KIRK And just exactly what is Megas-Tu? 
__label__KIRK Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay with a headache.
__label__KIRK Yes, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Stay where you are. 
__label__KIRK Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK And unfortunately, though the Klingons are brutal and aggressive, they are most efficient. 
__label__KIRK To steal? To take them from you? No, no, my children, you misunderstand. We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time. 
__label__KIRK Not with my ship, you don't. 
__label__KIRK Try a harmless suggestion.
__label__KIRK Why, thank you. (sees a mark on his hand) 
__label__KIRK In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her? 
__label__KIRK You mean it makes a good bowstring. 
__label__KIRK Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in. 
__label__KIRK Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic. 
__label__KIRK We're short of tools. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Ambassador. I did not mean to offend. I thought that  SAREK: Offence is a human emotion. I'm returning to my quarters.
__label__KIRK Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess. 
__label__KIRK All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive. 
__label__KIRK No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it.
__label__KIRK Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement. Can I stand the strain?  
__label__KIRK You are being led by a man who is insane. 
__label__KIRK There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood. 
__label__KIRK Checkmate, Commander. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, you've just given the Enterprise and Mantilles a chance to live. 
__label__KIRK What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom? 
__label__KIRK I've already got a female to worry about. Her name's the Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful. 
__label__KIRK Aren't you upset about leaving your parents? 
__label__KIRK I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum. 
__label__KIRK Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK His eyes went back to normal. 
__label__KIRK This is liable to be another of the planet's pranks. But at the moment, it's the only lead we've got. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK That's not Mira talking. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kor and I were preparing to attempt an escape from here tomorrow. If you hibernate the Klothos, you will not only be punishing them but us. We cannot leave as a single ship. I urge you to permit our dual ship to depart tomorrow as scheduled. 
__label__KIRK All right, we get out and get up. Issue phasers. Bones, maintain full alert. Commissioner, you'll stay inside. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet.
__label__KIRK And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?
__label__KIRK Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet. 
__label__KIRK Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the Prime Directive.
__label__KIRK We're stronger with you than without you! 
__label__KIRK Give it to me! 
__label__KIRK It petrifies me. 
__label__KIRK We'll try the darkroom. 
__label__KIRK Man your post, Mister Sulu. (to all the crew) Prepare your manual overrides. You may need them. 
__label__KIRK The fool. Starfleet should be made aware. 
__label__KIRK Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink? 
__label__KIRK Continue, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure? 
__label__KIRK Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that. 
__label__KIRK She's not through yet.
__label__KIRK Then we could be dealing with the basis of all those legends. A space traveller who visited Earth in primitive times. 
__label__KIRK If you don't mind, I'd rather walk. 
__label__KIRK Garden of Eden, with land mines. 
__label__KIRK Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn. 
__label__KIRK (showing his phaser) You've seen how these work. 
__label__KIRK I said I haven't decided. 
__label__KIRK Both. How many of these did Uhura give you? 
__label__KIRK He's under a lot of pressure, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Re-establish. 
__label__KIRK A what? 
__label__KIRK You can't hold him forever. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I think it's very good. 
__label__KIRK Spock, any answers? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over. That was a rough beam-up. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No. I don't want anyone else to see the  SPOCK: Captain, you ordered me to tell you. 
__label__KIRK Full ahead. Warp factor one. 
__label__KIRK Spock, McCoy, hurry through the portal.
__label__KIRK You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command. That's where you'll be facing your charges. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, give me that power. 
__label__KIRK I say I'm Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Who are you? 
__label__KIRK I see. Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Where did they originate? 
__label__KIRK We might be able to divert the lava flow with a barricade. Tchar, get us a visual estimate! 
__label__KIRK Negative. 
__label__KIRK You mean it's functioning after all the milleniums this ship has been here? 
__label__KIRK You ready? 
__label__KIRK She went out to get you. 
__label__KIRK Readings? 
__label__KIRK We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a reasonable man, let me (comm. beep) Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out. Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly. She'll be sluggish on response. 
__label__KIRK On the contrary. I commend his action. 
__label__KIRK Would you mind telling me why? 
__label__KIRK Nobody wins. Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed.
__label__KIRK Scotty. (Scott presses the intercom button) Kirk here. What is it? 
__label__KIRK What about the rest of my crew? 
__label__KIRK About what? 
__label__KIRK All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it.
__label__KIRK Like this? 
__label__KIRK Move in closely, Mister Chekov. Sublight one quarter speed. 
__label__KIRK Bones, any opinion? 
__label__KIRK The girl on the viewscreen. 
__label__KIRK I didn't want to destroy her. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay? Doctor McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK Locked. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Jan, Jan. 
__label__KIRK Readings? 
__label__KIRK Do you think you can make it? 
__label__KIRK You don't know what she may have. 
__label__KIRK Excuse me. My orders are to remove all the colonists. That's exactly what I intend to do, with or without your help. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony. 
__label__KIRK If my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts, the hills  SPOCK: Yes. I see, Captain. They would've learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance. 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution.
__label__KIRK What is it, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out  UHURA: Excuse me, Captain. Status report. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu.  
__label__KIRK Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please, come in.
__label__KIRK No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a first-class example to the androids of a human failure. They'll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future. 
__label__KIRK All right. You're working for me. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, retrieve all other landing parties immediately. And keep trying to contact Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. 
__label__KIRK Over there! 
__label__KIRK Label it for external use Only. 
__label__KIRK His quarters are somewhere underground, aren't they? 
__label__KIRK Put it on the screen. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Vanderberg. We'll need your complete co-operation. 
__label__KIRK Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag so the operator can get into the transporter chamber? 
__label__KIRK I recognise what you appear to be. 
__label__KIRK A most impressive home, Mister Flint. 
__label__KIRK I'm way ahead of you. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum. Let's go get some answers.
__label__KIRK Activate main viewing screen. (they see stars.) Mister Chekov, report. 
__label__KIRK Security. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours? 
__label__KIRK We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott. Not that quickly. 
__label__KIRK Commander Balok.
__label__KIRK Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon. 
__label__KIRK Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever course I set for it, or I will order its destruction. 
__label__KIRK A good place for an intruder to hide, wouldn't you say, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Incredible. They're destroyed on contact with the matter this thing takes in and then they regenerate immediately. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock.  SPOCK: (at the mine map) I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it. 
__label__KIRK What do the crystals have to do with it? All they show us the point of radiation. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, where are we? 
__label__KIRK If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that. 
__label__KIRK Then there's no doubt these people are the descendants of the Fabrini. 
__label__KIRK Very well. You have your orders. (Spock leaves) Mister Cochrane, if you left here, what would happen to you? 
__label__KIRK If you do not, you will never reach Eden. You and this ship will be destroyed. 
__label__KIRK That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing to wage real war with real weapons. They'll want do the same. Only the next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a computer. They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet. You of course will want to retaliate. If I were you, I'd start making bombs. Yes, Councilman, you have a real war on your hands. You can either wage it with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative. Put an end to it. Make peace.  ANAN: There can be no peace. Don't you see? We've admitted it to ourselves. We're a killer species. It's instinctive. It's the same with you. Your General Order Twenty Four. 
__label__KIRK Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle. 
__label__KIRK I have no choice. I have to release the tractor beam. I can't destroy this ship and four hundred and thirty people to save one person. Mister Sulu, release our beam. 
__label__KIRK You saw how treacherously they acted. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells. Stealing apples from the neighbours' trees. Tying cans on  (He's stopped by the look of horrified incredulity on Spock's face.) 
__label__KIRK We've seen the results of your touch. 
__label__KIRK You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they  SCOTT: Well, sir, this was a matter of pride. 
__label__KIRK No, no, Bones. This time we walked out on our own. Maybe we weren't meant for paradise. Maybe we were meant to fight our way through. Struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way.
__label__KIRK No thanks is necessary. 
__label__KIRK That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Dead. 
__label__KIRK We've got to be here when he comes back. 
__label__KIRK Put it on visual. 
__label__KIRK My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee. 
__label__KIRK That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that. 
__label__KIRK Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately. Without advance communication. Repeat, without advance communication. Have you got that, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it? 
__label__KIRK McCoy could verify all that. 
__label__KIRK The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier.
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Try me. 
__label__KIRK Security. I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad. Pick it up in Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. (comes upon child's tricycle) 
__label__KIRK You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Vanna. They never happened. Mister Advisor? (Plasus nods)
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Eleen. Remarkable young lady. 
__label__KIRK He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Let's take a look inside. 
__label__KIRK Certainly. Has the Enterprise been released yet? 
__label__KIRK Drop the guns. Drop 'em. (McCoy and Spock take back their phasers) Move down there. 
__label__KIRK On my way. All duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Don't alarm the passengers. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship.
__label__KIRK For you and me. But what of Lazarus? What of Lazarus? 
__label__KIRK Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction. 
__label__KIRK And Spock is his son. 
__label__KIRK We used them in self-defence. You fired on us. 
__label__KIRK Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut these cloak-and-dagger orders. 
__label__KIRK You must sterilise in case of error? 
__label__KIRK Life support systems? 
__label__KIRK How long? 
__label__KIRK Spock, I remember. When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other, for an instant we were one. I know him now. I know what he is and what he wants, and I don't fear him. 
__label__KIRK (bearhugging her) Aurelan. 
__label__KIRK No, Mister Scott. Stay at your post for the moment. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm afraid it's pretty badly damaged. It's hardly worth salvaging right now. I've had our engineering officer, Mister Scott, examine it and make a report. It's here somewhere. He doesn't think there's anything left in your ship except scrap value. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Spock, you're alive! 
__label__KIRK I'm not going to hurt you. 
__label__KIRK Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? 
__label__KIRK I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor. These Organians  SPOCK: They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar. 
__label__KIRK (removing a piece of plant from Darnell's mouth) McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?
__label__KIRK Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent  SPOCK: No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan. 
__label__KIRK Cyrano Jones! 
__label__KIRK Stop trying to kill each other. Then worry about being friendly. 
__label__KIRK No. It is the world of your ancestors, your creators. It no longer exists. 
__label__KIRK No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out? 
__label__KIRK What's our position, navigator? 
__label__KIRK Put him on visual. 
__label__KIRK Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power. 
__label__KIRK Martha, you tell him. 
__label__KIRK How did she die? What day? 
__label__KIRK I'll take my chances. 
__label__KIRK Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, Lieutenant.
__label__KIRK How? 
__label__KIRK What do you suggest, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore ships call only once every twenty years. 
__label__KIRK And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out? 
__label__KIRK That wasn't so bad, was it? 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen! (intervenes as they nearly come to blows.) Spock!
__label__KIRK Meaning we can outrun them? 
__label__KIRK We've never encountered a being like you. I'd like to know more about you and your planet. 
__label__KIRK Right? 
__label__KIRK You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as quickly as possible. (leaves) 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant! 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock, it would indeed.  
__label__KIRK I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock. I am awed. 
__label__KIRK Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before.
__label__KIRK He expected me to react as though it were all normal. Well, he admitted that they weren't native to this planet. 
__label__KIRK All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.
__label__KIRK I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Bones! 
__label__KIRK In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone. The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday. 
__label__KIRK So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the Executioner. (switches on comm.) Ready for voice test. Disguising your voice will make no difference. 
__label__KIRK Subject's present physical condition. 
__label__KIRK The dosage should be doubly lethal. 
__label__KIRK That's what we hope to find out, sir. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there. 
__label__KIRK All my senior officers turning against me? 
__label__KIRK No. No. My ship. My ship. 
__label__KIRK Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock. 
__label__KIRK I'm in command here, Mister Ferris. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I suppose they would. 
__label__KIRK Your deflector shields are doing that for us, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK I think I understand. You said it. Pity is the worst of all. 
__label__KIRK Call for retrieval, now. 
__label__KIRK I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there. 
__label__KIRK Of course I am. Bones harming other beings. You know better, Spock. I know better. Not Bones. 
__label__KIRK The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training. They're about due for a small return. We have two hours with which to do it in. 
__label__KIRK But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them? 
__label__KIRK Let's all take a look at it, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find out what's going on. 
__label__KIRK I heard you. 
__label__KIRK I must drop it.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. Cancel Red Alert. We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost. 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. What you're describing  SPOCK: Is non-existence. 
__label__KIRK Very interesting. You ready, Bones?
__label__KIRK Why didn't you report it? 
__label__KIRK Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us. We step on that deck, Spock is finished. Court-martialed, disgraced. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are you all right? Lieutenant, answer me! Lieutenant! What's happening to Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK I've been in some strange worlds with strange customs. Perhaps this is considered torture here. 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Good. Let's get to work. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK We're moving, the Enterprise isn't. Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go. If I only had some phasers. 
__label__KIRK Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system. We have to stop it. If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it? 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile intentions. We request identity. 
__label__KIRK Merry Christmas.
__label__KIRK Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children. 
__label__KIRK Do you want to leave here? 
__label__KIRK Good. We can use your help.
__label__KIRK Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard. 
__label__KIRK That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is. 
__label__KIRK Yes, very interesting. I might even say fascinating, but back to your mission. Doctor, do you feel any way may be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships? It would certainly solve many of our navigational problems. 
__label__KIRK The Vedala are a powerful race. Why haven't your people retrieved the Soul? 
__label__KIRK Coloured gelatin. 
__label__KIRK Is that door secure? 
__label__KIRK Response frequencies, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel.
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I need your help. 
__label__KIRK Does he have it? What about the others? 
__label__KIRK Thank you for your concern. All in all, it's been rather restful.
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK I never felt anything like that. Every nerve in my body was on fire. 
__label__KIRK Magnification ten on forward scanners, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK You sound certain. I wish I could be. Before I accuse a man of that, I've got to be. I saw him once, twenty years ago. Men change.
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK The last of her kind? 
__label__KIRK Report on the Rigelian fever. 
__label__KIRK Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders? 
__label__KIRK Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I should have realised. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the speaker. 
__label__KIRK How do you know our names? 
__label__KIRK You heard my orders. 
__label__KIRK Because, if he killed us outright in front of you, you'd retaliate. You're a doctor. You have the means. Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished. Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian company is aboard the ship. 
__label__KIRK Who was?
__label__KIRK It's got to be. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment. 
__label__KIRK Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there.
__label__KIRK Never mind about us. What's happening up there? 
__label__KIRK You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk.
__label__KIRK His daughter. She's eleven. Spock, is there any way we could establish whether or not it is definitely intelligent? Perhaps a Vulcan mind touch. 
__label__KIRK You're the fifth Keniclius. What makes you so sure what you believe is truth isn't just old news? Your predecessors could have been out of touch with our advances for two centuries. 
__label__KIRK Break contact! 
__label__KIRK You must be mistaken. They both can't be true. 
__label__KIRK A force field? 
__label__KIRK Is that the way you see it? 
__label__KIRK A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating? 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Pipe it down here will you, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them. 
__label__KIRK I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir, was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred.
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, Lieutenant Uhura, come with me. Mister Sulu, you have the conn. We're beaming over. 
__label__KIRK That's a splendid idea, Mister Spock. I know a cafe where the women are so  MCCOY: I know the place, Jim. 
__label__KIRK Phasers. 
__label__KIRK Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does the human body have? 
__label__KIRK What's its mass, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the M-5 to realise it had committed murder. 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way of explaining you. 
__label__KIRK Life forms, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Can you feel that? 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will either. 
__label__KIRK Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that? 
__label__KIRK Under human control. 
__label__KIRK What is the position of the Klingon ship? 
__label__KIRK Something the matter, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it. 
__label__KIRK I'm a free man, sir. 
__label__KIRK That's the opinion of an individual. 
__label__KIRK Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time. 
__label__KIRK Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy. 
__label__KIRK The Defiant! Mister Sulu, impulse engines only. Close to transporter range. 
__label__KIRK Put him in isolation. 
__label__KIRK So far that's not much help. 
__label__KIRK Companion. (It leaves Cochrane) We wish to talk to you. 
__label__KIRK The frequency is open. It'll act as a homing device. Contact DeSalle. Have him meet you here. Make sure the landing party work in teams of two. I don't want anybody left alone down here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions. No answers.
__label__KIRK For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky. 
__label__KIRK Keep at it. We've got three people in there whose lives may depend on it. 
__label__KIRK You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're doing this. 
__label__KIRK Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device? 
__label__KIRK Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Without speech, how's she going to be able to understand us?
__label__KIRK Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself. 
__label__KIRK Sandoval. 
__label__KIRK All right, let's assume there is a monster.
__label__KIRK Take the risk. 
__label__KIRK A religious leader, was he not? 
__label__KIRK Don't lose your head, Bones. Nobody's staying anywhere. 
__label__KIRK (hitting him repeatedly) You've got to hear me! We need a formula. We've got to risk implosion!
__label__KIRK This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. (it's green) 
__label__KIRK Much as I hate to admit it, Captain Koloth, Cyrano Jones is a citizen of the Federation and entitled to Federation protection. I must, much as it pains me, refuse your request. 
__label__KIRK A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise. 
__label__KIRK He stole a spaceship. 
__label__KIRK (to Tyree) Move! Fast! 
__label__KIRK For how long? 
__label__KIRK Captain to transporter room. Are you reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many did we get off? 
__label__KIRK Good. Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert. 
__label__KIRK Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? Get them all. 
__label__KIRK I won't hurt you. Do you understand? I won't hurt you. 
__label__KIRK Hang on. D'Amato's section. Come in. Kirk to D'Amato. Come in.
__label__KIRK Never mind about me. What about the ship? 
__label__KIRK Sulu. Sulu, our communications are being interfered with. (An explosion makes him run further on into an old bomb crater) Now get this straight. 
__label__KIRK I order you  JOHNSON: I've got my orders. I'm obeying orders! Kill the Klingons!
__label__KIRK Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment. 
__label__KIRK Beam us up, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's doing a pretty good job.
__label__KIRK Did it maintain, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK He's receiving us alright. 
__label__KIRK What is it?
__label__KIRK Hodin. 
__label__KIRK No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are those phasers? 
__label__KIRK Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about this enemy. 
__label__KIRK Where's Mister Seven? 
__label__KIRK Name it. 
__label__KIRK We served together. 
__label__KIRK Yes, she is. And you've been out of circulation quite a while.
__label__KIRK McCoy. 
__label__KIRK I'm the Captain. 
__label__KIRK Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, give us maximum shielding. 
__label__KIRK Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it. 
__label__KIRK I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship. 
__label__KIRK Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the plant analysis? 
__label__KIRK That unit was my Chief Engineer. (silence) Lieutenant.
__label__KIRK Engineering. 
__label__KIRK You're going to take us there. (the two men are terrified at the prospect) Spock, call the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended. 
__label__KIRK Intelligent? 
__label__KIRK Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty years ago. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please, do not come any closer to our ship. 
__label__KIRK Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen. I've got to find out what's happening out there. 
__label__KIRK Kang! Kang, this is Captain Kirk. 
__label__KIRK We came for John Gill. 
__label__KIRK (dictating into PADD) The Enterprise is heading out of our galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship.
__label__KIRK And we are definitely on the inside. 
__label__KIRK Are there others on this planet? 
__label__KIRK Can't you make other arrangements? 
__label__KIRK Can't we do something? 
__label__KIRK Did you hear them? 
__label__KIRK What do you think you're doing?
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK No, I think you and I can handle it. Why don't you beam up now? 
__label__KIRK Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at the same time. Scotty. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK I only want to talk to you. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Korby? Doctor Korby. It's possible we may have hit the wrong entry point. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock, second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson. 
__label__KIRK What's going on? 
__label__KIRK They what? 
__label__KIRK Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up. 
__label__KIRK No, we're from outside your world. 
__label__KIRK And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato? 
__label__KIRK Don't move! 
__label__KIRK Repeat it. 
__label__KIRK Watch his mouth. 
__label__KIRK All right! Whatever you're doing, turn it off! You win! 
__label__KIRK What's the problem? 
__label__KIRK It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago.
__label__KIRK How's it coming, Spock? 
__label__KIRK The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails.
__label__KIRK When did you realise that? Today? 
__label__KIRK Time we faced the unpleasant facts. 
__label__KIRK Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready? 
__label__KIRK Stop it. Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it!
__label__KIRK This is a vial of Orientine acid, Winston. It will burn through almost anything but this crystal. If you've never seen it work, I'll demonstrate on you. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK We've got serious trouble with the main computer. We have reason to believe it's kidnapped three of our crew. 
__label__KIRK (into intercom) Kirk to transporter control. One to beam down to the planet Gideon. 
__label__KIRK (going to Spock's station) Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual. 
__label__KIRK Scotty? 
__label__KIRK How will the death of our friend serve this purpose? 
__label__KIRK Now, that's just lovely. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Odona, I have to. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps you've heard, let's say, an impossible story or a rumour of men who came from the sky or from other worlds. 
__label__KIRK Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen? 
__label__KIRK Contact established with Doctor Korby. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps. 
__label__KIRK Start scanning. Let's find that alien. 
__label__KIRK And Spock is her rival. Is that any better? Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy. 
__label__KIRK You mean nobody's ever told you that before? well, er, beautiful is, Beautiful. (he holds up the tray so she can see her reflection)
__label__KIRK Good work, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Spock, you're the expert. Can you detonate the warhead from this computer? 
__label__KIRK I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me. Do your job with her. How long before he's on his feet? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, you've got to remember. 
__label__KIRK And you can bet those Romulan ships will be gunning for us. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be true. (humming noise) 
__label__KIRK You were alive then? 
__label__KIRK Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out. 
__label__KIRK Sit down. The crystals certainly aren't here. There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet. Obviously some connection.
__label__KIRK Then I would say proceed. 
__label__KIRK Please. 
__label__KIRK We found John Gill. At least, we've seen him. He may be drugged, hypnotised, or psychotic. You'll have to make a determination. Hurry with that uniform. 
__label__KIRK Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment? 
__label__KIRK Depends. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mister Khan. This is a social occasion. 
__label__KIRK Inform me when transport is complete. 
__label__KIRK Navigation.
__label__KIRK Nothing. Our next injection will renovate me. Do not be concerned. 
__label__KIRK That's no answer. 
__label__KIRK Agmar, we don't want to hurt you, but we must have Spock back. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Phaser guns, stand by to fire. 
__label__KIRK Opinion, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Maintain hailing. 
__label__KIRK On my way. 
__label__KIRK They do have bodies, or did have. 
__label__KIRK Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to lose her.
__label__KIRK I've found them. Can you still hear me? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Oh? 
__label__KIRK Everyone ready to transport? 
__label__KIRK Until we can find out what this is all about. 
__label__KIRK He said there's always that possibility. And that's not like Bones at all. Come on. 
__label__KIRK Engineering? 
__label__KIRK Magnification ten, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK If I can see him, there may be a way of stopping this insanity. 
__label__KIRK Spock, don't you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks? 
__label__KIRK Force field is on. Good. Remain here out of sight until I give the order to join me. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Haven't you found a thing yet? 
__label__KIRK McCoy! Leonard McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Trelane! Everyone, we're getting out of here. Now. This is the Captain. Commence beaming up. Maximum speed. 
__label__KIRK There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to introduce yourself. 
__label__KIRK Have you tried an escape? 
__label__KIRK Main screen projection. 
__label__KIRK How? There isn't a mark on his body. 
__label__KIRK No one may kill a man. Not for any purpose. It cannot be condoned. 
__label__KIRK But would we have made the error? 
__label__KIRK I don't follow you. 
__label__KIRK I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used against the creature. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott and I will stay here, but beam the damage control party aboard. 
__label__KIRK Maybe a stronger shot. 
__label__KIRK Follow me. 
__label__KIRK Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by) 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Damage report, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK No, but I'll avoid killing Spock. 
__label__KIRK We're reading it, Lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel. 
__label__KIRK Dead. 
__label__KIRK I'll tell you what you found. Nothing, right?
__label__KIRK You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus. How do you know about them? 
__label__KIRK No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him understand. I never had a more difficult task. 
__label__KIRK Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Yeoman. 
__label__KIRK Put it on, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Secrets of the temple. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister Spock's tirade. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good  ADAMS: Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Come on, Bones. 
__label__KIRK All right. Did the Platonians always have this power? 
__label__KIRK What was he doing? 
__label__KIRK Stabbed over and over again. 
__label__KIRK Lock onto us. Three beaming up. 
__label__KIRK Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field. 
__label__KIRK But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities. It'd be a miracle if they had developed it. 
__label__KIRK Bones, what's troubling you with the girl? 
__label__KIRK I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation and weaponry is frozen, and why the Enterprise is locked in orbit. 
__label__KIRK So, they've broken the treaty. 
__label__KIRK That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg. 
__label__KIRK Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it! 
__label__KIRK Do your best. 
__label__KIRK Put it on visual, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Anti-power. 
__label__KIRK Computer. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Code one, two, three continuity. Abort destruct order. Repeat code one, two, three continuity. Abort destruct order. 
__label__KIRK Stop. Give list. 
__label__KIRK You can talk plainer than that. 
__label__KIRK Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans? 
__label__KIRK You must save the life of our friend. 
__label__KIRK There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us? 
__label__KIRK This is the largest land mass on the planet, isn't it, Spock? 
__label__KIRK A pet? Well, that wouldn't mean much in the course of time. 
__label__KIRK A Horta. A Horta! Mister Spock, we need that retardation mechanism. You must re-establish communications with it. 
__label__KIRK Emergency power to tractor beams. Bridge to Transporter room.
__label__KIRK Absolutely. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him down. Stay in constant touch with us. Give him your phaser. He'll need that, too. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay. To the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man and a woman. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK Opinion, Mister Walking Bear. 
__label__KIRK Some more Antarean brandy? (seeing her far-away look) What is it?
__label__KIRK Yes. Nomad, you will go with these units. (the two red-shirts)
__label__KIRK This is crazy. Our own computer's declared war on us and I haven't the slightest idea why. 
__label__KIRK (shows Chekov the packet of wheat) Mister Chekov, what do you make of this? 
__label__KIRK All right. We might later. In the meantime, would you mind leaving us? 
__label__KIRK Full astern! Emergency warp speed! 
__label__KIRK It's entirely up to you. 
__label__KIRK Yes, well, I don't make those decisions. Mister Lurry is in charge of those matters. 
__label__KIRK I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology. 
__label__KIRK Go on, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Your modesty is unnecessary, Mrs. April. Your achievements as a pioneer doctor in space are well known. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Engineering, this is the Captain. Cut power on port side except for phaser banks. At my signal, cut starboard power. Kirk out. Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Spock, I'll get the cloaking device. Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention? 
__label__KIRK Good. Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload? 
__label__KIRK Our pleasure, Chief. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK There are no such things as witches! 
__label__KIRK The devil with the Providers. 
__label__KIRK You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are you from?
__label__KIRK Stop. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor. 
__label__KIRK Increase deflector shields to maximum. 
__label__KIRK What are they? 
__label__KIRK Give me your hand. Your hand. (she does) Now feel that. Human flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it, Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies. Do you understand me? 
__label__KIRK Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK And we know you. 
__label__KIRK Tyree. Some of his men. Cure. 
__label__KIRK Got something? 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Companion, do you love the man? 
__label__KIRK That fits in with other disturbances. Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble you're having with the antimatter pods? 
__label__KIRK That unit, Scotty, status report. 
__label__KIRK Where is here? 
__label__KIRK I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick.
__label__KIRK But a fascinating one, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest. Maybe he can provide some answers. 
__label__KIRK Then how did you get here? 
__label__KIRK Seal off the area, Ensign. You know the law about transporting animals proven harmful. 
__label__KIRK All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881. The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here. 
__label__KIRK Do you gentlemen have any further questions? 
__label__KIRK What other one? 
__label__KIRK We're not going anywhere. 
__label__KIRK Bones! 
__label__KIRK What happened, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on. 
__label__KIRK Perfectly all right. Can you get a fix on us.
__label__KIRK Bring the prisoner to the bridge. Deflectors on. Red Alert.
__label__KIRK Put that away. Landru, listen to me. 
__label__KIRK To report? 
__label__KIRK Can she talk? 
__label__KIRK If we can't persuade you, there is someone who can. You'll have to take this up with Kollos. For your own sake. 
__label__KIRK You won't have long to wait. 
__label__KIRK What's the matter with me? 
__label__KIRK (seeing an older woman than McCoy does) Mrs. Crater. I've heard a great deal about you. 
__label__KIRK Energise. Any incoming cargo?
__label__KIRK I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back. 
__label__KIRK Who? 
__label__KIRK Spock, what is the logic in letting a man die for the sake of creating his duplicate? Explain it to me, sir. Explain it to me. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK With all due gratitude. 
__label__KIRK A little one. A very small one. It's better than Triacus, isn't it? 
__label__KIRK Your scientists induced these mutations? 
__label__KIRK Prepare to warp us out. 
__label__KIRK I trusted you. 
__label__KIRK Come on, Bones. What's the mystery? 
__label__KIRK It will work, or he'd still be gloating. Bring the robot ships in from two different angles, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and back. 
__label__KIRK No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening. 
__label__KIRK Hail the Fuhrer. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov. If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing? 
__label__KIRK They'll be forced to accept it. 
__label__KIRK Is this your utopia, your grand vision of the future? You don't even (screams) 
__label__KIRK Oh. Well. However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester.
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty? What else? 
__label__KIRK I didn't think you'd even talk to me. 
__label__KIRK We'd have killed each other. 
__label__KIRK What is it now? 
__label__KIRK All right. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Star readings? 
__label__KIRK Andrea, kiss me. (she does, then raises her arm to slap him. He stops her and pulls her in for a passionate embrace)
__label__KIRK This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on board starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh. Start computer. 
__label__KIRK Did you hear something? 
__label__KIRK And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out. 
__label__KIRK Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos. 
__label__KIRK Can he do it? 
__label__KIRK I'm on my way.  
__label__KIRK Your hat. 
__label__KIRK Everything. 
__label__KIRK Jamie. 
__label__KIRK Then what kills a healthy man  MCCOY: I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I can't find anything wrong with him. According to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here. I don't know. I'll have the tests double-checked. My eyes may be tricking me. I swear, Jim, when I first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago. Granted, for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze. 
__label__KIRK Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the Constellation. Matt Decker's in command. What could have happened to him? 
__label__KIRK That's right. You can step off the transporter  CHRISTOPHER: Captain John Christopher, United States Air Force. Serial number 4857932. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it. 
__label__KIRK Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard. 
__label__KIRK Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation. 
__label__KIRK A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed. 
__label__KIRK What happened? Fill me in. 
__label__KIRK And judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is the result of a very dramatic conflict. Spock? 
__label__KIRK Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK I understand. Landru. 
__label__KIRK Easy. Easy.
__label__KIRK Oh. 
__label__KIRK A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare. That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
__label__KIRK Yes, the organisers, the managers. The leader of your people. 
__label__KIRK Set directional controls for Starbase Four.
__label__KIRK I panicked. 
__label__KIRK Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock, you come with me. Scotty, you too. 
__label__KIRK Dig! 
__label__KIRK Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel  SPOCK: If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. 
__label__KIRK Well, well, well. You're all having such a good time, I think I'll join you. Is that all right? 
__label__KIRK The same thing, not the zone itself? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, you're re-hired. As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down. Kirk out. Chekov, Bones. Let those people go. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Spock, Lindstrom. Doc. 
__label__KIRK Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK (quietly) Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a computer. It's talking to him. 
__label__KIRK No doubt. 
__label__KIRK Very good. Time, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK Your prognosis, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK I can't let you risk it, Mister President. 
__label__KIRK Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the Intrepid? 
__label__KIRK You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK A kink in my back. (behind his back the Yeoman starts to massage it) That's it. A little higher, please. Push. Push hard. Dig it in there, Mister  (Spock steps forward and Kirk realises who is massaging his lower back)
__label__KIRK Clear out of the area. Inform Starfleet Command. Enterprise?
__label__KIRK I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for a while. 
__label__KIRK Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing. 
__label__KIRK Yes, they can. 
__label__KIRK Put it on ship's speaker. 
__label__KIRK No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an agreement.
__label__KIRK The rules. If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be able to help  CLAUDIUS: We believe men should fight their own battles. Only the weak will die. My word as a Roman. Ready to order your men down, Captain? 
__label__KIRK Who die when they enter adolescence. 
__label__KIRK It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna.
__label__KIRK It's regaining consciousness. Surface, Mister Clayton. 
__label__KIRK We're not leaving until McCoy is released. 
__label__KIRK Open hailing frequencies. Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. You are violating Federation space. Identify yourself. Stop firing on scout ship. 
__label__KIRK No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Let's go, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Go. 
__label__KIRK I see it. I see it. Keep going. 
__label__KIRK What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research immediately. I want the answers, and I want the remedy. Let's start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected. 
__label__KIRK Yes, not happy at all. 
__label__KIRK Not me, Mister Earp. 
__label__KIRK Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death. 
__label__KIRK Tommy, Just a moment. I'd like to ask you a question. Come and sit down. Tommy, will you tell me what you saw? 
__label__KIRK Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course. 
__label__KIRK I've, I've never felt this way before. At odds with the ship. I sat there and watched my ship perform for a mass of circuits and relays, and felt useless. Unneeded. To Captain Dunsel. 
__label__KIRK If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet.
__label__KIRK A slingshot effect to yank us out of orbit. Can you compute it in your mind? If we try to use ship's computers  SPOCK: The alien will know. I believe I can, Captain. I will need to aid Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Explain, Spock. 
__label__KIRK It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler. 
__label__KIRK You heard that, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the human brain, but it can't make a value judgment. It hasn't intuition.
__label__KIRK Come on, Spock. Where's that Vulcan sense of humour? 
__label__KIRK Body armour, nuclear weapons. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? Find something? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Korby was never here.
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK In the meantime, I'm afraid I'll have to keep you under guard. I think we've had enough of that little trick. 
__label__KIRK Recommendations, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Let us take you with us to a place of safety. 
__label__KIRK War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons. 
__label__KIRK What was that? Lieutenant, cut off that frequency. 
__label__KIRK Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four. 
__label__KIRK Then what is it? 
__label__KIRK Hunting's good. We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump them outside. 
__label__KIRK Interesting? 
__label__KIRK It would seem so. Commodore, this is my problem. I'd appreciate it if no one left the bridge. 
__label__KIRK The whole galaxy controlled by your kind? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. Enterprise standing by, Commodore. 
__label__KIRK Who did? 
__label__KIRK All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye. 
__label__KIRK For how long? 
__label__KIRK Not to us. But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part. Suppose they weren't simply hiding. Suppose they're sensitive to light. Light, like in a sun, close up. 
__label__KIRK Well, in that case, we'll stay. 
__label__KIRK Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never dreamed possible. Scotty, engineering advances. Vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts. 
__label__KIRK I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?
__label__KIRK And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Stand by to get out of there, Ben. 
__label__KIRK I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock. John Gill, your Fuhrer, was sent here by the Federation as a cultural observer. 
__label__KIRK I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to decode. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. (picks up the twisted and melted weapon) Very impressive.
__label__KIRK That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room.
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here. Let's get back to the ship. I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder. And I am going to question those children.
__label__KIRK Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can.
__label__KIRK Do you feel any different? 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance.
__label__KIRK Wrong again, Oxmyx. 
__label__KIRK That'll take some explaining, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Activate life-support belts. Energise. 
__label__KIRK Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you? 
__label__KIRK Are you a slave, Flavius? 
__label__KIRK Come. 
__label__KIRK I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out.
__label__KIRK Then we've got to distract him and give Spock some time. Bones, what would happen if we pulled the cables on some of these cages. 
__label__KIRK We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles. Their weapon takes all their energy. They must become visible in order to launch it. 
__label__KIRK I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! (leaps up with cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat)
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Get those men aboard fast. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, tractor beams? 
__label__KIRK What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders on this subject are precise and inviolable. No act, no provocation  [Engineering]
__label__KIRK By who? And why? And why these particular things?
__label__KIRK Maybe we do. (he gets the wand) Sylvia, I have the transmuter.
__label__KIRK You'd make a splendid computer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK What are you doing here? Where's Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Apparently you have a few things to learn about us. Detain them in the crew lounge.
__label__KIRK Everybody back out slowly. Don't make any sudden moves. Think calm. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, send a security team to the pressure doors on the hangar deck. 
__label__KIRK If this doesn't work. 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Who are you? Why did you bring us here? 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us. Let's go. Any word comes through from Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately. Communications, priority one.
__label__KIRK (into intercom) Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can deliver. Keep at it until we begin to shake apart. Kirk out. I believe I know where it's going. 
__label__KIRK I'm on deck five, near my quarters. I've been attacked by an Andorian. Security. Security team. 
__label__KIRK But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing?
__label__KIRK I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK I can't even get at it. He'd be on me in a moment. (the woman is awake again) Keep talking, Spock. Don't let me doze off. 
__label__KIRK You want to kill me? 
__label__KIRK Does the transporter work at all? 
__label__KIRK Come on, Bones.
__label__KIRK Why? For what reason? Why all the mumbo-jumbo? 
__label__KIRK Target, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Good. Scanners? 
__label__KIRK Make it fast, Ben. I may have to go to Red Alert. 
__label__KIRK Yes, sir, there was.  COGLEY: Please tell us about it. 
__label__KIRK But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty. I should be punished. 
__label__KIRK How is our course, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK And you? 
__label__KIRK Try and cut that thing off. 
__label__KIRK There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must you survive by murder? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Yes, that's right. That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened. We can change it. Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming? 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK It is. 
__label__KIRK There must be something to do, something I've overlooked.
__label__KIRK Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake. 
__label__KIRK Keep calm. 
__label__KIRK Matt. Matt, listen to me. You can't throw your life away like this. Matt, you're a starship commander. That makes you a valuable commodity. 
__label__KIRK From where? Can you trace it? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, can you hear me? 
__label__KIRK How old is this thing? 
__label__KIRK Bridge. Captain to Bridge.
__label__KIRK Let's go, Bones. You in good voice? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up. 
__label__KIRK Get to your post. Run today's communication from Starfleet Command. I want to know my exact orders and options, if any. 
__label__KIRK I'll be right there. Kirk out. Scotty, ride herd on it. Kind words. Tender, loving care. Kiss it. Baby it. Flatter it if you have to, but keep it going. 
__label__KIRK Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose. 
__label__KIRK Is that a threat? 
__label__KIRK I've joined you. I understand now. 
__label__KIRK Ruth? Ruth.
__label__KIRK You haven't told me. You haven't told me  RUTH: Do what you have to do, and I'll be waiting.
__label__KIRK How much older was your husband than you? 
__label__KIRK You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good table. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Check it. 
__label__KIRK We will level your planet and take what we want. That is destruction. You will die as a race. 
__label__KIRK Evaluation, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Battle stations. All decks to battle stations. This is not a drill. All decks to battle stations. 
__label__KIRK All hands, this is the captain. We're going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think.
__label__KIRK It's also keeping you prisoner. 
__label__KIRK Yes, the Controller. The Controller. Who controls? I would like to meet, to see him. 
__label__KIRK Try these. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Karla Five. We'll burn to a crisp or escape into our own universe. Either way, you'll never hear from us again. Thank you for the sacrifice of your vessel. 
__label__KIRK But it shouldn't have destroyed anything. There might just as easily have been a crew aboard that ship. 
__label__KIRK Khan. Nothing else? 
__label__KIRK Turn the ship around. We're going home.  
__label__KIRK I see. You mean, we're the bait. 
__label__KIRK Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the room. Doctor Adams explained  [Sickbay]
__label__KIRK Check circuits for malfunctions. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women? 
__label__KIRK This expedition should be a geologist's dream, Mister D'Amato. 
__label__KIRK Your report said he was quite talkative.
__label__KIRK Bob. Is the evacuation proceeding? 
__label__KIRK It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK And so are your people, Miramanee. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Galway, assume your position. Start your duties. 
__label__KIRK Out of the question. 
__label__KIRK No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities. 
__label__KIRK Everything that is in error must be sterilised. 
__label__KIRK That's the way it was in 1881. 
__label__KIRK Just stay where you are, Commander. 
__label__KIRK In the cave, on the planet. On Triacus. 
__label__KIRK We'll be right there. 
__label__KIRK We can convert to it, sir. 
__label__KIRK Trelane, let him go. 
__label__KIRK What co-ordinates? 
__label__KIRK If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun! 
__label__KIRK Reduce speed to warp factor two, Mister Walking Bear. 
__label__KIRK You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever. At each other's throats throughout time. 
__label__KIRK Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot? 
__label__KIRK We'll discuss it later. Mister Sulu, lay in a course for home.
__label__KIRK Good. Now, Mister Spock  SPOCK: One moment, sir. Commodore. I believe you are scheduled for medical examination. Mister Montgomery. 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course he's an alien. 
__label__KIRK Good. Mister DePaul. 
__label__KIRK It takes too long to explain. Any place will do. 
__label__KIRK I've come for one purpose. To get back my ship. 
__label__KIRK I will not surrender my ship. 
__label__KIRK In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you?
__label__KIRK Then we'll both die. 
__label__KIRK The commander? 
__label__KIRK Try to contact her, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK This isn't the time. Companion, what you offer us is not continuation. It is non=existence. We will cease to exist. Even the man will cease to exist. 
__label__KIRK I do not know about Luma, but you were on the Enterprise. I saw you. 
__label__KIRK Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura.
__label__KIRK What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel? 
__label__KIRK That's useful. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK The male population of the Federation. Didn't someone try and talk you out of it? 
__label__KIRK I'll take the one on the left. Fire. 
__label__KIRK We've got to get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. Nothing to report, Doctor. We haven't located Mrs. Crater. What's the matter, can't you sleep? 
__label__KIRK We came to put you back. Where are you? 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK (enters turbolift) Bridge.
__label__KIRK No, we are stronger. I'll prove it to you. Can you harm a man that you're programmed to serve? 
__label__KIRK Uhura, see if you can get a playback of the log. I want to know what happened here. Nurse, attend to the wounded. 
__label__KIRK I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in. It's unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a galaxy away. What are the odds on such duplication? 
__label__KIRK You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on.
__label__KIRK Rad. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here.
__label__KIRK Are we out of range, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source? 
__label__KIRK Security, put them both in the brig. 
__label__KIRK I did not create perfection. I created error. 
__label__KIRK The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of this star sector when it disappeared. 
__label__KIRK That's quite a while. Longer than I expected. 
__label__KIRK Will she live? 
__label__KIRK Dimensional visions. Any idea what's causing them, Spock? 
__label__KIRK It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect. 
__label__KIRK How are you doing? 
__label__KIRK Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option.
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth without taking into account the time differential. Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all knowledgeable. He makes mistakes. 
__label__KIRK Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK We'll do the walking, Scotty. You get on the antimatter pod. If it gets worse, let me know, we'll beam up. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Mister Kyle, programme fuse for seven minute delay. All non-essential systems on standby. Communications, scanning, conserve every bit of power. We must make it through the membrane before that thing explodes. Make it work, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK But it follows a definite pattern, a systematic progression from planet to planet. 
__label__KIRK Repeat, the ship is off course and out of our control. 
__label__KIRK All available power  [Engineering]
__label__KIRK Radio tubes and so on. I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK How far are the ruins, Rila? 
__label__KIRK Beam us up. 
__label__KIRK Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I want navigational control restored, my ship released. 
__label__KIRK Just their uniforms left. 
__label__KIRK Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? Why did you bring us here? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, if you have a fix. (guns are pointed at his head) Stand by, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm aware of that. If we could only win its confidence.
__label__KIRK Destroyed it? It was your only hope. 
__label__KIRK If they're not there, Commissioner, then they're dead by now. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, how much time do we have left at one hundred percent impulse power? 
__label__KIRK What is the Teacher? 
__label__KIRK Extend your arm, Mister Jaris. 
__label__KIRK Not now, Leslie. Lieutenant, contact the space station. 
__label__KIRK I beg your pardon? 
__label__KIRK Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can shield themselves. 
__label__KIRK Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred and forty three miles above the surface of this planet. 
__label__KIRK She's ten years younger than I am, and she looks,  MCCOY: People age normally at different speeds, Jim. 
__label__KIRK Bones, what have you got for a headache? 
__label__KIRK Spock, we'll have you out in a minute. 
__label__KIRK Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? Who is Trelane? 
__label__KIRK I tell you it can't continue. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
__label__KIRK Answer me. 
__label__KIRK To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK How does Marlena want to fit in? 
__label__KIRK Circumstances were different then, Surak. 
__label__KIRK You sound like my first officer. 
__label__KIRK All right. Work on Bones. See if you can't  LAWGIVER: Come. 
__label__KIRK My nephew? 
__label__KIRK Transport it back out. 
__label__KIRK Engineering, report. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to him except the girl. 
__label__KIRK Helen. Helen, for years I've loved you. Helen. 
__label__KIRK Bones. Disengage the computer. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the space station. Come along, Doctor Daystrom, M-5 is out of a job.
__label__KIRK Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area. 
__label__KIRK Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct orders. 
__label__KIRK How much have you learned? 
__label__KIRK Have you seen clothes like this before? 
__label__KIRK Because we have minds, we can't be what you wanted us to be. If we fail or succeed, it has to be our own doing. Intelligent life is too precious a thing to be led by the nose. 
__label__KIRK Read out, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta Six wants their supplies. Let's get across this void in a hurry. 
__label__KIRK Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now? 
__label__KIRK That's no malfunction. 
__label__KIRK Not really. 
__label__KIRK And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans. 
__label__KIRK The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers. 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK Into one giant forward thrust  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK Uhura  LINCOLN [on viewscreen]: No need to check your voice telegraph device.
__label__KIRK Parallel course. 
__label__KIRK You take a lot of chances, Councilman. 
__label__KIRK Go to the devil. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer. You know everything about that ship there is to know. More than the men who designed it. If you can't get those warp engines working  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK What about the drug? 
__label__KIRK It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system? 
__label__KIRK Yes, yes, that sounds likely. 
__label__KIRK The computer tie-in. You spoke to it before. It knows you. 
__label__KIRK According to their lot, they beamed down six weeks ago. 
__label__KIRK Whose engrams? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus.
__label__KIRK How can you destroy others and not me? 
__label__KIRK Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.
__label__KIRK But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better officer in return.
__label__KIRK What display case? 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, what is it? What's wrong? Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. You'll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or,  (He starts convulsing, and Janice is doing the same in the brig) 
__label__KIRK They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation. 
__label__KIRK Spock is right as usual, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK North east. That's where we got the signal from. All right, Scotty, keep scanning. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Prepare to verify destruct sequence code one. Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things. If we could prove to them they could do something to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance. 
__label__KIRK Report, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Try another channel, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to. 
__label__KIRK Analysis, quickly. 
__label__KIRK It was our last chance. 
__label__KIRK Maybe we can beam him out of there. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. This isn't my communicator. 
__label__KIRK Are you mad? I can't just  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need anything? 
__label__KIRK If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My concern is with the ship and the crew. 
__label__KIRK What's that? 
__label__KIRK Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you? 
__label__KIRK Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it deadly? 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK Well, at least we found them. 
__label__KIRK Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him. Here we go, Sam. 
__label__KIRK I don't know, but something or someone did.
__label__KIRK You've seen some kind of creature? Any alien form? 
__label__KIRK The problem, to get in. 
__label__KIRK It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We can't even get at them.
__label__KIRK Good. The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerable.
__label__KIRK How did Riley get in there?
__label__KIRK Spock, we don't have time for that. 
__label__KIRK Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once. 
__label__KIRK Kirk of the starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Materialisation completed. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, how you doing? 
__label__KIRK Full reverse thrust. 
__label__KIRK Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey.
__label__KIRK Love? Him? I love the life he led. The power of a starship commander. It's my life now. 
__label__KIRK What's the matter? 
__label__KIRK She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another?
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott.  CHEKOV: And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean they had to. 
__label__KIRK If it works. 
__label__KIRK If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken? 
__label__KIRK Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships.
__label__KIRK That would account for the tunnels. 
__label__KIRK Manual controls. 
__label__KIRK Take him. 
__label__KIRK What about the detonator? 
__label__KIRK We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK It should work, yes. But any miscalculation anywhere along the way and we'll be plunging tail first into a supernova. 
__label__KIRK They've been in flight ten thousand years. Maybe they don't realise it. 
__label__KIRK And you'd prefer to keep him here until I complete my investigation anyway.
__label__KIRK About what? 
__label__KIRK Will you take me there? 
__label__KIRK Help it. Treat it. 
__label__KIRK We'll do what we can. 
__label__KIRK We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven. 
__label__KIRK What about Landru? Who is he? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we haven't got much time left.
__label__KIRK One of our people? 
__label__KIRK Who are the inhabitants of this planet? 
__label__KIRK No. They're like the dragons on Maravel. The stun charge should get them. 
__label__KIRK A changeling. 
__label__KIRK Do they tie in? 
__label__KIRK Fair? (leaves) 
__label__KIRK You've located the controls? 
__label__KIRK It seems to be waiting. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes. 
__label__KIRK In Doctor Adams' study, Mister Spock. Why? 
__label__KIRK One moment, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu, on my command, I want you to turn the Enterprise and head for the exact co-ordinates where the Klingon ship disappeared. Warp eight. 
__label__KIRK Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister Spock. Ahead warp factor one.
__label__KIRK Eve? 
__label__KIRK You do it, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Put up our present position, Lieutenant Arex. 
__label__KIRK I'd like those answers now. First, the purpose of your star flight. 
__label__KIRK We need him. Override the controls and shut those doors. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Let's find out. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure you're all right? 
__label__KIRK Implement. 
__label__KIRK Will he make it? 
__label__KIRK Bones, you did it! 
__label__KIRK Scotty, Bones. (and it's all the way around.) We're trapped. They got their way. We've got to stand and fight. 
__label__KIRK That head injury. Think, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK I'm losing command. I'm losing the Enterprise. The ship is sailing on and on. I'm alone. Alone. Alone. I'm losing command. 
__label__KIRK All hands. 
__label__KIRK How long to Starbase Two? 
__label__KIRK That's John Gill. The Fuhrer? 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years. 
__label__KIRK Spock! Spock! (He pulls it off) It's gone. Can you stand? Spock, are you all right?
__label__KIRK Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with the Horta again. Tell her our proposition. She and her children can do all the tunnelling they want. Our people will remove the minerals, and each side will leave the other alone. Think she'll go for it? 
__label__KIRK Contact Starfleet. Inform them the Federation mining rights on Capella have been secured by treaty, documents signed by the young high chief's regent. Report follows. 
__label__KIRK No, I don't think I've for  SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
__label__KIRK Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? Robes. 
__label__KIRK We'll all go. 
__label__KIRK You mean they're actually draining our life forces? 
__label__KIRK My muscles are sore, that's all. 
__label__KIRK Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you. Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine. 
__label__KIRK Acknowledge. This is the captain. Scotty, acknowledge.
__label__KIRK Stand by. We're not leaving without Bem. He is our responsibility. We can't leave him here. Beam down a security squad with heavy duty tricorders set for Pandronian scanning. 
__label__KIRK No choice, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK They don't look like the trusting type. 
__label__KIRK I do, sir. 
__label__KIRK It was set for cordrazine. 
__label__KIRK Present condition of Psi 2000.
__label__KIRK I don't understand what's going on here. This goes against every principle that John Gill ever believed in. Our only chance is to see him, and quickly. 
__label__KIRK I'll get out of his way. 
__label__KIRK I've noticed something else. 
__label__KIRK You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu! Sulu! 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher. 
__label__KIRK What happened to your crew? 
__label__KIRK They'll still come. 
__label__KIRK He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't get in here and talk to me. 
__label__KIRK Where is the brain located? 
__label__KIRK Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you? 
__label__KIRK Our race has another name for it. Slavery. This collar of obedience, is Galt the only one who can operate it? 
__label__KIRK If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell where this ship used to be. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Lieutenant. Bones? 
__label__KIRK It's a small ship. 
__label__KIRK A love philter? 
__label__KIRK Bones, what is it? Answer me! 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, contact the Halkan council. I wish to talk to them again. 
__label__KIRK What did you do? 
__label__KIRK They hooked something into the life support system. They're in there. We've got to get rid of it. 
__label__KIRK Now then, Mister Hengist  (But Hengist tries to make a break for it, even landing a very good kick on Kirk, who repays him with an even better right cross. Hengist falls to the floor.) 
__label__KIRK And if this thing does have a stomach, we just might be able to give it enough indigestion to make it turn away from Mantilles. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK We will not argue. Twelve hours. No more. Close communications.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy. 
__label__KIRK What are you talking about? Where have they taken Spock? 
__label__KIRK Miranda. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture. Kirk to Spock. 
__label__KIRK Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching. 
__label__KIRK I'm beginning to get the idea. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, report. 
__label__KIRK He's gone. 
__label__KIRK Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler. 
__label__KIRK I said talk with her, not fight with her. 
__label__KIRK Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. I understand. 
__label__KIRK If I guess wrong, Mister Spock is dead. Spock will die.
__label__KIRK Sulu!
__label__KIRK And that we would use it to escape. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. Beam me up. 
__label__KIRK Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids? 
__label__KIRK How do you feel, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. 
__label__KIRK The atmosphere is thinner than Earth. 
__label__KIRK Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed? 
__label__KIRK I don't know, Bones. We're here to find out what's happened because I don't know. 
__label__KIRK Mister Jones, you are in enough trouble already. 
__label__KIRK Get ready. 
__label__KIRK I never stopped you from going on with your space work. 
__label__KIRK We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing. If you continue, you'll kill Spock. 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't lie to you. 
__label__KIRK And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed? 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Without that mask, I haven't  VANNA: With your bare hands, Captain.
__label__KIRK You could use some sleep, Bones. 
__label__KIRK I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device. 
__label__KIRK Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity? 
__label__KIRK We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection. 
__label__KIRK (into communicator) McCoy, do you read me?
__label__KIRK Preliminary reports, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Bones? Spock? 
__label__KIRK Compton, did they accelerate you? 
__label__KIRK There's no other way, Bones. We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed. 
__label__KIRK If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said  SPOCK: That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude? 
__label__KIRK Until what is over? 
__label__KIRK (wearing the mask) We had a bargain. Why did you break it? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Those are the orders. 
__label__KIRK I'll have a dish, too. 
__label__KIRK Can you prove you went directly home? 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. Hold your fire. We have your commander aboard. 
__label__KIRK Have the department heads meet me on the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK I've got to find Janice. 
__label__KIRK You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders. My orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian customs. 
__label__KIRK Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything, but I think you'll find it interesting. 
__label__KIRK Computer control, come in.
__label__KIRK Not those last three days.
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing? 
__label__KIRK Ready phasers. 
__label__KIRK Instrument failure caused navigational error. We were across the Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back. 
__label__KIRK Check it, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved. 
__label__KIRK Uhura, why did you tell her? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK I know it's a book. 
__label__KIRK McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning. 
__label__KIRK Alert status. Force shields on maximum. Leslie, begin sensor scan. 
__label__KIRK That's only one down, Doctor. There's over four hundred more up there in orbit. And if there's a Klingon down here, there might be a Klingon ship up there somewhere. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK What did you learn? 
__label__KIRK The body is dying. You are destroying it. 
__label__KIRK No question about the trail? 
__label__KIRK I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why? 
__label__KIRK Reevaluate? 
__label__KIRK Fabrini? Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula. 
__label__KIRK Mister Darvin, are you going to talk? 
__label__KIRK We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship. They mean nothing to us. 
__label__KIRK You're here. There's nothing I can do about it. 
__label__KIRK How much time before the sun blows up? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise from Captain Kirk. Come in.
__label__KIRK We'll do our best. Start feeding us constant status reports, Scotty. Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level twenty three, checkpoint Tiger. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Tell me, Doctor Jones. Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock I can understand. Nothing makes an impression on him. 
__label__KIRK But not impossible, Mister Spock. The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won. That's the angle to work on, gentlemen. I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour. 
__label__KIRK My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it. 
__label__KIRK Maintain course to outpost four. Keep me informed. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Very good. I'll continue transmitting. Assume standard orbit when you arrive. We'll transport up in the shuttlecraft.
__label__KIRK So they keep their word scrupulously. They're unusually honest.
__label__KIRK To be killed? 
__label__KIRK Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy. 
__label__KIRK I'd like to talk to Mister, to Billy alone, if you don't mind. 
__label__KIRK That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me, because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now you're just going to take over. 
__label__KIRK And now it has control of the Enterprise and taking us out of the galaxy. But why? 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK On this planet, Bones, they seem to be the people and we are the animals. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation? 
__label__KIRK And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful. 
__label__KIRK But we don't hate you. KUKULKAN: You fired your weapons at me. 
__label__KIRK Secure from general quarters. And beam down two, and only two, security guards. Have them report to Mister Lurry.
__label__KIRK Did you say they were safe? 
__label__KIRK Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy? 
__label__KIRK We must talk to Kang, bury the hatchet. 
__label__KIRK Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog. 
__label__KIRK But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food. 
__label__KIRK But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things affect them? 
__label__KIRK I was talking about both. 
__label__KIRK Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know a little place across town where the women  MCCOY: Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Bones. Spock! 
__label__KIRK Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power. 
__label__KIRK Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__KIRK This is the United Spaceship Enterprise. I'm Captain Kirk, commanding. 
__label__KIRK Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
__label__KIRK Add to that a simple diet, a perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed. Maybe it is paradise after all. 
__label__KIRK You mean he just simply died. 
__label__KIRK Why not? I saw your performance today. May I extend my appreciation? 
__label__KIRK Bones, hurry with that report. Join me in the briefing room with your analysis. 
__label__KIRK We seem to have company. 
__label__KIRK Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers? 
__label__KIRK I'm curious, Doctor. Why is it called M-5 and not M-1? 
__label__KIRK On my way. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack. Bring the ship about now. If you bring her about  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK All right. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK I think he means it, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Jack the Ripper? 
__label__KIRK Help me. Somebody make the decision. 
__label__KIRK Can you do me a favour? 
__label__KIRK But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you destroyed. Is there life aboard? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, Sulu. Scotty. Put down the phaser. Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights. 
__label__KIRK In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency. 
__label__KIRK It's called blood. Watch your step. The officers move up by assassination. Chekov tried it on me. 
__label__KIRK I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Villi? 
__label__KIRK He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK All that bloodshed for nothing. That'll be sufficient, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No. No, no, you'd better not. Any disturbance might bring down the rest of the wall. 
__label__KIRK This planet is built like a fortress. 
__label__KIRK What would you like to know? 
__label__KIRK Why hasn't he aged? 
__label__KIRK Did your instruments show anything? 
__label__KIRK Guard, I'll talk. I'll talk. The pain  (Spock neck-pinches the guard. They start to undress him.) 
__label__KIRK Blind panic. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I feel it too, Bones. 
__label__KIRK That's what matters. 
__label__KIRK It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No, nothing in particular. Why ? 
__label__KIRK Hard about, helmsman. Change course for twenty four mark seven. 
__label__KIRK I'm responsible. Let them go. 
__label__KIRK We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock  SPOCK: Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice. 
__label__KIRK Weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead. I sent Finney into the pod.  STONE: Why Finney? 
__label__KIRK And you've got a lot to learn! 
__label__KIRK But that's impossible. 
__label__KIRK I should never have let him go. 
__label__KIRK Why don't you try your Vulcan nerve pinch. 
__label__KIRK It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK I'm tired. 
__label__KIRK Take a look around you. 
__label__KIRK Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup? 
__label__KIRK Primitive computer. I've seen them demonstrated in museums. 
__label__KIRK Is that for us, or does it need fresh air? 
__label__KIRK Did these ladies come voluntarily? 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, I'm afraid that we're not going to be able to rescue you. 
__label__KIRK Before you came here  LETHE: I was another person, malignant, hateful.
__label__KIRK It is. 
__label__KIRK Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay.
__label__KIRK Well they're there now. Let's go check them out. (to Gem) Staying here alone could be dangerous. Come with us. 
__label__KIRK Location and distance. 
__label__KIRK No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Like a door opening. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.
__label__KIRK But you left at the very time mankind needed courage. 
__label__KIRK Deploy forces to protect your section and the auxiliary control centre. 
__label__KIRK But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old. And you don't run a starship with your arms. You run it with your head. My brain's as sharp as it ever was. A simple case of radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command. I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you. 
__label__KIRK You again! 
__label__KIRK This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet? 
__label__KIRK Go. 
__label__KIRK By herself. She took no drug. 
__label__KIRK Take Cochrane up on his offer. 
__label__KIRK A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age. 
__label__KIRK An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK We're going to be late. I don't intend to leave this area until we've found the solution for this problem. 
__label__KIRK What was that? 
__label__KIRK Ben, where are you? 
__label__KIRK Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections to direct beams aft. Full function, continuous operation until further orders. 
__label__KIRK Daran Five? Inhabited? 
__label__KIRK It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system. 
__label__KIRK What's going on down there? Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double. Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel? 
__label__KIRK How did you like it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll take the other two and go the other way. That creature is dangerous. If you see it, fire full phasers. 
__label__KIRK Get him out of here.
__label__KIRK Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And food. We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years. So that should last us  ODONA: Forever. All my life I've dreamed of being alone. 
__label__KIRK Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mister Sulu. Magnification. Still nothing, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK I wasn't sure. Any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley. 
__label__KIRK Orion. 
__label__KIRK Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK So am I. 
__label__KIRK Our orders are very clear. We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK On my way.
__label__KIRK Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory. 
__label__KIRK It's all right. 
__label__KIRK There must be some defence we can use. 
__label__KIRK Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? 
__label__KIRK This thing, this cell, this virus. It's eleven thousand miles long, and it's one cell. When it grows into millions, we'll be the virus invading its body. 
__label__KIRK Vegetation, Captain. Evidently there's water nearby. 
__label__KIRK All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they look like? Where do they live? 
__label__KIRK I already have a lot of green memories. 
__label__KIRK Children. Children, listen to me. It's late and it's time to go up to the ship. 
__label__KIRK Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get that heater down. Don't you want to take a look at what you're going to fight? 
__label__KIRK Kiss. 
__label__KIRK The Lactrans outside, what do they do? 
__label__KIRK In that case, we must decline with thanks. 
__label__KIRK Not without you. 
__label__KIRK Will you be there? 
__label__KIRK Your logic can be most annoying. 
__label__KIRK All right, it's up to you. Take us to Landru. 
__label__KIRK This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves  AYELBORNE: We have already answered that question. To us, violence is unthinkable. 
__label__KIRK Then we can report back for other work? 
__label__KIRK Alexander, are there other Platonians like you? 
__label__KIRK Comments? 
__label__KIRK Yes, he did your job. 
__label__KIRK Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist. 
__label__KIRK In my land we have a tribe like you. 
__label__KIRK From warp eight? Have you lost your mind? 
__label__KIRK It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too. 
__label__KIRK If no one on Earth built this city exactly right, then that's why Kukulkan never came back. The entire city is our key. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, the intruder is in your area. 
__label__KIRK I have a feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to. 
__label__KIRK Spock, Bones, come with us. 
__label__KIRK You could. (She turns to slap him.) I simply meant that you could be anything you want to be. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we're running out of time. 
__label__KIRK They want us to lose our heads.
__label__KIRK What's that? 
__label__KIRK Areel. Doctor McCoy said you were here. I should have felt it in the air, like static electricity. 
__label__KIRK That mirror. It's part of his audience, his ego. He never wanders from it. 
__label__KIRK What does she mean, the last one? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our co-ordinates. 
__label__KIRK I'm afraid we can't reveal everything we know, Mister Seven. 
__label__KIRK But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them. 
__label__KIRK Well, gentlemen, it appears that we're on our own now. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'd say just about a sixteenth of an inch close. 
__label__KIRK Certainly. Our engineering officer  UHURA: Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two hours. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Comment? 
__label__KIRK I'm asking what you know about ESP. 
__label__KIRK Status report, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay. Mister Spock, take the ship out of orbit. Resume designated course.
__label__KIRK Spock, Scotty, come with me.
__label__KIRK We need them. 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force.
__label__KIRK All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations.
__label__KIRK Destination and purpose of journey? 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie? 
__label__KIRK What is it you want? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, we seem to have been given a choice. Death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning. 
__label__KIRK Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone. Hold our position. Play dead. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. That's what worries me. How will my crew react in a world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it.
__label__KIRK Lay in a course for Starbase Twenty One. All ahead, warp two. 
__label__KIRK Where's Mister Seven? 
__label__KIRK We're helpless down here. And the Enterprise  SPOCK: Sulu is an experienced combat officer.
__label__KIRK Then you're wasting your time. There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host. 
__label__KIRK Are we still losing power? 
__label__KIRK The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them. If and when it becomes necessary. 
__label__KIRK I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Do you smell that? A sweet odour like honey. It was years ago, on another planet. A thing with a an odour like that. 
__label__KIRK I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov.
__label__KIRK This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation business. Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference. 
__label__KIRK I'll be right up. You could see the alarm lights flashing from there, McCoy. Why didn't you tell me?
__label__KIRK We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel. 
__label__KIRK Then get on this technology. It's all we have to work with if we want to get back home. The intercom may be monitored. Use your communicators for private messages. Subfrequency and scramble. 
__label__KIRK With ulterior motives. Does that please you? 
__label__KIRK Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form. 
__label__KIRK Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?
__label__KIRK Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality. 
__label__KIRK Yes, you are. Oh, there's one more thing, Harry. We've programmed a special android attendant to take care of your every need.
__label__KIRK Frankly, Commander, what you accept is of little importance to me. Enterprise out. Now, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Bring them in. 
__label__KIRK My what? 
__label__KIRK Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left in you, give it to me.
__label__KIRK I didn't realise I was so hungry. Whatever you call this, it is very good. 
__label__KIRK I do. 
__label__KIRK Is she all right? 
__label__KIRK Elaan? 
__label__KIRK We'll board her, Mister Spock. Scotty, Bones, you'll come with us. We'll need life-support belts. Mister Sulu, have the Transporter room stand by. 
__label__KIRK Ki, Kir  ELDER: Kirok? 
__label__KIRK I could've sworn I heard you say that. Kirk here.
__label__KIRK I choose to believe they are. 
__label__KIRK Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber. 
__label__KIRK And mutual override did not work? 
__label__KIRK Who took the Soul? 
__label__KIRK Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are. 
__label__KIRK What was it they said that started the fight? 
__label__KIRK Ambassador. 
__label__KIRK I think we're due for a pick-up. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice an odour of any kind? Rizzo. Rizzo! Do you remember a sickly sweet odour? Did you smell it? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind. Get down to Engineering, pull out every hook up that makes M-5 run. Pull out the plug, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Whatever you say. What shall I do? 
__label__KIRK Come. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation? 
__label__KIRK I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp. My name is not Clanton, it's Kirk. 
__label__KIRK According to our computer files, Jones, you are in violation of three Federation mandates and forty seven local ones. You're confined until we complete our mission. Then we'll turn you over to the proper authorities. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Accidents happen. 
__label__KIRK Why were the Klingons chasing you, Jones? 
__label__KIRK This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure. Will it prevent this catastrophe? 
__label__KIRK On audio, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality. 
__label__KIRK You do that. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Come in. 
__label__KIRK Wrong assumption. 
__label__KIRK Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in Apollo's chest could have something to do with the transmission of energy? 
__label__KIRK I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you. 
__label__KIRK We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir. 
__label__KIRK A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement. 
__label__KIRK It's all right. 
__label__KIRK Return to your post and don't leave it until you've been relieved. 
__label__KIRK They're not going to hurt you. I promise you. Akuta, Akuta, we come in peace. We would like to speak to this Vaal. 
__label__KIRK From the Federation. 
__label__KIRK Tribbles don't like Klingons. That should have given you some clue. 
__label__KIRK How do you do it? 
__label__KIRK Everybody, Charlie. Me, too. 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know that. 
__label__KIRK Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?
__label__KIRK That's enough, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Sonny! 
__label__KIRK Who are you? Where do you come from? 
__label__KIRK How could that be? Unless it's powered. A spaceship? 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK It can't be helped, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK That is how you kill. You'll never reach me. 
__label__KIRK She's a very good lawyer. 
__label__KIRK Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, pass the word by sections. Shore leave is to commence immediately. 
__label__KIRK That's a course of self-destruction. Lieutenant Uhura, open hailing frequencies. I want to talk to that ship's captain. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Belay that, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK First you turn us in, then get us out. What are you doing now, waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it? 
__label__KIRK Any sensor analysis on that wavering effect just before the ship disappeared? 
__label__KIRK Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about? 
__label__KIRK Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector? 
__label__KIRK Captain Christopher, this is my First Officer, Lieutenant Commander Spock. 
__label__KIRK But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a perfect thing as you? 
__label__KIRK Key in the ignition. Turn the ignition on. And nothing happens.
__label__KIRK I was just expressing my curiosity at our ability to get into these kind of situations. 
__label__KIRK We did not destroy the Klothos, and you are well aware of it, Commander. 
__label__KIRK Then I'd better handle it. (goes over to a very satisfied looking woman) You all right? 
__label__KIRK He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know. 
__label__KIRK Go take a look. 
__label__KIRK What are you doing here? 
__label__KIRK We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One hundred percent dispersal pattern. 
__label__KIRK Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being misled. 
__label__KIRK Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry. 
__label__KIRK Very well. 
__label__KIRK The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock, as for you  SPOCK: Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you. 
__label__KIRK They did mention ecological sabotage. 
__label__KIRK In the future, Commander Bem, you will leave the operation of the transporter to Mister Scott, or one of the regular transporter crew. 
__label__KIRK The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect. 
__label__KIRK Lock all phasers on target. 
__label__KIRK Antennae? 
__label__KIRK Give us your transporter co-ordinates. We're beaming aboard. 
__label__KIRK The crew has performed excellently, but is exhausted. And I, too, am looking forward to a nice period of rest on some lovely planet. 
__label__KIRK And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam the security party down immediately. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Spock, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1?  SPOCK: 7,824.7 to 1. 
__label__KIRK Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell. Hold this position. 
__label__KIRK We can't risk it, not while they're moving. We may never be able to find them again. 
__label__KIRK None of us will do it, Galt. 
__label__KIRK Yes? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No! 
__label__KIRK Including ourselves, how many of us are there? 
__label__KIRK No! Does it still taste as sweet? 
__label__KIRK We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement. 
__label__KIRK What a trip, Bones. Orion, at the dawn of its civilisation. Even just observing, not touching anything for fear of changing some piece of history. What's the matter? Bones? 
__label__KIRK Damage control procedures, all decks. That ship out there has phasers. At least our weapons are alike. 
__label__KIRK Shift positions. 
__label__KIRK Korob, that door won't last. 
__label__KIRK And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Let's hope its tapes are intact. We'll feed it through Mister Spock's computer. 
__label__KIRK Oh. 
__label__KIRK Scan us and lock on to us. It's going to be close. Very, very close. Stand by. Stand by, Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack.
__label__KIRK Your friends out there are good. They'll have to destroy this ship to win. 
__label__KIRK My apologies, Mister Spock. You suspect some danger in them? 
__label__KIRK You were a man with respect for all things alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps his arm in a door. The skin tears to reveal electronics)
__label__KIRK You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock? 
__label__KIRK Uhura, open the channel. 
__label__KIRK Tell me about Vaal. 
__label__KIRK Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait. Two others still survive. Henoch and Thalassa. Thalassa, my Thalassa. I am pleased you survived with me. Forgive me. It has been so very long. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain speaking. There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to be observed. All crew members are to arm themselves. The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. Repeat, the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.
__label__KIRK (shivers) Oh, that's strange. That's very strange. I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place. It doesn't sound very scientific, does it? But it's strongest right here. 
__label__KIRK Start your readings. 
__label__KIRK How are they?
__label__KIRK Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean so little to you? 
__label__KIRK Mister Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging one hundred kilometres off your station. 
__label__KIRK Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your tricorders. Find the source of that power. Bones. 
__label__KIRK Where to? 
__label__KIRK I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time? 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. 
__label__KIRK How was he killed? 
__label__KIRK Neither have I. 
__label__KIRK Yes, the booth. Carry on. 
__label__KIRK Complete? 
__label__KIRK A friend. Activate the transporter. You saved us back at Sickbay with the Tantalus field. 
__label__KIRK How did you escape? 
__label__KIRK They threw me a few curves. No time to explain. 
__label__KIRK I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us. There must be a way. Odona. Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being alone? 
__label__KIRK Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding? 
__label__KIRK Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two.
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu! Sulu! 
__label__KIRK What are you saying? 
__label__KIRK You're not staying, McCoy. No matter what he tries to  (Prostrate on the floor.) 
__label__KIRK Let me try. This is Captain James T Kirk speaking. You are programmed to obey any direct order I may give, correct? 
__label__KIRK Let's get up to the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Spock, (he turns green) you're sure? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour? 
__label__KIRK Your recent behaviour. Is something wrong? 
__label__KIRK We won't be using the impulse engines. Turn the alarm off. 
__label__KIRK I guess so. 
__label__KIRK Disengage from helm.
__label__KIRK Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself! 
__label__KIRK Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years past. 
__label__KIRK Where? 
__label__KIRK Not on my ship. 
__label__KIRK Fire phasers, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now. Aim for the lab. 
__label__KIRK Ah, yes. Take care of that oversight, will you, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Don't hurt him. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute. 
__label__KIRK You've made your point, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise. From Captain Kirk. Come in. 
__label__KIRK But someday, you will want human love and companionship. 
__label__KIRK And what about us? Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface? 
__label__KIRK Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time for surprise. 
__label__KIRK I'm not joking! I'm not Ike Clanton! 
__label__KIRK Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign. 
__label__KIRK That object on the screen? 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Bones. Still orbiting Gideon. 
__label__KIRK But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative. 
__label__KIRK Of course. That laugh, it's the voice of our main computer. 
__label__KIRK Good. I'll make our apologies to our hostess. I'll meet you outside. 
__label__KIRK The skill to remove it exists right where we are. Restoring it must also be possible. That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can. 
__label__KIRK Let's find out. 
__label__KIRK Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want? 
__label__KIRK He'll be all right now. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. We have your captain as prisoner. Your choice, sir. 
__label__KIRK Recommendations. 
__label__KIRK Weaponry on the vessel, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland. 
__label__KIRK It's not too late. Sheriff. Sheriff. There must be plenty of decent people in town who don't like the Earps. Let's organise them. 
__label__KIRK I want facts, not poetry. 
__label__KIRK From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent. 
__label__KIRK With the wonders you have to offer, the galaxy will come to you. 
__label__KIRK Tranquilliser? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise. 
__label__KIRK Override systems, Mister Spock. Open the core hatch. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry. 
__label__KIRK They'll be all right. 
__label__KIRK Was your father  GARROVICK: Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that account. 
__label__KIRK By what, Commodore Stone? 
__label__KIRK Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Lead projectile. Primitive firearm. 
__label__KIRK Ready. 
__label__KIRK (flipping open the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love. 
__label__KIRK Good. I think you'll find the orbit lock is broken as well. Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary. 
__label__KIRK But if children are made totally dependent on their teachers, they will never be anything but children. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I think (an image of tiny Enterprise and the giant planet killer comes on screen) What the devil's going on? 
__label__KIRK Spock, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Where's Lieutenant Palamas? 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp. 
__label__KIRK Men, this is the pan. This is the hammer. The hammer striking the pan causes a spark, ignites the powder, and fires the flintlock. Now aim it as I showed you. Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently. (Tyree shoots the clay pot target) Well done. Very, very, very good. 
__label__KIRK I've heard that word a lot lately. Perfect.
__label__KIRK McCoy's death is a scientific fact. 
__label__KIRK Lay in that course, Sulu. Ahead warp factor seven. 
__label__KIRK Still no response, communications? 
__label__KIRK When I find the headquarters genius that assigned me a female yeoman MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim. Don't you trust yourself?
__label__KIRK What's the point of capturing my ship? Even at maximum warp, the Enterprise couldn't get to Andromeda galaxy for thousands of years. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's get him. (phaser fire) 
__label__KIRK I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane. 
__label__KIRK Captain Koloth. About that apology. 
__label__KIRK On my way.
__label__KIRK I didn't start it, Councilman, but I'm liable to finish it. 
__label__KIRK For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners. I will not go back to being Janice Lester. You must help me prevent it. 
__label__KIRK Yes, everything will be taken care of. This is Mister Spock, my First Officer. 
__label__KIRK Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero. 
__label__KIRK Release him. 
__label__KIRK I must ask you to return them. 
__label__KIRK The wheat! 
__label__KIRK I don't understand. 
__label__KIRK Very impressive. Lenore. I'd like to see you again. 
__label__KIRK What brings you to us? 
__label__KIRK But why did you Megans leave Earth? If you enjoyed it so much, I don't understand. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, can you integrate that pilot now? 
__label__KIRK Lock main phasers on that ship and open fire. 
__label__KIRK Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I read my Spocks correctly. 
__label__KIRK This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening. It calls you a liar, Lazarus. For one thing, there's no planet at the location you said you came from. There never has been. If you want help from us, you'd better start telling the truth. 
__label__KIRK Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy immediately. Oh. Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command. Due to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two. 
__label__KIRK Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK He didn't seem to know me. 
__label__KIRK Yes, from inside each expedition. Remember Spock, you were the one who said there are no life forms here except ourselves. 
__label__KIRK Do you know what you're saying? 
__label__KIRK We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle. 
__label__KIRK Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Let's go home. 
__label__KIRK All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now.
__label__KIRK Our people don't believe in slavery. 
__label__KIRK (reading) For eyes of Starfleet Command only.
__label__KIRK Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me? 
__label__KIRK All right, but he'll double over before we get very far. (Spock and Kirk take McCoy's arms.) 
__label__KIRK You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go? 
__label__KIRK Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she obviously prefers you, and you obviously don't seem to mind. If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be left alone to find the power controls of this world. 
__label__KIRK Team up with the Enterprise security personnel. They're better armed than you. Keep someone in sight at all times. Vanderberg, take two men. Go through that tunnel there. Rendezvous with Commander Giotto. Appel and the rest of the men, go through there and tie up with Lieutenant Osborne's detail. Mister Spock and I will control the operation from a central point. That's all. 
__label__KIRK Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game you're playing  ANAN: This is no game, Captain. Half a million people have just been killed. Activate the attack units, Sar. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief  MUDD: Come now. 
__label__KIRK Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK I sent the others up to the ship. What happened? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Engineering. 
__label__KIRK This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes. I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment. 
__label__KIRK The others are on the patio. 
__label__KIRK The report was premature. 
__label__KIRK The Neutral Zone? We have no authorisation to enter it. Did you order a course change, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Where are they? Tell me! You said you'd let them go! 
__label__KIRK Computer. 
__label__KIRK And Korby?
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, if you could split yourself into separate parts, why didn't you escape on your own earlier? 
__label__KIRK Beautifully done. 
__label__KIRK We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK The crew wasn't abducted, they just left.
__label__KIRK I was trying to see the Fuhrer. 
__label__KIRK No, it doesn't. 
__label__KIRK Coincidence? Maybe. 
__label__KIRK Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes.
__label__KIRK Am I addressing the Ambassador? 
__label__KIRK Standard orbit, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there.
__label__KIRK I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer. 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, prepare to move in on the Romulan vessel. Ship-to-ship, Uhura. Put this on the screen. 
__label__KIRK Daystrom, we're going to do our best. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK We've been all through that, Commander! 
__label__KIRK You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do. 
__label__KIRK I could've prevented all of it. 
__label__KIRK What thing? What was it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects. But that too was strictly under command of the women. 
__label__KIRK I told you, you wouldn't believe me. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
__label__KIRK Computer, could the described entity assume physical form? 
__label__KIRK That's your home. The planet that you come from. 
__label__KIRK No, sir, listen to me. I  GARTH: Stop! On your knees. 
__label__KIRK What distance were you from the creature? 
__label__KIRK No. Over something as simple as this? No, it'll cure itself eventually, but. Do you know, uh I don't even remember how this happened. Do you hear that? 
__label__KIRK Occasionally. 
__label__KIRK I don't understand. 
__label__KIRK Good. Mind the store, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Captain to phaser banks. All components at battle ready. All banks primed.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Gary. Gary, don't! 
__label__KIRK I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell. 
__label__KIRK Is it possible for Spock to return to Vulcan and repair the timeline that has been broken so all is the same as before? 
__label__KIRK We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we? 
__label__KIRK No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it. 
__label__KIRK Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral. Well, we're going to wait right here until well after five o'clock. We're not going to move from this spot. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Ready main phasers. 
__label__KIRK Rizzo. 
__label__KIRK Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Spock. Don't let them break you. Hold on. Don't  ALEXANDER: Parmen, they saved your life. I'm ashamed to be a Platonian.
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Landru. 
__label__KIRK Go. Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation. 
__label__KIRK Communications status. 
__label__KIRK What else? She's going to make fools of the Romulans by having them attack a balloon, and Romulans fear disgrace more than death. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good to be true. 
__label__KIRK Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it. 
__label__KIRK With regular pulsations of generated energy? 
__label__KIRK I think that could be arranged.
__label__KIRK Mister Stiles. 
__label__KIRK To us, killing is murder, even for revenge. But there will be other starships. 
__label__KIRK This mission is not for casual observers. It could be hazardous. 
__label__KIRK Helm, hard over. Phasers, fire point-blank. 
__label__KIRK You're right. Something is beaming aboard. 
__label__KIRK What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK How's Ensign Rizzo? 
__label__KIRK Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity. 
__label__KIRK I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was nothing there. And it's just happened again. Could I be imagining it? 
__label__KIRK Care to speculate on what we'll find if we go on ahead?
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so charged. The sentence, death. Mister Lemli. 
__label__KIRK Communications, emergency medical team. 
__label__KIRK You mean you know who's behind these stunts? 
__label__KIRK Captain here. 
__label__KIRK Are you all right, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Spock, the macroscope. (viewing the tiny people) Mendant, we welcome your people aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Yes, sir. 
__label__KIRK Who sent you? 
__label__KIRK Any new information, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Go to full magnification. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, energise. Scotty, what's the matter? 
__label__KIRK I'm a barbarian. You said it yourself. 
__label__KIRK Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty. 
__label__KIRK Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock, do you read me?
__label__KIRK A ghost planet? 
__label__KIRK But I know who you are, and no one else aboard does. While we were in Orion's past, the time revision that took place here didn't affect me. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Has the Enterprise been released yet? 
__label__KIRK Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK He is my friend. 
__label__KIRK Are we still in contact with the probe? 
__label__KIRK All right, my recommendations are as follows. We send down general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet's surface. The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer Spock. 
__label__KIRK Stand by. Do I beam down a search party? 
__label__KIRK I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said the thing was alive. It may not be communication as we understand it, but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know something else now. 
__label__KIRK Energise.
__label__KIRK No, I'll be right down. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first.
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal speed. 
__label__KIRK If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late. 
__label__KIRK That's very strange. And that woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. The shock may have damaged it. 
__label__KIRK I didn't order any (Spock enters with rifle) Affirmative. Landing party out. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Why are you doing this? 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK It might be. Come with me.
__label__KIRK I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft. 
__label__KIRK Maybe some other time, Lara. We still have our work cut out for us here. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm sure you will. I must say, I've never seen a top sergeant who looked like you. 
__label__KIRK You're confusing the stars with heaven. 
__label__KIRK No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx. 
__label__KIRK It's Klingon. Bones? 
__label__KIRK All scanners, extreme sweep. 
__label__KIRK So, I've been relieved. 
__label__KIRK Yeah. 
__label__KIRK They'll be along. You rushed us down ten minutes early. (enter building)
__label__KIRK Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old? 
__label__KIRK Status, are you still holding? 
__label__KIRK Since the days of the first wooden vessels, all shipmasters have had one happy privilege. That of uniting two people in the bonds of matrimony. We are gathered here today with you, Angela Martine, and you, Robert Tomlinson, in the sight of your fellows, in accordance with our laws and our many beliefs so that you may pledge your  SULU [OC]: Alert! Alert! All decks alert! Alert! Alert! Captain to the Bridge. All decks alert. 
__label__KIRK I tell you I must! I had two friends with me, who are lost in another time period. I must find them. You'll come back with us. 
__label__KIRK Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. You, bartender. Ed. You, er, you claim you know us. 
__label__KIRK Mara. Before you start killing, give me one minute. 
__label__KIRK You are the evil. The evil must be destroyed. Fulfill the Prime Directive. 
__label__KIRK Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father. 
__label__KIRK It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape.
__label__KIRK Jones, how did you get away from Space Station K7? You were supposed to clean up all the tribbles there. 
__label__KIRK My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What happened, what happened was an accident. 
__label__KIRK Some pre-trial investigation, Mister Spock. On Dramia Two. 
__label__KIRK Analysis, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right. We seem to have had a cave-in. 
__label__KIRK (to Scott) See what you can pick up on your communicator. 
__label__KIRK We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood cells. What better bait could we have? 
__label__KIRK Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of that system. That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut eleven years ago. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK You must take us. 
__label__KIRK How much time do we have? 
__label__KIRK Not guilty. 
__label__KIRK We have no time for chess problems. Beam me aboard! 
__label__KIRK Look, Bones, I need your help. Can you run tests, blood samples, anything at all to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them? 
__label__KIRK No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order. 
__label__KIRK Security. 
__label__KIRK My people are not responsible for your agreements. 
__label__KIRK Yes. While we're playing our game, free my ship. Let it continue on its way. In return, I'll give you a contest you'll remember. 
__label__KIRK Well, I  SPOCK: The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory banks. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy and I are going to the Bridge. Meet us there.
__label__KIRK Possibly. 
__label__KIRK And in the storage compartments. (goes to a table monitor) This is Kirk. Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris. Have them meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. Come on, Spock.
__label__KIRK Ambassador, you must dissolve the link. 
__label__KIRK Spock, what is this? 
__label__KIRK What happens to Spock if I decline? 
__label__KIRK Spock, check out the shuttlecraft. Engine, communications, everything. 
__label__KIRK Wait! Unlock us. Set us free! 
__label__KIRK An android? 
__label__KIRK You have a thick skin. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Yeoman. Bring it to the Bridge. I'll be there in a moment. 
__label__KIRK Yes. The terror of murder. The suspense. The fun. 
__label__KIRK Love? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines. We're going to put a hundred million miles between us and that madman. 
__label__KIRK Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing? 
__label__KIRK You wouldn't mind telling us? 
__label__KIRK Not soon enough. 
__label__KIRK Our position.
__label__KIRK Is there a replacement for that? 
__label__KIRK Our phasers and communicators have been switched for phonies and Commander Bem has run off. We've been separated from the rest of the landing party. Mister Spock, something funny is going on. 
__label__KIRK Excuse me. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that they will be believed. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, speed of those bolts. 
__label__KIRK What was what? 
__label__KIRK What about the armoury? 
__label__KIRK This is what you have planned for us? 
__label__KIRK Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there. 
__label__KIRK It isn't really, you know. 
__label__KIRK For sale by  TRACEY: (to Wu) Out. (Wu leaves) By those who own the serum. McCoy will eventually isolate it. Meanwhile, you inform your ship your situation's impossible. Order them away. When we're ready, we'll bargain for a whole fleet of ships to pick us up. And they'll do it. 
__label__KIRK I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we have that'll work. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers. 
__label__KIRK You could be wrong. Don't throw away your life on a mistake. 
__label__KIRK We've got to get rid of it while it's trying to think. 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. 
__label__KIRK No! 
__label__KIRK But not his wisdom. He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul. You are a machine. 
__label__KIRK Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation. 
__label__KIRK Of course. 
__label__KIRK It's Jim. 
__label__KIRK Lucien has said only that you came as wise men, helpful wizards. 
__label__KIRK And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you. 
__label__KIRK I'll meet you in the lab. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. 
__label__KIRK How long will it take you to find the trouble? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have  THEELA: You cannot leave, Mister Spock. You are needed here. Soon, all the men on your ship will feel as you do. They are all needed, and they will join us. 
__label__KIRK They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it. 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem seems to be a model prisoner. 
__label__KIRK You're on to something, Spock. What is it? 
__label__KIRK Cease fire. 
__label__KIRK Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well. 
__label__KIRK We aren't limited. We can go wherever we want in that ocean. 
__label__KIRK Forward readings, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Dehner? 
__label__KIRK Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent? 
__label__KIRK The play is over. It's been over for twenty years. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan? 
__label__KIRK I've got something else in mind. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?
__label__KIRK Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me.
__label__KIRK Scotty!
__label__KIRK Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee. 
__label__KIRK Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room. 
__label__KIRK This is the thing we come from. Lieutenant, this is what I want. 
__label__KIRK It is useless to resist us. 
__label__KIRK Reduce speed. Approach slowly. 
__label__KIRK Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Force field? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to engineering. 
__label__KIRK That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before. 
__label__KIRK He beamed up to the ship with us. 
__label__KIRK Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour watch. No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission! 
__label__KIRK Up there. One of those points of light that you see at night. 
__label__KIRK Seven hours and eight. Spock. Keys. (on a table) I'll have you out in a minute. 
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK Doc. Sorry.
__label__KIRK No, I don't think so. It'll spoil your dinner. 
__label__KIRK Opinion noted. Set a course for the Taurean system, Lieutenant Arex. Warp factor seven. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, you be careful. Mister Spock, except for our hand guns, we haven't changed, not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons. 
__label__KIRK A Klingon warship. (after a few moments) Any change, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Are you sick? 
__label__KIRK Spock, take care of McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Ship damage? 
__label__KIRK My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew. What happened to your vessel you've explained. What happened to your oath is obvious. 
__label__KIRK It gives me emotional security. Navigator, set a course ahead.
__label__KIRK You too! Get out of the clothes. Nobody's going to put the bag on me any more.
__label__KIRK Gill. Gill, why did you abandon your mission? Why did you interfere with this culture? 
__label__KIRK Someone's interfering with my command and my ship. I don't know who it is, but I mean to find out. Even you. If I thought you had the technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't. Spock does.
__label__KIRK Why, thank you. 
__label__KIRK Reading, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Spock, you may have been right. We've lost contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire solar system. Any update from Starfleet? 
__label__KIRK And I'll love you, Miramanee. Always. 
__label__KIRK But unfortunately, I can't. 
__label__KIRK Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about  SPOCK: Yes. We must all control our thoughts. 
__label__KIRK What every ship Captain knows. General Order 7, no vessel under any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four. 
__label__KIRK Ridiculous. No captain of the Starfleet would do that unless it was a matter of life and death. 
__label__KIRK Kukulkan must have visited several ancient peoples on Earth. But each one used only parts of his knowledge to build their cultures. 
__label__KIRK But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid  GABLER: Mister Scott! More trouble with the circuit work. 
__label__KIRK What's? 
__label__KIRK Record tape. Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Mister Sulu. Our forward tractor beams, adjust to repel. 
__label__KIRK Bridge here. Report. 
__label__KIRK Bridge. Spock. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Very good, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Now, you're going to help me look for my friends. 
__label__KIRK You do remember! 
__label__KIRK Either of you hurt? 
__label__KIRK Or you will kill more of my people? 
__label__KIRK Don't threaten me, Lazarus. 
__label__KIRK I want a right angled course. Shear away from him no matter which way he turns.
__label__KIRK Aurelan, it's important that you tell us. What kind of things? 
__label__KIRK Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus? 
__label__KIRK We want the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I most certainly do. Energise. 
__label__KIRK Academic. 
__label__KIRK We'd better pick up our pace. There's no place for cover if we meet any other creatures. The bearing on the signal we heard is that way. 
__label__KIRK Christine, is that you? 
__label__KIRK Phasers on heavy stun. Energise.
__label__KIRK But the energy. Regular. It's there. It's real. 
__label__KIRK We're all vulnerable in one way or another. 
__label__KIRK They may believe we do have their spy. Scan the other vessel for damage, if you will, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Very well. Spock, what have you learned about the wave bombarding us? 
__label__KIRK I guess not. 
__label__KIRK Now let's not jump to conclusions, Bones. Yes, we all got wet, so what's the joke? 
__label__KIRK are the evil. Fulfill the Prime Directive. 
__label__KIRK Repair that unit. 
__label__KIRK I think I have an idea. So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here. 
__label__KIRK Against whom? 
__label__KIRK If you had listened to me  CLAYMARE: We must be sure you are not harmed. 
__label__KIRK First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment? 
__label__KIRK Chekov, mortar and pestle. 
__label__KIRK That must be five square kilometres. 
__label__KIRK It worked. 
__label__KIRK Spock would have some logical reason for going there.
__label__KIRK That's our ship calling, Spock. You answer them. 
__label__KIRK May I have the pleasure? 
__label__KIRK Yes. If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference. 
__label__KIRK Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly. 
__label__KIRK Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony. 
__label__KIRK I'm beginning to wonder, Bones, I am beginning to wonder. 
__label__KIRK You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home? 
__label__KIRK Re-scan your sensor readings, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK All right. 
__label__KIRK Let's go. Energise.
__label__KIRK And get us out of here the same way we were brought in. 
__label__KIRK How fast? 
__label__KIRK Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK (looking at McCoy) I doubt if he'll get very far. He feels ill. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four. Tell them we're bringing the children there. Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature, and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival. 
__label__KIRK Are you aware it can change its molecular structure? 
__label__KIRK I don't know. I'm not familiar with that quadrant. Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident. Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose. 
__label__KIRK Someone or something has succeeded. Our distress signal relays have been activated. We've been given a direction to follow, but how?
__label__KIRK Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, ma'am. 
__label__KIRK Try and find it. The rest of you, look around, learn everything you can. I'll see what else I can find out from Mister Mudd. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Computer, you will not address me in that manner. Compute. 
__label__KIRK They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to. I'm in command. I could order this. But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this. But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great. Risk. Risk is our business. That's what the starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her. You may dissent without prejudice.
__label__KIRK He is found, and we will leave. 
__label__KIRK Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been among us. 
__label__KIRK Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Palmer, notify Starbase we have the six aboard who stole the space cruiser Aurora. Regrettably, the space cruiser itself was destroyed. 
__label__KIRK Weapons status. 
__label__KIRK Miss McHuron, I don't  EVE: Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says.
__label__KIRK We're not interested in legend. He's a living being, and intelligent life form. That's all we have to know about him. We will not join in harming him. 
__label__KIRK I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru. 
__label__KIRK Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert.
__label__KIRK Emergency beam up. Enterprise, come in. No response. Spock, can't you take your hands off her? 
__label__KIRK And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Excuse us, miss. We didn't mean to trespass. It's cold outside. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes, at the academy. He was dropped in his fifth year. He went into the merchant service. 
__label__KIRK How much time, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will be a target. If they should emerge  SULU: We'll handle them, sir. 
__label__KIRK There she is. That's the one. What have you done with Spock's brain? 
__label__KIRK So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this  SURAK: The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After all, I'm no warrior. 
__label__KIRK Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation. 
__label__KIRK I have to, or you'll become as bad as the Earthmen you fear.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present course. 
__label__KIRK You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law. 
__label__KIRK Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it. Comet is highly dangerous.
__label__KIRK Joy to you, friend. Peace and contentment will fill you. You will know the peace of Landru. 
__label__KIRK Then good day, and thank you for the presents. 
__label__KIRK I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings. 
__label__KIRK That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius. 
__label__KIRK Shut up. We're rescuing you. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Request denied.
__label__KIRK Walking Bear, full power, all shields. Reverse engines and get us away from that beam. 
__label__KIRK Spock, ask Scotty how long it would take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks. 
__label__KIRK Why? Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics? 
__label__KIRK Oh, you've heard about that, have you? 
__label__KIRK An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual. 
__label__KIRK We can prove it, if he's insane. 
__label__KIRK Will it take us to McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know. 
__label__KIRK We will not co-operate. 
__label__KIRK Or attack. 
__label__KIRK He's already told me what I wanted to know. 
__label__KIRK We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress. We had hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees. It is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case. And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions. I'll try not to upset you. You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. When they wake up, take them to Security holding. 
__label__KIRK I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk. 
__label__KIRK Lock on, Mister Sulu. Maximum speed. 
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK There will be no error. As for the rest of it, the readings will show. You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections. 
__label__KIRK How long has it been? 
__label__KIRK That's correct. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. Mrs. April, you're about to see another of the galaxy's most beautiful sights, the Beta Niobe's supernova. 
__label__KIRK We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us. 
__label__KIRK Bob Wesley. He left Starfleet for the governorship. He's no hysteric. 
__label__KIRK Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible. Bring all available biographical material with you. Kirk out. Mister Spock, come with me. 
__label__KIRK I told you to stay in Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock.
__label__KIRK Have you located the malfunction? 
__label__KIRK I'll find it. 
__label__KIRK Tell Karla Five that Mister Spock, Commodore April and myself will be beaming down. 
__label__KIRK Mister Arex, take over for him. Lieutenant Uhura, report to navigation console. 
__label__KIRK I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons? 
__label__KIRK Standard orbit, Mister Painter. 
__label__KIRK Not this one. Tell me. 
__label__KIRK Ready, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get. Detonator. 
__label__KIRK That's not good enough.
__label__KIRK Mister Johnson, can you hear me? 
__label__KIRK His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid. 
__label__KIRK The new weapon. Spock? 
__label__KIRK Very well, Mister Arex. Spock, let's see how close your percentage is. 
__label__KIRK Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case. 
__label__KIRK Hurry up with that shot! 
__label__KIRK There's still one chance. After that ship enters the nova, it should burn up and break contact with our tractor beam. Mister Spock, how long will we have to apply full braking power and execute course change? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Ah. Mister Spock, check them out. 
__label__KIRK What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him? 
__label__KIRK Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman. 
__label__KIRK Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second (as another tribble hits him on the head) close that door.
__label__KIRK Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and channels it through his body? 
__label__KIRK Landru! Landru. We are the Archons. We are the Archons. We've come to speak. We are the Archons. We want to talk to you. 
__label__KIRK Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your foolishness.
__label__KIRK Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen? 
__label__KIRK Then why do you want to kill me? 
__label__KIRK Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel. 
__label__KIRK You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all.
__label__KIRK Phaser banks? 
__label__KIRK How long have you been aboard the Enterprise? 
__label__KIRK Fire into it immediately! 
__label__KIRK Why a cat? 
__label__KIRK Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer. Now it's wounded, probably in pain somewhere back there.
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation. 
__label__KIRK Do we have emergency warp? 
__label__KIRK Your desire to see Kollos is madness! You can never see him.
__label__KIRK Daras. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, anything from the planet? 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK All right. We must take care not to be seen. Hey, Bem. Bem, come back! Scotty, Sulu, stay here with the monitoring devices. Come on, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Take a medical reading, Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura, call Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Garrovick, get back to the ship. Tell them to prepare to detonate. 
__label__KIRK Where? 
__label__KIRK Nothing would please me more, Your Glory. But your impetuous nature  ELAAN: Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission, so I stabbed him. Just to be Troyian is enough. 
__label__KIRK What kind of a mind could think of such a thing? 
__label__KIRK Composition of walls? 
__label__KIRK Nomad. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that zone. Direct computer feed to Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Henoch, your condition? 
__label__KIRK Great anger. 
__label__KIRK Everything's all right, Mister Spock, for us. 
__label__KIRK All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I double-dare you. Look at the blood on my face. Now look at your hands.
__label__KIRK Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three, report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet. Ordinance condition One A. 
__label__KIRK All right. What do you want? 
__label__KIRK Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming? 
__label__KIRK That doesn't mean he was responsible for it. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, reverse engines. Slow us down. 
__label__KIRK Kodos is dead. 
__label__KIRK Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my crewwomen alone too. (to Ross) You're not to dance with him. I don't like it. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder, please. Use these co-ordinates. 
__label__KIRK It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours. I know, it almost killed me. 
__label__KIRK Yes, read it. 
__label__KIRK And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing. 
__label__KIRK The Body is one. 
__label__KIRK Get her to Sickbay at once. 
__label__KIRK No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by.
__label__KIRK Providing for all their needs means using thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy [Bridge]
__label__KIRK Put it down. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I deny it. I was reading in the library when I heard her scream. My lord, the library? Do you remember where the library is, my lord? 
__label__KIRK Tired. Very tired. You did a fine job, Bones. I think I'll sleep.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Engineering. 
__label__KIRK All right, children, you've had a busy day. I think you could use some rest. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters. 
__label__KIRK Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes! 
__label__KIRK If you have the courage. 
__label__KIRK You don't know. You're not a doctor. 
__label__KIRK Metal. Forged, tempered. Our apish friends didn't make these.
__label__KIRK Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both. Now where is it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, what is it? 
__label__KIRK Turn it down a little. Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship. Doctor McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed. 
__label__KIRK There's a body down there. Sturgeon. 
__label__KIRK Is he the thing that attacked you? 
__label__KIRK Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? 
__label__KIRK Situation, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Oh, er, thank you. That's, er, very magnanimous of you. 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Scott seems to agree with you. The two of you meet me in the transporter room on the double. 
__label__KIRK Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces.
__label__KIRK Hold our course, Mister Hanson. 
__label__KIRK No, of course. That's, that's me. That's me. But what's causing your tricorder to react? 
__label__KIRK Sargon here, McCoy. I'm in your deck six briefing room. 
__label__KIRK No, we're not. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Sure, Bones, what? 
__label__KIRK At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, your estimate. 
__label__KIRK An intelligence that can produce this kind of mutation can change us back. We've got to find it, Bones. It must be there. 
__label__KIRK Reverse and energise. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant M'Ress, all shore leaves are cancelled until further notice. Mister Arex, you have the conn. Investigating landing party will consist of Spock, Sulu, McCoy and myself. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries.
__label__KIRK Yes.
__label__KIRK Report, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Never mind. Spock, can you fill in for Sulu and Uhura? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Captain Kirk here. Red priority. Red priority. 
__label__KIRK I see no danger here. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean, you can't do that. Follow standard procedure.
__label__KIRK The error was corrected. 
__label__KIRK But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer. 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course you were.
__label__KIRK (holding out his hand for the offending weapon) Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK Well I want to know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes? 
__label__KIRK You did, long ago, when it was needed most. Our people were children then. Kukulkan, we've grown up now. We don't need you anymore.
__label__KIRK On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four and six. Widest possible scatter. 
__label__KIRK He froze. One man was killed. Another may die. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure about that? 
__label__KIRK And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes. 
__label__KIRK Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.
__label__KIRK Then your guess was right. 
__label__KIRK Computer, destruct sequence. Are you ready to copy? 
__label__KIRK I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question. 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk. 
__label__KIRK That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you! 
__label__KIRK Scotty, where've you been? Where are you? 
__label__KIRK Yes. What about Alexander? 
__label__KIRK Answer me. 
__label__KIRK Phaser power packs. 
__label__KIRK We will not negotiate. Do you concur? 
__label__KIRK In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The gangs nearly took over. 
__label__KIRK Engage.
__label__KIRK You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby? 
__label__KIRK Let's have it. The truth this time. 
__label__KIRK Colonel, would you mind being careful with that? 
__label__KIRK Oh? I thought it was my idea. 
__label__KIRK I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan.
__label__KIRK A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command officers. Since there are only two of that rank available SPOCK: Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command rank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher Pike.
__label__KIRK We must try, Xerius. Elysia is, in many respects, a perfect society. But with all its virtues, it is not home. And home, with all its faults, is where we prefer to be. 
__label__KIRK I wasn't that bad, was I? 
__label__KIRK Keep trying, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Spock, you old  G SPOCK: And you needn't worry, Captain Kirk, about a master race.
__label__KIRK You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Think positively, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Yeoman.
__label__KIRK Sulu, what is it? Where's Lieutenant O'Neil? 
__label__KIRK They will be very effective. sir. They've been severely tested, and the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties. 
__label__KIRK And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object? 
__label__KIRK Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit.
__label__KIRK Garth, you have only a handful of men. 
__label__KIRK And new course? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Marple! 
__label__KIRK Be sensible, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Not you, Bones. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. You're best qualified to go. 
__label__KIRK Did I hear that right? 
__label__KIRK And you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock? 
__label__KIRK There is indeed, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk. 
__label__KIRK Good. Then you wouldn't mind if we looked around? 
__label__KIRK You will. Both of us. 
__label__KIRK Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott. Do you have any other helpful opinions? 
__label__KIRK No, just a little shaken up. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, since they are learning from us, why don't we learn something from them? 
__label__KIRK Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent.
__label__KIRK If I were you, I'd think about saving my life. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others. If Captain Merik is Merikus, then he has violated that law, and he must be taken away and punished. Will you help us get to the truth of all this? 
__label__KIRK Miss McHuron, if you don't mind  SCOTT: Our last crystal, sir. It's gone. 
__label__KIRK Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK Have repair crews been assigned? 
__label__KIRK Flash the Bridge. Put all decks on the alert.
__label__KIRK Tricorder readings, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Ninety? 
__label__KIRK I can't hold out against that many. 
__label__KIRK We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed. Or that they're not prepared for a general war. Open a hailing frequency. 
__label__KIRK I'm already on board, Spock. Do you have the information? 
__label__KIRK Which humans, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Who have you come for this time? 
__label__KIRK That was due to be next. Life-support malfunction. 
__label__KIRK If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it. 
__label__KIRK I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect.
__label__KIRK Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her? 
__label__KIRK Yes, but terraforming usually follows a pattern. This seems like random choice. 
__label__KIRK But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this Enterprise, Mister Spock. Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans and make it stick. Push till it gives. You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet. 
__label__KIRK It was that bad? 
__label__KIRK Keep talking! 
__label__KIRK Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK I don't understand. They said they'd saved us once. 
__label__KIRK I don't intend to kill him. 
__label__KIRK Run. We've got to find some light. We can't do anything unless we can see what we're fighting. Don't stop. Try to stay together. 
__label__KIRK He's not dying? 
__label__KIRK It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond. 
__label__KIRK How?
__label__KIRK I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee.
__label__KIRK The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour. 
__label__KIRK Can you confirm that, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first. 
__label__KIRK Explain that. 
__label__KIRK (on back, pumping pedals) Just a few seconds more.
__label__KIRK Security, cancel that order. Implement a full search for the mechanism. All decks report to me here. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, I need your approval, too. Since you'll work with them, furnishing them all they need to make the android robots. 
__label__KIRK That's a fair statement, Bones. Now that the creature is dead, let's save some lives. We'll deliver your medicine. Bridge, this is Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Disengage computer control, Uhura.
__label__KIRK There were six of you on the mission. 
__label__KIRK Yes, here. Not our universe, not our ship. Something parallel. A parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane.
__label__KIRK Intelligence different from ours or superior?
__label__KIRK Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK It has directional equipment that keys on indurite. 
__label__KIRK You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter? 
__label__KIRK Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields. 
__label__KIRK It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore. 
__label__KIRK Is that all you have to offer? 
__label__KIRK You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer. 
__label__KIRK Trying to. Something's obstructing it. (finally the familiar shape fully materialises) Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to leave the ship. 
__label__KIRK Who threw the first punch, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Tricky stuff. Are you sure you want to risk  (The hypo is administered and Sulu opens his eyes.) 
__label__KIRK It might be just an atmospheric effect. Some kind of electrical storm. We've seen unidentified planetary phenomena before that have resembled intelligent activity. 
__label__KIRK Plot an extended orbit to clear disturbance. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Get that ship out of here. Stay at minimum distance for absolute safety. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, use your scanners to assemble a diagram of the cloud's composition and feed it to the library computer. 
__label__KIRK I am? 
__label__KIRK Something like that. Remember, he's keeping a force field on the ship and he's expending energy down here. You said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared. If we can wear him out, overwork him, that might do it. 
__label__KIRK I have orders to the contrary. This is not a passenger ship. 
__label__KIRK You may begin, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Did you feel a presence, an intelligence? 
__label__KIRK Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us. 
__label__KIRK Finnegan. One thing FINNEGAN: Sure. Name it.
__label__KIRK That computer must be programming these replicas. 
__label__KIRK She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things. 
__label__KIRK Then you can tell us. Do you remember? 
__label__KIRK What are you waiting for? Hurry! 
__label__KIRK One specimen, you said. One specimen! What happened to my men? 
__label__KIRK Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports? 
__label__KIRK I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her! 
__label__KIRK What about the rest of you? 
__label__KIRK I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves. 
__label__KIRK If I sent you to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by. 
__label__KIRK I don't believe you. 
__label__KIRK Elevator, and going down quite a ways.
__label__KIRK Can you do it, Lee? 
__label__KIRK But you've got, er, eleven. 
__label__KIRK Spock, did Selek look like you do now? 
__label__KIRK Yes! Yes! Atoz! 
__label__KIRK When may we resume discussion? 
__label__KIRK Could the strain really have killed her? 
__label__KIRK It's not necessary, Mister Spock. I know exactly where the creature is. 
__label__KIRK Is there any way we can help you, Sargon? 
__label__KIRK Yes, but you can do better than that. There's still not enough sport in just killing me with a sword. 
__label__KIRK Was I too crude? 
__label__KIRK Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure. I'm sure you know that, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK How do you mean? 
__label__KIRK (knife at her throat) You said you're prepared to die. Does that mean you'd prefer to die? I think we can get you safely to the ship.
__label__KIRK We don't have much time, Spock. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK We'll stay. 
__label__KIRK I am Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my medical officer, Doctor McCoy. My first officer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Agreed, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Too quickly. Bridge. 
__label__KIRK That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact.
__label__KIRK We could rest awhile. Lara? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Who, then? 
__label__KIRK No. You're the doctor. They don't want to force you. They need your goodwill. They're trying  PARMEN: Captain, go while you still can. 
__label__KIRK Carter Winston. 
__label__KIRK Any chance of a projection or a ledge? 
__label__KIRK That's not good enough, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK We're also very strong. 
__label__KIRK Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already.
__label__KIRK My friend is obviously Chinese. I see you've noticed the ears.
__label__KIRK Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu. Adjust. 
__label__KIRK But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us. 
__label__KIRK Like the beating of a heart. 
__label__KIRK Storage compartments? Storage compartments? 
__label__KIRK Got any miracles in your computer, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Invisible. Malfunction? 
__label__KIRK Your medication worked quickly. 
__label__KIRK Mallory. 
__label__KIRK Don't you know me? 
__label__KIRK Spock! 
__label__KIRK What happens if we get him out of there? 
__label__KIRK Kukulkan, can't you control one of your own creatures? 
__label__KIRK How long to repair warp drive? 
__label__KIRK That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato.
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here! Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the Bridge. Lieutenant, all decks, damage report. 
__label__KIRK You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong. 
__label__KIRK It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble. 
__label__KIRK The phaser bore can cut through twenty metres of rock per minute.
__label__KIRK And yet it has. 
__label__KIRK In your own private paradise. 
__label__KIRK Start a trace-back of all circuits. 
__label__KIRK That's, er. We'll figure it out later. 
__label__KIRK In every revolution, there's one man with a vision. 
__label__KIRK Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus. I'd like to show them to you. Would you like to see them? Mister Spock, the pictures. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world. 
__label__KIRK I said. 
__label__KIRK Freeze it. 
__label__KIRK Explain, Lieutenant Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Commissioner, all of them. 
__label__KIRK It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way. 
__label__KIRK Was there any notation on the death of Ambassador Sarek's son? 
__label__KIRK Right here. You all right? 
__label__KIRK Slow to warp three. 
__label__KIRK The thralls will be trained? 
__label__KIRK Each testifier will sit here, place his hand on this plate. Any deviation from factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer which will in turn notify us.
__label__KIRK Hard starboard, two one seven mark five. 
__label__KIRK Where is everyone? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we're suddenly off course. Check our manoeuvering controls. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. Fire. (nothing happens) Hand-to-hand. 
__label__KIRK Set course for Colony Beta Six. 
__label__KIRK Grab him! Poison. I'm sure your ship is ready to self-destruct, Captain, but if it does, your crew will die for nothing. We're not going to let you commit suicide. Whether they die or not, you'll still stand trial, and Orion's little game of neutrality and piracy is over. 
__label__KIRK You? Yes, I can see that. Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship. 
__label__KIRK You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry. 
__label__KIRK Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on.
__label__KIRK Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake.
__label__KIRK No, but thank you anyway. 
__label__KIRK He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy. 
__label__KIRK Scotty? 
__label__KIRK You think that happened? 
__label__KIRK May I ask what crime you committed?
__label__KIRK Change course. Pursue and overtake. 
__label__KIRK And that irritates you, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK It's your human half I'm worried about. 
__label__KIRK Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world. 
__label__KIRK We took no action against your ship, Kang. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Then the evil must be destroyed. That is the Prime Directive. And you are the evil. 
__label__KIRK Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first planet survey. 
__label__KIRK Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight? 
__label__KIRK Just leave us alone, Mister Earp. That's all we ask. 
__label__KIRK You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument? 
__label__KIRK Where does the trail lead to? 
__label__KIRK No, of course you didn't. 
__label__KIRK Make it less. 
__label__KIRK What did you offer the others if they won? 
__label__KIRK That seems logical. 
__label__KIRK How's that? 
__label__KIRK So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The creature. 
__label__KIRK Well, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, there's nothing there. 
__label__KIRK Good work. 
__label__KIRK Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient. 
__label__KIRK Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible.
__label__KIRK More symbols. Can you read them? 
__label__KIRK I did not recognise those words, you said them so badly, Without meaning. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, did you get that pilot? 
__label__KIRK Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Just don't put me inside a bulkhead. Energise.
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun! 
__label__KIRK You said you discovered a new food concentrate. What am I supposed to put in my log, that you lied? That you diverted a starship with false information? You're not only in trouble, you've put me in trouble, too. 
__label__KIRK I spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Captain Garth  GARTH: Lord Garth! 
__label__KIRK Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests? 
__label__KIRK And it can bear up under full phaser power. 
__label__KIRK Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way. How about that T'Pau? They couldn't turn her down. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Altair Six. Leave orbit when ready. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK I, argh, I don't know.
__label__KIRK Get him out of here.
__label__KIRK All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile, let me apologise for bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly, but it couldn't be helped.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Let me guess. You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them. And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet. Then we'll sit down and talk, right? 
__label__KIRK Energise.
__label__KIRK Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't it in its specified location? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions. 
__label__KIRK However? 
__label__KIRK Stand back. 
__label__KIRK Sulu, flank speed ahead. Our only chance is to try to get into orbit around that thing. 
__label__KIRK When? 
__label__KIRK Another Armenia, Belgium. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Professor Crater! Professor! Professor! 
__label__KIRK That's one thing we can be sure of. Death is real. 
__label__KIRK You all right? 
__label__KIRK More power.
__label__KIRK Are you sure? 
__label__KIRK Maintain orbit. Open the channel to Starfleet Command.
__label__KIRK Professor Crater, I'm Captain Kirk. This is  CRATER: The heroic Captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar space to preserve our health. Your sense of duty is overwhelming. Now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone. We need salt against the heat. Aside from that, we're doing very well, thank you. 
__label__KIRK We've got to save him. 
__label__KIRK Not in free fall. 
__label__KIRK I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst. 
__label__KIRK What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider. 
__label__KIRK Professor and Nancy Crater. 
__label__KIRK There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions. 
__label__KIRK Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous creature. 
__label__KIRK Wouldn't know this was a spaceship. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK What era? 
__label__KIRK Fan out. Follow me. Security. 
__label__KIRK What was going on that would have upset him? 
__label__KIRK Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us. 
__label__KIRK Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning. 
__label__KIRK (to therapist) How does it work? 
__label__KIRK Easy, Bones. As long as you know there's something down there, you know as much as we do. The rest is only guesses. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome.
__label__KIRK Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters until further notice. 
__label__KIRK We'll tell you what we decide to tell you in a few moments. In the meantime, relax. You're our guest. I have a feeling you'll find it interesting. 
__label__KIRK A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to poison one of my crewmen. 
__label__KIRK Can you verify that, Navigator? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You're killing your own daughter. How can you do that? 
__label__KIRK Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk. 
__label__KIRK It's regrettable that he died for nothing. 
__label__KIRK I'm worried about the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship. 
__label__KIRK Hold it! Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Good. Nurse, how is he? 
__label__KIRK Gill. Gill. Gill, can you hear me? You've got to tell those people what happened! You're the only one who can prevent the slaughter! Gill! 
__label__KIRK What was the exact date of your lift off? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s, but  KHAN: I find myself growing fatigued, Doctor. May we continue this questioning at some other time? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Doctor, how's the girl? 
__label__KIRK Yes. You're quite right. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Go on. I'm waiting to hear the rest. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we can both be sure of.
__label__KIRK Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating? 
__label__KIRK What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the Body? 
__label__KIRK Request opening in your force field for beaming down of cargo.
__label__KIRK Are you troubled now? 
__label__KIRK I'll denounce you to the inquisitor. You came here from the future just as I did. Therefore, you, too, are a witch. 
__label__KIRK It's my ship they want, and very badly. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, explain. 
__label__KIRK Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?  GARROVICK: Dikironium reading now, sir. Bearing ninety four mark seven, angle of elevation six degrees. Holding steady. 
__label__KIRK What about recent history? 
__label__KIRK I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry. 
__label__KIRK Denevan ship, this is the USS Enterprise. Can you reverse your course? Acknowledge. 
__label__KIRK Security, take him to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Bones, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Deep space. Full power. Widest angle of dispersion. Maintain. 
__label__KIRK How bad? 
__label__KIRK Lock him up.
__label__KIRK Deflectors up. Yellow Alert. Cut speed to warp one. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise to Korby. We have your co-ordinates pin-pointed. We're preparing to beam down a party. It may interest you that we have aboard this vessel  KORBY [OC]: I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam down alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries of such a nature they may require an extraordinary decision from you. 
__label__KIRK In that case, gentlemen  CHEKOV [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Come in.  KIRK: Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him. 
__label__KIRK There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement?
__label__KIRK Marta. Marta, I can help you, but I must get to the Enterprise to do that. 
__label__KIRK Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission. 
__label__KIRK There will be soon. Doctor Sevrin. You are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy. 
__label__KIRK It'll take four days to get the drug, but Spock will die in three. There's got to be a way. 
__label__KIRK Then show yourselves. 
__label__KIRK What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia? 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK I thought I said that.  
__label__KIRK What do you want from her?
__label__KIRK No chance of restoring warp drive? 
__label__KIRK Getting a reading? 
__label__KIRK Bridge. His logical selection was compassion.
__label__KIRK Rila, this is my engineering officer, Mister Scott. Tribune Rila is an Aquan. Their city is a short distance away. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?
__label__KIRK Did you get this at the space station? 
__label__KIRK The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?
__label__KIRK So, we're all just fine, but whatever was on that ship used our transporter beam to come aboard with us, and now it's here. 
__label__KIRK What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians? 
__label__KIRK And the great misery which you now face. 
__label__KIRK Put all secondary systems on standby. Shield power has unconditional priority. 
__label__KIRK You. 
__label__KIRK And why not? You've been using me and my crew. 
__label__KIRK How does it work? Show us. 
__label__KIRK You've been told everything. There's nothing else to say. 
__label__KIRK No. It's not all bad, Mister Spock. Who knows. You may be able to beat your next captain at chess. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Against what? There's no life on this planet. 
__label__KIRK Vanna, I've brought you a gift. There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time. This mask will prevent any further damage. 
__label__KIRK Spock, Sarek how are they? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? 
__label__KIRK Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia? 
__label__KIRK I'll try. 
__label__KIRK Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm going to use it. My dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave, but only twelve at a time. And I assure you, for every man you bring down here, I shall have one security guard. There will be no trouble. 
__label__KIRK Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel. 
__label__KIRK Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them? 
__label__KIRK All right, let's try that one again. Go! 
__label__KIRK Of course. 
__label__KIRK Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log. We were in an ion storm. Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved. I was in command. The decisions were mine, no one else's. Charges of malice have been raised. There was no malice.
__label__KIRK So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move? 
__label__KIRK We've received a message from the Federation that might bring you some cheer. Lieutenant Uhura, would you relay it to Commodore April and his wife? 
__label__KIRK Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is. 
__label__KIRK You don't call that damage? 
__label__KIRK Very good, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK No, beloved. If we torment ourselves  MULHALL: Beloved. What will that word mean to a machine? 
__label__KIRK You play chess, Charlie? 
__label__KIRK Spock, take over. 
__label__KIRK Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation. Very neat. 
__label__KIRK You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Anan Seven. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!
__label__KIRK Oh, my.
__label__KIRK No. I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little. 
__label__KIRK Come on. 
__label__KIRK Exactly what I think. Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a beloved animal, would you say? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Lieutenant, what is it? 
__label__KIRK Will you provide all my nourishment? 
__label__KIRK Any contact, Lieutenant Uhura? 
__label__KIRK Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet. 
__label__KIRK All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll take the lithium crystals. 
__label__KIRK Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Switch to auxiliary. 
__label__KIRK Agreed. More like love. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK You only heard part of it. I just started. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Mister Sulu, report. 
__label__KIRK Spock! Much further? 
__label__KIRK Come over there. Well? 
__label__KIRK I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any objections? 
__label__KIRK I'll keep that in mind, Mister Bailey, when this becomes a democracy.
__label__KIRK We came nowhere near Romulan territory. I deny all charges and plan to file a detailed complaint with the Federation. 
__label__KIRK We'll both look, Mister Atoz.
__label__KIRK Well, I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere who'll stop that war.  
__label__KIRK Arm all phasers. Deflector shields up. 
__label__KIRK Satellite control, this is the Captain. Energise all satellites. 
__label__KIRK How are the repairs progressing, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK The alien creatures on Deneva have been destroyed  ZAHRA: Captain, look. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Then anything you develop here as a result of all this is useless. 
__label__KIRK We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's throats. 
__label__KIRK Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am. 
__label__KIRK Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of  CHRISTOPHER: A boy. I'm going to have a son. 
__label__KIRK Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know that, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Listen to me. Listen to me! 
__label__KIRK You have endangered all of us by your actions, and you have forced us to interfere with the natives of a planet that deserves prime directive protection. 
__label__KIRK You haven't won, Trelane. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty, what is it? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired. 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Spock, what have you got? 
__label__KIRK She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence. 
__label__KIRK Where is my other crewman? 
__label__KIRK Strong enough to eat machinery? 
__label__KIRK Lazarus, you're hurt. I know. I sympathise, but I've got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about. Now where are those crystals? 
__label__KIRK Bones, what? 
__label__KIRK On my way. Scotty. Bones? 
__label__KIRK I want every inch of this terrain checked. Look for footprints, movement, anything. Call out if you spot anything. Don't be afraid to use your weapons. 
__label__KIRK I'm trying to help you, Spock. 
__label__KIRK We could not leave one of our own behind. It is our responsibility to take care of our own, just as it is your responsibility to take care of yours. We could not leave him here where he might further interfere with your, your children. 
__label__KIRK Very impressive. 
__label__KIRK Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers.
__label__KIRK They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK So do I. They gave us so much. The Greek civilisation, much of our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings. In a way, they began the Golden Age. Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just to have gathered a few laurel leaves?  
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters.
__label__KIRK I don't like the way he orders her around. 
__label__KIRK We don't know. He just suddenly screamed in pain and died. 
__label__KIRK Bones, can you tell me what they all died of?
__label__KIRK This is the captain. All science, engineering, and supervisory personnel, lock into the briefing room. Our next decision can be of enormous consequence, not only to us but to Earth's entire future.
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy saved your life. 
__label__KIRK But not only to me, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Will it reach the ship? 
__label__KIRK Bones, he's the cloud. Its thoughts are here. Don't move.
__label__KIRK I must ask you to let us go back to our ship. 
__label__KIRK Bring them back, Mister Sulu. Have them ram the Klingon ship. 
__label__KIRK Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK What do your sensors read? 
__label__KIRK (holds her) We're all frightened. (Miri leaves) 
__label__KIRK There'll only be one of you in the end. One jealous god. if all this makes a god, or is it making you something else? 
__label__KIRK Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait.
__label__KIRK Lock in phaser tracking controls. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Helmsman, emergency battery power. 
__label__KIRK Agreed. How much desert do we have to cross, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK (answers comm. beep) Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Keep him alive, Bones. I want to know what's been happening here.
__label__KIRK What evidence do you have against Mister Jones? 
__label__KIRK Let's get there as fast as we can. If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there. 
__label__KIRK I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. These men are part of my crew. We're not really here, we're from the future. We haven't been born yet. Feel the material in my shirt. Now feel the material in your own shirt. Do you notice any difference? 
__label__KIRK We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here. 
__label__KIRK Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit station, and put it on scramble. 
__label__KIRK Maybe we can get them to give them back to us. 
__label__KIRK Spock, listen. Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing. He had the right idea but not enough power to do it. Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded? 
__label__KIRK Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance!
__label__KIRK Of everything that exists, everywhere. 
__label__KIRK A room should reflect its occupant. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, help.
__label__KIRK Spock. You can see. 
__label__KIRK This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, status report. 
__label__KIRK As soon as we reach Starbase Twelve. 
__label__KIRK That's not enough, Rojan. 
__label__KIRK A civilisation that advanced three hundred million years ago before life even emerged on Earth. 
__label__KIRK Source? 
__label__KIRK Your orders are shoot to kill. Protect yourself at all times.
__label__KIRK You should be the first to be on our side. Two hundred hostages killed. 
__label__KIRK No. It seems to be waiting. I tried talking to it, but it didn't do any good. 
__label__KIRK Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?
__label__KIRK (sound of running) Come on!
__label__KIRK It's been damaged. I'll bet she was pulled in like we were. 
__label__KIRK And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines? 
__label__KIRK No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, whatever we're dealing with, I don't think we can bribe it. We must be honest. Kirk to alien intelligence. I don't think it's strong enough to be noticeable. 
__label__KIRK That means those search parties will be crawling all over that wreckage. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk ready to beam up. 
__label__KIRK Suppose it camouflaged itself. Let's assume that it's intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it. 
__label__KIRK No. No! I can't leave! (he's very relieved) Emotions. Violent emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.
__label__KIRK Very good. We'll be right up. 
__label__KIRK Are they in the Sickbay? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise to Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I'm very well aware of that, Lieutenant. Try it. 
__label__KIRK We have a flop. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Full sensor scan of the region, please. 
__label__KIRK Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to. 
__label__KIRK All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today. 
__label__KIRK We intend no harm. 
__label__KIRK Sulu, take over the transporter here. Spock. 
__label__KIRK Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK I'll try and avoid it. 
__label__KIRK McCoy wants you in Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Very well. All decks, security alert. 
__label__KIRK Message. Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma Hydra Four. Said comet is now,  SPOCK: (consulting PADD) Quadrant four four eight, sir. 
__label__KIRK They've got the booth curtained off. Bring that light to the side of her face. Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth? 
__label__KIRK You left us. The room became lonely. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet! Just a moment! 
__label__KIRK What's that?
__label__KIRK Well, we can't get to it. We can't talk to it unless it wants to talk to us. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under Argelian jurisdiction. If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it. 
__label__KIRK Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient. 
__label__KIRK You know of Earth? You've been there? 
__label__KIRK Summation. 
__label__KIRK That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster! 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human.
__label__KIRK (barging in without knocking) We're overdue for our talk, aren't we? 
__label__KIRK Put it on the screen. 
__label__KIRK All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not chess, Mister Spock, poker. Do you know the game? Ship to ship.
__label__KIRK This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We (humming noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for. We need your help, and now. 
__label__KIRK You seem to think this Companion of yours can do almost anything. 
__label__KIRK What about the others? 
__label__KIRK He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't  COLEMAN: You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his murderer. 
__label__KIRK A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt. See? 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, he is not the man you loved. Carter Winston is dead. 
__label__KIRK There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I understand. You have two hundred years of catching up to do. 
__label__KIRK Neither do I, but it appears to be necessary. Energise. 
__label__KIRK DeSalle, channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units. 
__label__KIRK You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony. 
__label__KIRK Take him to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK All right. Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time.
__label__KIRK All right, Doctor, you built this thing. How do you propose to turn it off? 
__label__KIRK Maybe too much. 
__label__KIRK And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play, and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes. 
__label__KIRK Damage control, report to the first officer. 
__label__KIRK It's an order. Give me the weapon. 
__label__KIRK The very same. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Open a channel, Uhura.
__label__KIRK Primary mental evolution. Incredible. 
__label__KIRK Spock, try to get through to him with a mind probe. If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant, no matter what it does.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Test it in combat. 
__label__KIRK We'll leave when the gas has effect. 
__label__KIRK Kukulkan, I think we've earned the right to be heard. 
__label__KIRK Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Fire phasers. 
__label__KIRK Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue. 
__label__KIRK Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve? 
__label__KIRK If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a leave. I would have granted it.
__label__KIRK He is our friend. You must take us to him. We beg you. Soon it will be too late. 
__label__KIRK Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for? 
__label__KIRK They're mechanical. 
__label__KIRK Approach course, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Air sample?
__label__KIRK Let me speak to your Fuhrer. I'll tell him everything he wants to know. 
__label__KIRK A phaser. 
__label__KIRK Your explanation, sir? 
__label__KIRK Go on. Finish. Ben was a friend of yours, and  MCCOY: Jim. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, what's our orbit status? 
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us? 
__label__KIRK You don't think so, what? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I remember.
__label__KIRK If Lucien put it there  SPOCK: If Lucien put it there, Captain, the questions become, why is he hiding us, and, what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his people? 
__label__KIRK No. But the death of the crewman. 
__label__KIRK I'd love to oblige you, Mister Spock, but we're not all together. Besides, we have Apollo to deal with. 
__label__KIRK Photon torpedoes. Minimum spread pattern. 
__label__KIRK Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down to planet six. 
__label__KIRK Reverse course, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK All right, Spock, let's have it. 
__label__KIRK Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power. 
__label__KIRK Before Landru? How long ago was that? 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK How's that possible? 
__label__KIRK Any signs of life?
__label__KIRK Adam. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant O'Neil. He's one of our men. 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. 
__label__KIRK Nothing of importance. Fatigue perhaps. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the former commander of the Enterprise, Fleet Captain Pike, urgently requesting that we divert here.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request  KOMACK [on monitor]: Altair Six is no ordinary matter. That area is just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict. This inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system. Our appearance there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the Klingon Empire. 
__label__KIRK Then act in a civilised fashion. 
__label__KIRK Yes, he is. 
__label__KIRK By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an interplanetary war. 
__label__KIRK Oh, no. You were quite accurate. I plan to prove it to you. ANAN: Open a channel to the Enterprise. You give me no choice, Captain. We are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits. 
__label__KIRK Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record. 
__label__KIRK There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock. Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment. 
__label__KIRK It is necessary. Not only for them, but for us as well. 
__label__KIRK This gentleman is not  ATOZ: You, sir. I think you'll find something interesting over here. 
__label__KIRK Helm status, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations, gather data for computer banks. Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Where is she? Has something happened to her? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. I think we have an answer to the height problem. The transporter beam apparently returns our molecules to normal spacing. Kirk to Enterprise, do you read me? 
__label__KIRK I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful. 
__label__KIRK I don't know, but he does. And now he wants revenge for a non-existent loss. 
__label__KIRK Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind of understanding. 
__label__KIRK I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan. 
__label__KIRK I must say that's a gracious invitation. 
__label__KIRK Stand by. All hands, this is the captain. We are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force. We're going to apply  [Sickbay]
__label__KIRK Do they live here with you? 
__label__KIRK I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about the grain, Bones? 
__label__KIRK That refers to a living, growing culture. Do you think this one is? 
__label__KIRK Good night, Bones.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years? 
__label__KIRK I see your flower has blossomed again. 
__label__KIRK You said I was in perfect condition. 
__label__KIRK It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK I'm not sure. 
__label__KIRK Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine? 
__label__KIRK There's another chamber. 
__label__KIRK Klingon! 
__label__KIRK Close channel, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos.
__label__KIRK Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. (they lie him on a couch)
__label__KIRK You could call it that. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You'll go up with the doctor. 
__label__KIRK Any theories about what it is? 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK Obsessed? 
__label__KIRK No, no, no. I promise you. 
__label__KIRK No shields? 
__label__KIRK He's disappeared. It's almost as if he dematerialised. 
__label__KIRK Did you teach her that? 
__label__KIRK Damage report, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Set it and get up here as fast as you can. 
__label__KIRK Any indication of where that would be? 
__label__KIRK My brother's lab is over there. They signalled us once. There should be someone there. Let's find out what's happening. 
__label__KIRK Check co-ordinates. Is it the same area? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura.
__label__KIRK You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise? 
__label__KIRK Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else!
__label__KIRK How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him. 
__label__KIRK It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds. 
__label__KIRK They'll be all right. 
__label__KIRK He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even him. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK That's an order, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Then he was a very strange small boy. One the other hand, he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy. 
__label__KIRK Spock, will our combined phasers disrupt the field? 
__label__KIRK You  LANDRU: Landru, help me! 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Spock, work quietly. 
__label__KIRK Repeat, the ship is on Red Alert. There has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship's directional control.
__label__KIRK Where is he? 
__label__KIRK But Commander Bem's difficulty appears to be genuine. Phasers or not, we have to rescue him. We're going to have to follow them. 
__label__KIRK And you, Lokai, will die here in space. You'll inspire no more disciples. Your cause will be ended. 
__label__KIRK Mrs. Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you. I must speak to your husband. 
__label__KIRK Keep trying. 
__label__KIRK Mister Singh. Come here a moment. This unit will see to your needs. 
__label__KIRK You're sure, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Let's test it. (drinks the contents of a small vial) Nothing's happening. 
__label__KIRK I gave you an order, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on. 
__label__KIRK Interesting design. 
__label__KIRK Now we'll talk. 
__label__KIRK And your door will be closed. 
__label__KIRK Time factor. 
__label__KIRK But can't you duplicate it, Bones? Your medical computers have information on every procedure in the Federation's hospitals. 
__label__KIRK Oh, Harry. I do believe you're putting on weight. 
__label__KIRK This little thing? Just something I slipped on. 
__label__KIRK All hands, this is the captain. Stay at your posts. Remain calm.
__label__KIRK Establish two-way visual contact. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Mister Leslie. All channels cleared, Uhura?
__label__KIRK Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately. 
__label__KIRK Were you hurt? 
__label__KIRK He's no spy. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Any changes?
__label__KIRK Lesley. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. Go ahead, Bones. 
__label__KIRK I don't have a few minutes, Bones. Maybe none of us do. Let's go.
__label__KIRK Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Matt? Matt. 
__label__KIRK An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are?
__label__KIRK Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth. 
__label__KIRK You're doing fine. 
__label__KIRK And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern, you've asked the proper questions. You've both done your duty. Now may I ask what medical log entry you intend to make? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, lock in on our position. 
__label__KIRK It might be Gideon. 
__label__KIRK All stop. Hold position.
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel. I want to see what she looks like close up. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all decks. 
__label__KIRK Where is he? Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom?
__label__KIRK Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your well-known logic explain that? 
__label__KIRK Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us.
__label__KIRK Thanks, Scotty. Spread out. Find Commander Bem. He's split into three individual parts. 
__label__KIRK Who sent you here? 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. That was wrong of me. 
__label__KIRK Coming.
__label__KIRK We're not going to die. Now get off the bridge. 
__label__KIRK Yes, we've heard of it. I assumed it was a lost art. 
__label__KIRK Lights. (he films Eneg leaving) Thank you. Where does the Fuhrer enter? 
__label__KIRK Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock. 
__label__KIRK I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back. 
__label__KIRK I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack. 
__label__KIRK Maximum security. Is he so afraid? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. 
__label__KIRK They must have sensed a need and interpreted it as food. 
__label__KIRK We're blind here. What's it look like? 
__label__KIRK There may be something more effective, Mister Sulu. Kirk to Engineering. Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Tell Merikus I'd like to see him. 
__label__KIRK Get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on. 
__label__KIRK I'm not interested in eating, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK Bypass that analysis. We've got twenty nine minutes before we're too small to operate ship controls. Everyone continue to jury-rig miniature control mechanisms. There's nothing more we can do. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean? 
__label__KIRK By what? Are you happy here with Flint? 
__label__KIRK Well, I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to you. 
__label__KIRK There are casualties? 
__label__KIRK I don't think your parents liked it very much either. 
__label__KIRK Use the robot ship as a decoy. Have it change course and move off. We'll use it again to give the Klingons trouble. They can't control more than one ship at a time with their stasis field. 
__label__KIRK One of us must get him. 
__label__KIRK What's our position? 
__label__KIRK There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew. 
__label__KIRK Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there. It's vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history.
__label__KIRK That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth. 
__label__KIRK I can't just let him stay there. 
__label__KIRK I'm ready. 
__label__KIRK Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. We've contacted your buoy and understand its message. We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you. Lieutenant, answer? 
__label__KIRK On my way.
__label__KIRK Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time. 
__label__KIRK What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it  DECKER: Both or neither. I don't know. 
__label__KIRK What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No problems, no command decisions. Just living. 
__label__KIRK Direction, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion. 
__label__KIRK If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is that clear? 
__label__KIRK You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human emotional act? 
__label__KIRK Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to down here. We might as well finish it. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, the transporter room. 
__label__KIRK Oh, my goodness. Beautiful. Oh, Spock Spock! (Spock gets down)
__label__KIRK Co-ordinates? 
__label__KIRK We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless. Spock.
__label__KIRK Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is  MCCOY: No! Now. Right away. If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week eight days at the outside, he'll die. He'll die, Jim. 
__label__KIRK Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Right next to the dog-faced boy. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman? Where's that  ATKINS: Sir? 
__label__KIRK Klingons. 
__label__KIRK Launch probe. 
__label__KIRK That's not the way. 
__label__KIRK Move, move.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking. 
__label__KIRK That's a lie! 
__label__KIRK Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded? 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK What about it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Spock. Yes. 
__label__KIRK I've been packing some things, and I realise there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement.
__label__KIRK Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea may prove  SPOCK: Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum. 
__label__KIRK My plan exactly. Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course. It's the only reasonable explanation. You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you. 
__label__KIRK Take charge of the landing party, Mister Spock. I want some answers to all this.
__label__KIRK Our new heading, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK In Bela's office? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, change course to seventeen mark four, warp factor three. 
__label__KIRK Then reverse mutation is possible. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK What about the Phylosians? 
__label__KIRK I wonder how many generations have lived out their lives and been buried here without ever knowing that their world is hollow. 
__label__KIRK But if he had a reason, could he have done it? 
__label__KIRK Don't know yet. 
__label__KIRK Exactly what did I pass through? 
__label__KIRK Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem. 
__label__KIRK Put it on visual. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, sound alert. 
__label__KIRK That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves! 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture. Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for. 
__label__KIRK A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel? 
__label__KIRK Library computer. 
__label__KIRK Once more, Jose. Spock stated he received a message for us to come here. He entered same in his log. That's all the proof I require.
__label__KIRK I believe in honest relationships myself.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him? 
__label__KIRK Yes, what is it?
__label__KIRK Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons. 
__label__KIRK Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the death? 
__label__KIRK Bones' life is on the line, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You are stopping this? You? 
__label__KIRK I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he? 
__label__KIRK Bones, is it possible  MCCOY: Jim. 
__label__KIRK That's why we're here, Bones. Gentlemen, we'll travel light.
__label__KIRK Scotty, we've got ten minutes left. 
__label__KIRK What do you want? 
__label__KIRK Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK My ship is at stake. 
__label__KIRK Where's Tom? 
__label__KIRK A lot of it? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation. Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open.
__label__KIRK It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them? 
__label__KIRK Only the young Aquans? 
__label__KIRK (standing next to the symbols) Kirk to Enterprise. (and drops suddenly out of our sight) 
__label__KIRK Request denied.
__label__KIRK Spock. Bones. 
__label__KIRK Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Pipe it in. 
__label__KIRK Well, it makes it hard to teach you  CHARLIE: I don't want to do that. 
__label__KIRK Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main power banks. 
__label__KIRK Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt. Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level. 
__label__KIRK By killing seven innocent men. 
__label__KIRK We've got to try. We're helpless. See if it can do something. 
__label__KIRK My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz. 
__label__KIRK Are you ready? 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up. 
__label__KIRK There were bits of the plant in his mouth. 
__label__KIRK Lucien, you keep calling us friends, implying that you know us.
__label__KIRK Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble. 
__label__KIRK Antimatter seems our only possibility. 
__label__KIRK Exactly in some ways, different in others. 
__label__KIRK Federation. So was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in. 
__label__KIRK Inhospitable or not, he mustn't get away. 
__label__KIRK How's it going, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Prepare to beam aboard two parties, all human. 
__label__KIRK May I speak? 
__label__KIRK So are the people on Sherman's Planet. A little tribble doesn't eat much, a big tribble does. And these are growing. Jones, is this the ecological sabotage the Klingons are so mad about? 
__label__KIRK But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet. 
__label__KIRK Dr. McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind? 
__label__KIRK Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. 
__label__KIRK Yes. No malfunctions anywhere? (sees the Scalosians on the viewscreen) Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Couple of days. 
__label__KIRK So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it. Set up a landing party. Let's go get him. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?
__label__KIRK No drug? 
__label__KIRK What do you make of it, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't love her, but I do love her. And she loves me. 
__label__KIRK Ah, but the Romulans don't know that. Sure fooled the doctors. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?
__label__KIRK I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two. 
__label__KIRK I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy.
__label__KIRK Keep trying those controls, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too? 
__label__KIRK What do you want from me? 
__label__KIRK Well. 
__label__KIRK Yes, perfectly. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK We'll have to, Chief. The alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the Enterprise. A dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor. They're already screaming. Reactors closing down, life support systems  VANDERBERG: I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk. They're being murdered. You find that monster and kill it. 
__label__KIRK One of the many stories I've heard about you, Mister Winston.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK This ship is going to Ariannus. 
__label__KIRK No, thank you. 
__label__KIRK Personal log, stardate 3620.7. Have I the right to jeopardise my crew, my ship for a feeling I can't even put into words?
__label__KIRK We want to help you. 
__label__KIRK We? 
__label__KIRK Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago  MCCOY: You have a theory? 
__label__KIRK I must say, I like the styling. 
__label__KIRK I think you may also find you have a connection burning someplace. 
__label__KIRK Bring them in. 
__label__KIRK You saved my life down there. I want to thank you. 
__label__KIRK I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years  SPOCK: You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not? 
__label__KIRK The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons.
__label__KIRK But something was changed. 
__label__KIRK Bones, how much time? 
__label__KIRK We don't use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice. 
__label__KIRK Dismissed. 
__label__KIRK Notify Starbase Four that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and it will be returned along with its user as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus. 
__label__KIRK Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan. 
__label__KIRK I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your signal. Let's get back to our posts. Keep me advised. 
__label__KIRK And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it. 
__label__KIRK A trick, then? A projection? 
__label__KIRK The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must.
__label__KIRK Odd, Mister Spock. Very odd. Spock, you stay here with me.
__label__KIRK He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you. But there's more medicine aboard the ship. 
__label__KIRK Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither side can have. Bones. Bones, the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers. The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks. If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again. 
__label__KIRK What changed your mind about the Romulans? 
__label__KIRK Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now. 
__label__KIRK What's your name? 
__label__KIRK Do you think she understood me? 
__label__KIRK Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here. There are no Scalosians. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Very well. Reduce to sub-warp speed. Take us to Deneva. 
__label__KIRK That would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents. 
__label__KIRK I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes? 
__label__KIRK Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject. 
__label__KIRK I don't think so, Charlie. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties. The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid to you. 
__label__KIRK Think Spock can take him? 
__label__KIRK That makes sense. 
__label__KIRK How do you get the old knowledge? 
__label__KIRK There has to be an answer. 
__label__KIRK Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK We have no guarantees, but we have a good ship and the best crew in Starfleet. So do your jobs. Carry on. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, relay our position and circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately. 
__label__KIRK Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie.
__label__KIRK It's all right. It's all right. 
__label__KIRK Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we need a work crew with power tools to open a frozen door. Have them report to, report to  (Kirk starts giggling) 
__label__KIRK I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK Matthews, we'll look for Doctor Korby. Accompany us. 
__label__KIRK Ben! Ben, it's not too late. We can help you. 
__label__KIRK What are you? 
__label__KIRK This device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze. The unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. 
__label__KIRK Earth's not there. At least, not the Earth we know. We're totally alone.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, there's nothing there. 
__label__KIRK He was such a genius. What a waste. 
__label__KIRK We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner. 
__label__KIRK Mm-hmm.
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Buildings? 
__label__KIRK You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth. There are no witches. Why do you deny it? 
__label__KIRK You sent your own men into the arena? 
__label__KIRK Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out of your field, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, have you got that pilot yet? 
__label__KIRK Do you know the one, 'All I ask is a tall ship'? 
__label__KIRK Well, I won't strike you again. You've been following us, watching us. Why? 
__label__KIRK The Vedala changed their minds. The danger is past. Back to your stations. We have a lot of other places to go.  
__label__KIRK All right, what happened? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. They've all been answered. 
__label__KIRK Our universe. 
__label__KIRK We have little choice. 
__label__KIRK Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov? 
__label__KIRK You may be right, Bones. Maybe I shouldn't have gone in. She was blind, really blind. Really in the dark.
__label__KIRK Yes, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Are you in any condition to get up? 
__label__KIRK Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour? 
__label__KIRK Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived here? 
__label__KIRK Yes, she was all that. And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference. She was of great value. 
__label__KIRK Interesting. 
__label__KIRK What happened to the Keeper? 
__label__KIRK Someone special. A perfect specimen, perhaps. Yes, I've heard it too. 
__label__KIRK Spock, you don't know? 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know. 
__label__KIRK He fell from the console top. 
__label__KIRK What is that? 
__label__KIRK I understand you gave up a career in bio-research to sign aboard a starship.
__label__KIRK Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you are second in command. This will be a dangerous hunt. Either one of us by himself is expendable. Both of us are not. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk to all ship personnel. Red Alert. An attempt was made to murder Ambassador Kollos. The murderer is dangerously insane. He is Lawrence Marvick. Be on the watch for him. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Then we should be able to navigate back. 
__label__KIRK All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Krako. No deal. 
__label__KIRK If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference. It won't know more than it does now. 
__label__KIRK But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock. 
__label__KIRK We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mister Spock. Better give yourself a shot, Doc. 
__label__KIRK I'd be admitting a man died because  STONE: Admit nothing. Say nothing. Let me bury the matter here and now.
__label__KIRK We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off.
__label__KIRK This Khan is not what I expected of a twentieth century man. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty, what is it? 
__label__KIRK Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's alive. Maybe I can talk to it. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay. What did you do to her? 
__label__KIRK It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full dress uniforms.
__label__KIRK Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance. 
__label__KIRK What have you done? 
__label__KIRK Tapping its energy cells. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk.
__label__KIRK But how did he survive the plague? 
__label__KIRK Were they like this when you first came? 
__label__KIRK Try again.
__label__KIRK Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Describe it. 
__label__KIRK Why? How? Do you have any answers? 
__label__KIRK How bad is it? 
__label__KIRK Engineering. 
__label__KIRK Launch probe at zero acceleration. Forward thrust off, one tenth of a second. 
__label__KIRK It's locked onto my ship's systems. 
__label__KIRK I can understand her now, without the aid of the universal translator. 
__label__KIRK Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure? Intuition? 
__label__KIRK You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Mister Spock. Tell it we're trying to help. The mechanism. 
__label__KIRK This is, was, the control centre of the starship. These must be control and navigational instruments. 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Message to the inhabitants of the city on the planet below. I hope you can receive this frequency and understand my words. Your survival depends on it. All this ship's armament is locked on the co-ordinates of your city. A demonstration, in case you doubt. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, plot the course of the asteroid vessel. 
__label__KIRK You're leaving with the ship, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Without deflectors, we're just a clay pigeon for them. 
__label__KIRK You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere.
__label__KIRK What's its course? 
__label__KIRK Like what? 
__label__KIRK Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight,  CHEKOV: No, sir. 
__label__KIRK Captain Koloth was pretty emphatic. 
__label__KIRK I have given you new programming and you will implement it. 
__label__KIRK You can count on it. 
__label__KIRK All stations to immediate alert status. Stand by. 
__label__KIRK It seems to be. 
__label__KIRK But do you know what they were up to? 
__label__KIRK Yes. I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation. A source of water would stretch our survival. Did you see any evidence of rainfall? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, what about that tape? 
__label__KIRK You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Yes, but not without precautions. I'll keep my communicator channel open so you can hear what goes on. Keep the transporter locked on me, and if anything goes wrong, Scotty, I'm trusting you. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters? 
__label__KIRK Why should I work your side of the street? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I said that. 
__label__KIRK No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off.
__label__KIRK Not if I can help it. 
__label__KIRK We move on. 
__label__KIRK Before the appearance of whatever it is? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, is it you? 
__label__KIRK Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Yes. I never get involved with older women, Yeoman. Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Can you locate the intruder for us? 
__label__KIRK My dear Captain Koloth. 
__label__KIRK Have Mister Chekov lay in a course for a rendezvous with the Yorktown, maximum warp. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK Oh. I'm sorry. (he kisses it) Is that better? 
__label__KIRK Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests. 
__label__KIRK Reception committee? 
__label__KIRK Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam. You've established a receiver on board this vessel. Tighten your field to the interior of the ship. 
__label__KIRK All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a complete record of this. Mister Spock, what do we have on this general area?
__label__KIRK Mister Spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters. 
__label__KIRK Atmospheric controls cut off. 
__label__KIRK Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen. Set a course for Starbase Four. 
__label__KIRK Well, what did you expect from them? And what do you want from me? 
__label__KIRK Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me. (Takes his seat) But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of? 
__label__KIRK Nothing yet, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Anyone hurt? 
__label__KIRK Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death. 
__label__KIRK Courtesy is for everyone around here, and you'll find you won't be able to exist on Troyius without it. Mister Scott, our Chief Engineer, has shown you his engineering department. That's a courtesy.
__label__KIRK Are You certain about the time we have left? 
__label__KIRK I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable. 
__label__KIRK No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK We mean no desecration to the faith of Yonada. We must consult the book to help you. 
__label__KIRK I don't like it any more than you do, Spock, but there's nothing we can do about it. Kirk out,  (Everyone is holding hands around the brazier.) 
__label__KIRK I'll die anyway. Do it. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK There is one thing you can do. 
__label__KIRK There is a difference! Your trouble is in you. 
__label__KIRK Be careful. 
__label__KIRK No, but they may rest easier. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero three seven.
__label__KIRK I can't beam you down without further proof one way or the other.
__label__KIRK Go on. 
__label__KIRK Bones, what is it? 
__label__KIRK I can't afford to guess wrong. I've got to choose the right planet, get there, find the brain. Eight hours and thirty five minutes.
__label__KIRK If it's fighting that you want, (slaps Trelane) you may have it. 
__label__KIRK I'll see what I can  SPOCK: Captain, we're underway. 
__label__KIRK Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK In the hope that it will yank us out of the zone. Prepare yourselves. All right, Scotty. Let's get on with it. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, I would like  UHURA: Captain. It corrected itself. 
__label__KIRK See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.
__label__KIRK Any patrols? 
__label__KIRK Do it. 
__label__KIRK We've run out of time, Bones. No, wait. (to Daras, with a rifle)
__label__KIRK You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too.
__label__KIRK Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Well, here's your forge. People's exhibit number one. A chrome steel drill point. 
__label__KIRK Out of the question. Those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship. 
__label__KIRK Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship? 
__label__KIRK There's really something I don't understand about all of this.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers? 
__label__KIRK Or disobey an order from her. 
__label__KIRK Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK You're making this a rather one-sided conversation, Major. 
__label__KIRK Feminine. No doubt about it. 
__label__KIRK I don't know what your job is! You may set those controls so we can't detonate that warhead. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise, come in. 
__label__KIRK Where are we? 
__label__KIRK Mister Lurry, you issued a Priority One distress call. State the nature of your emergency. 
__label__KIRK Go on. 
__label__KIRK Hostages? For what purpose? 
__label__KIRK We're real enough. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean? 
__label__KIRK This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here. He probably wants additional advice.
__label__KIRK Serious? Serious, Bones? It upsets the whole percentage. 
__label__KIRK What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam, come ashore? 
__label__KIRK Let me see that. 
__label__KIRK It may be simpler than that. He may be drugged. We need McCoy. Is there a place, a room we can be alone for a few minutes? I'm going to send for help. 
__label__KIRK How? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Palmer. 
__label__KIRK Repeat. Federation orders to detain you for  SULU: They're veering off, sir. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, can you buy me some time. Get below and short out the main phaser couplings. They'll think the storm blew the stand-by circuits. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK We'll beam down. Alert security. Prepare to transport landing party to surface. We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals now being received.
__label__KIRK Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away. 
__label__KIRK All right. Reprimand received. Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK Spock said that? 
__label__KIRK Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the role of Satan? 
__label__KIRK Are you sure? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Commissioner? 
__label__KIRK Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right.
__label__KIRK This is the Captain speaking. In our next action, we can risk neither miscalculation nor error  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK (pushing the gear lever and making grinding noises) Oops! Gears. 
__label__KIRK Then you cannot let him die. 
__label__KIRK We've located the trouble. It shouldn't be much longer. 
__label__KIRK That's only one shield. 
__label__KIRK (shouting) Where? 
__label__KIRK Things any better down there? 
__label__KIRK We reach, Mister Spock.  
__label__KIRK I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK Ship to ship.
__label__KIRK Photographic section, begin scanning. Tie in to visual section 988-TG, computer bank 22. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings. Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told. 
__label__KIRK Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes prizes. 
__label__KIRK Not on my ship you don't. 
__label__KIRK Our pleasure, Captain. Bridge out. 
__label__KIRK You mean you froze? 
__label__KIRK And what of Lazarus? 
__label__KIRK I can't? 
__label__KIRK No visual contact, Mister Kelso? 
__label__KIRK Are you refusing a direct order? 
__label__KIRK I trust you.
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. Inform us  UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain, transporter circuits show someone preparing to beam down. 
__label__KIRK Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there? 
__label__KIRK I'm not leaving without my men. 
__label__KIRK I see. Magnification factor three, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Hundreds of thousands. 
__label__KIRK Kang. 
__label__KIRK Good, Commodore. We're on our way.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the distress call. Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now? 
__label__KIRK Come on, Doctor. McCoy. 
__label__KIRK You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it. 
__label__KIRK One? Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu?
__label__KIRK Is that what you want to do? 
__label__KIRK An apology? 
__label__KIRK Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own departments. No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down. We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer. 
__label__KIRK My orders were not to attempt a rescue under any condition. 
__label__KIRK Kang, do you read me? 
__label__KIRK Do you like her, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Either way, Mister Spock, it will hardly be our problem. 
__label__KIRK We have until five o'clock to find that way. Now consider this.
__label__KIRK I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford? 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and find out that you were living on a big ball. Not a planet, but a spaceship. And that knowledge seems to be forbidden. 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK Fisher saw? 
__label__KIRK No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Bones. Scotty. Spock's brain controls  MCCOY: It's not possible. 
__label__KIRK You're only half-Vulcan. What about the human half of you? 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches? 
__label__KIRK What sort of readings, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk.
__label__KIRK Is it permitted? 
__label__KIRK No. We were being chased by a policeman. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK (throwing down the whip.) I did. 
__label__KIRK Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres. 
__label__KIRK Commander of what? 
__label__KIRK All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit.
__label__KIRK Why not? 
__label__KIRK I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act. When was that? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no braid on my shoulder.
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Lamp. 
__label__KIRK Hydrogen cloud reflection? 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead. 
__label__KIRK I promise, beloved. 
__label__KIRK How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right to hand out life and death? 
__label__KIRK Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it. You want to commit murder? Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. (the pair are beamed off) 
__label__KIRK You have the conn, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK McCoy! McCoy! 
__label__KIRK (referring to viewscreen) If you believe that, we have. 
__label__KIRK Maybe you can. Tell me the rest. You were fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out of there. 
__label__KIRK Gothos? Mister Sulu, have we been going in circles? 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK We've armed man with tools. The striving for greatness continues.
__label__KIRK Any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam? 
__label__KIRK I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the power to defend ourselves. If you value your safety, release this ship.
__label__KIRK You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop thinking with your glands. We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a body. Transporter room, Kirk speaking. Three to beam up.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Report, Spock. 
__label__KIRK I order you to report to the Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK (having to be held back by the guards) I'll kill you, you filthy traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK We try, sir. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, it worked. Great. (sees that maw turning towards them) I think it's great. Scotty, get us out of here. 
__label__KIRK There used to be only two examining tables in this room. Now there are three. 
__label__KIRK We shoot together. 
__label__KIRK We'll do our best. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK 20th century Earth. 'All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer by'. You could feel the wind at your back in those days. The sounds of the sea beneath you. And even if you take away the wind and the water, it's still the same. The ship is yours. You can feel her.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the moment  SPOCK: I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action.
__label__KIRK Then it's a device. You do use tools. 
__label__KIRK His what? 
__label__KIRK Are you the new security officer? 
__label__KIRK Where did they go? 
__label__KIRK I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him. 
__label__KIRK But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus? 
__label__KIRK Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality. 
__label__KIRK How long would you like it to last? 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Listen to me. 
__label__KIRK No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old. 
__label__KIRK Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead. 
__label__KIRK Now I know why it's called she.
__label__KIRK What is it, Ensign? 
__label__KIRK Bones, what do you make of it? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady. 
__label__KIRK It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK We can't do that. Perhaps you know his name. Merik. Captain Merik. 
__label__KIRK Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity. Without creativity, there is no life. The body dies. The fault is yours. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard. 
__label__KIRK What else do they know about us? 
__label__KIRK Cry out and I'll break it. Don't move. 
__label__KIRK I don't mean that. I'm getting a Red Alert right here. (the back of his head) That thing is dangerous. I feel. (hesitates) Only a fool would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress. You have my psychological profiles. Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer? 
__label__KIRK Doc, I don't want to hurt you. 
__label__KIRK Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. 
__label__KIRK Never mind that. We've got to get Spock out of here before Keniclius returns. Scott should have the Enterprise back by now. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Nothing. Must be these blasted walls again. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK I couldn't. 
__label__KIRK All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Status report on the damaged grain ship, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK That's a very interesting theory. The yellow civilisation is almost destroyed, the white civilisation is destroyed. Keep working on the window if we're ever going to regain our freedom. 
__label__KIRK Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, lock in on us. Medical emergency. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Preserve. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what happened to you? 
__label__KIRK Further than that, if I'm successful. 
__label__KIRK We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection. 
__label__KIRK I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty.
__label__KIRK Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to leave the ship.
__label__KIRK Report, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Keep pouring it on, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Disengage this computer now. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better place?
__label__KIRK Scotty, any records, log books of any kind? 
__label__KIRK That'll take us out of the galaxy. 
__label__KIRK Bridge. Helm. 
__label__KIRK Kol-Tai. Doctor McCoy, do you remember him? 
__label__KIRK Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec. Status, legal ward after the death of her parents. 
__label__KIRK Don't worry about me. They may have hurt her. 
__label__KIRK Bones! Spock! 
__label__KIRK You will remind me to report my conduct to the Federation, won't you Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK There are no administrative duties required here. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Hold it! Over there. You, over there. Move, move, move. 
__label__KIRK Sulu, get down to Engineering. 
__label__KIRK And Professor Crater and wife? 
__label__KIRK Can you identify that metal, or the design of the ship? 
__label__KIRK It's one of the possibilities we've discussed. (to Vanderberg) I want your people to stay on the top level, together at a safe place. 
__label__KIRK A what? 
__label__KIRK We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs. 
__label__KIRK Dead. I don't understand it. My phaser wasn't set to kill. 
__label__KIRK His father helped me get into the Academy. 
__label__KIRK Not about tribbles, anyway. I am concerned about that new Klingon weapon. 
__label__KIRK Anything at all? 
__label__KIRK Very short. 
__label__KIRK Thanks. I wonder what they're doing to Doc. 
__label__KIRK But there is earth-type vegetation. 
__label__KIRK But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived?
__label__KIRK Why should he? We haven't contacted him, so we must not have detected him. He'd have to explain an attack. Besides, he'll probably prefer to sneak aboard, seeing that we carelessly left the hangar doors open. 
__label__KIRK I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I want to talk to her, too. 
__label__KIRK Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the universe. No, not a hole, A door. 
__label__KIRK Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit. 
__label__KIRK Doc! 
__label__KIRK What do you care as long as you're being cut in? Course, there's always Bela Oxmyx. 
__label__KIRK That's exactly what I was going to ask.
__label__KIRK I'm afraid so.
__label__KIRK (with children and communicators) Three hours, eleven minutes left. Thank you, Lieutenant. Keep this channel open. Clear your computers. What happened to him? 
__label__KIRK Carry on your work? 
__label__KIRK I said, get back to the ship. Ensign, I gave you an order. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. Notify all hands to return to stations. All right, let's take her out. Warp factor two. 
__label__KIRK You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll. Try that. 
__label__KIRK Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and the lives of millions like you. If you help me, maybe I can do it. If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on. Or are you that fond of the war?
__label__KIRK Energise, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Scotty? Security, the intruder is in the engineering section. Have all units converge on that point. 
__label__KIRK What caused it?
__label__KIRK But that blow on the head. It could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm ready. Kirk to Security. I want a guard maintained on Doctor Sevrin until further notice. Bones, how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection? 
__label__KIRK A fat tribble. 
__label__KIRK Where? 
__label__KIRK How long can Spock last without the drug? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's loyalty. If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats. 
__label__KIRK I'm fine, Bones. The cat's last power jolt clipped me. 
__label__KIRK Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you. 
__label__KIRK (removing one of her long gloves) I don't want you accepting his gifts, either. 
__label__KIRK Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports on our position and status. 
__label__KIRK Evasive action. 
__label__KIRK Speed, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK You forbid me after what you've done to my people? 
__label__KIRK Set course for Delta Vega.
__label__KIRK Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you picking up? 
__label__KIRK What did you see? 
__label__KIRK Well, those are stars. And around them are planets. And there are people that live on them, Just like us. 
__label__KIRK Ben Finney. 
__label__KIRK Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we can do for you, Captain? Medical supplies, provisions? 
__label__KIRK Spock. Bones. Where are we? 
__label__KIRK Where do we find him? 
__label__KIRK Life readings, Doctor McCoy? 
__label__KIRK If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it.
__label__KIRK Emergency manual monitor, report. 
__label__KIRK An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern. 
__label__KIRK What is? 
__label__KIRK Now, Cloud William. 
__label__KIRK All right, Nomad. Repair the unit. 
__label__KIRK Not really. 
__label__KIRK Good. Going back to marked headings. 
__label__KIRK Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment. You know what to do. 
__label__KIRK Mister Walking Bear, do the legends say what happened to Kukulkan? 
__label__KIRK A natural phenomenon. But what? Duty personnel on Yellow Alert.
__label__KIRK They wouldn't. 
__label__KIRK Of course. It had to be. Landru. 
__label__KIRK There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was true. 
__label__KIRK Incredible. 
__label__KIRK Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities? 
__label__KIRK I'm delighted to hear that, Chief. Once Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you people are going to be embarrassingly rich. 
__label__KIRK Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left. 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. 
__label__KIRK I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I can't remember. 
__label__KIRK It's faster than walking. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that?
__label__KIRK Excuse me. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Our impulse engines have been shut down. We'll maintain orbit by momentum. 
__label__KIRK Inoperative. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something. 
__label__KIRK Then we'll beam back up. 
__label__KIRK Try and get me a fix on the Galileo. 
__label__KIRK Comet Icarus four. Composition? 
__label__KIRK Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you. 
__label__KIRK Take evasive action, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come in. Mister Spock, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, where's that power? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, aim for the propulsion units of the lead Romulan vessel. Prepare to fire phasers and photon torpedoes in combination. 
__label__KIRK Then you know that nothing can be done. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK It's very old. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean, absorbed? 
__label__KIRK Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes  BOY: Who you callin' a babe? 
__label__KIRK Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel. That's only a matter of judgment. 
__label__KIRK Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.
__label__KIRK All this. Self-inflicted. Mass suicide. 
__label__KIRK In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner. 
__label__KIRK You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not under arrest. In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own. 
__label__KIRK How much time do we have? 
__label__KIRK Stay on it, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Childress. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, transporter room. Full medical gear. 
__label__KIRK We agree. 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK We must go. 
__label__KIRK Acknowledge, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK How long does the knowledge last? 
__label__KIRK Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions.
__label__KIRK M-5 is committed. 
__label__KIRK Or of fear. 
__label__KIRK Stay with her, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Great leader. Great leader! (He kneels in front of Kara.) We come from a far place to learn from your Controller. 
__label__KIRK We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human.
__label__KIRK Let's take the facts one by one. That should explain something. 
__label__KIRK And you don't recommend sticking around.
__label__KIRK Oh, yes it does, Spock. (further along) Keep concentrating, Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Not a word, Mister Cochrane. 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centuri, the discoverer of the space warp? 
__label__KIRK Young man, run along and play. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it? 
__label__KIRK Stand by your phasers, Mister Spock. Prepare to fire on my signal. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Ahead warp factor two.  
__label__KIRK What was that? 
__label__KIRK You must get us in there. 
__label__KIRK You can't explain your presence on the base. 
__label__KIRK That's a great help, Mister Chekov. Bones? 
__label__KIRK Bring him along. 
__label__KIRK Sound warning for collision. Red Alert. 
__label__KIRK Fine. Right now why don't we all eat up before our food gets cold. 
__label__KIRK Spock, prepare to fire phasers. 
__label__KIRK Stay on top of it, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK It never makes any sense. We both have to know that there was a reason. 
__label__KIRK After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons? 
__label__KIRK It will take a lot longer than that, Commander. 
__label__KIRK Explain, Spock. 
__label__KIRK What is it, Bones? 
__label__KIRK No. You are living inside a hollow ball. Your ancestors created it to take you on a journey to a promised new planet. 
__label__KIRK Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman. 
__label__KIRK One of those was in the Academy? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Vanna. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock! 
__label__KIRK Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise from Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Yes, go on. 
__label__KIRK I'll buy speculation.
__label__KIRK And old. And rapidly growing older. 
__label__KIRK the mistake Van Gelder made.
__label__KIRK Open all channels. Captain to crew. Repairs are now being effected by Mister Spock. The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately. 
__label__KIRK I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes, get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone. The landing party is expendable. The Enterprise isn't. Kirk out. Miramanee.
__label__KIRK Does she answer a hail? 
__label__KIRK What about those blobs, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Security guard. 
__label__KIRK No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound. 
__label__KIRK One of the missing scientists? 
__label__KIRK Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks. What about Mister Sulu? Will he confirm what you saw?
__label__KIRK We don't have any other facts, any information. 
__label__KIRK That pyramid seems to be the centre of everything. I'm going up there. The rest of you spread out and circle it. 
__label__KIRK As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports. 
__label__KIRK Is the crew in danger? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise to Orion vessel. I have a proposal to make. If you do have the Huron's cargo, there were some perishable drugs in it that we desperately need. 
__label__KIRK I'm glad you're alive. 
__label__KIRK Tchar, be careful. We need you, too. 
__label__KIRK I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of career. 
__label__KIRK Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. What could have happened? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I think you might. Turn in your glass slippers. The ball is over. 
__label__KIRK Nomad, you are imperfect! 
__label__KIRK Thank you.
__label__KIRK I would like to have met Doctor Adams. Have you ever been to a penal colony since they started following his theories?
__label__KIRK Can't you get to the auxiliary?
__label__KIRK Then get moving. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there. And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there. Let's go.
__label__KIRK Help Chekov. 
__label__KIRK And there are guards every few feet down the hall. 
__label__KIRK That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you must go to Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK When can we beam down, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Did they leave any other books? 
__label__KIRK Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No treaties have ever been signed. Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured. There are no extradition procedures to allow it. Is that clear, Commissioner Bele? 
__label__KIRK Bridge, this is the Captain. What's happened? 
__label__KIRK Deflectors on, Mister Farrell. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise, do you read me? 
__label__KIRK Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations. 
__label__KIRK Kollos knows what's in your heart. You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos. 
__label__KIRK Any damage to the warp engines? 
__label__KIRK For what purpose have you imprisoned us here? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction.
__label__KIRK What other choice is there? 
__label__KIRK We're still here. Lieutenant Uhura, can you get us a visual? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Don't you believe in male androids, Harry? 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this planet?
__label__KIRK In a hurry to see me go? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to transporter room. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. Scotty's dead. He had too much happiness. But now he's happier he's dead, and we'll miss him. Let us hear it for our poor, dead friend. 
__label__KIRK We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her. 
__label__KIRK I never could talk you into anything. All right. Fire away. 
__label__KIRK Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako.
__label__KIRK Hmm. I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that, or find him one.
__label__KIRK It's sad. Think what we could have done with his knowledge. But the price was just too high. 
__label__KIRK Ship's course? 
__label__KIRK Like yourselves. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one day. Shall we have a look around? 
__label__KIRK Nice to know the crew is efficient in this time plane, too.
__label__KIRK You're the enemy? 
__label__KIRK Right. 
__label__KIRK What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe. I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart. 
__label__KIRK Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to abandon.
__label__KIRK All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you. 
__label__KIRK Now, now, Mister Spock, you're not trying to scare our Dramian friend, are you? Of course, you can back out if you'd like, Commander. 
__label__KIRK Scotty? 
__label__KIRK You're the government here? 
__label__KIRK Let it also read that I consider it invalid. 
__label__KIRK Miranda, I meant no insult. Please. Here we are among the roses.
__label__KIRK Long range sensor scan, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators? 
__label__KIRK She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she's human. The human spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she wishes. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK But that's not the way it happened.
__label__KIRK Well, followers can be led. Let's hope we can be as persuasive as Keniclius. 
__label__KIRK Trouble? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James Kirk. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy and Mister Sulu. You seem to have been expecting us. 
__label__KIRK Both will kill. 
__label__KIRK The M-5 computer is now disengaged. 
__label__KIRK Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage. Mister Spock, it is time. The explosive. 
__label__KIRK Well, we took the risk, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive.
__label__KIRK What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Explain yourself, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum  OXMYX: I ain't interested in your orders. From now on, you're gonna take orders from me. I'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things I want. If I don't have those tools by then, I'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in a box. Is that understood, pal? 
__label__KIRK What's going on down there? 
__label__KIRK I said we're not going anywhere. 
__label__KIRK I know, Bones, but there's nothing I can do about it. 
__label__KIRK We have nothing to discuss. 
__label__KIRK Those were all acts carried out by our attacker. 
__label__KIRK Energise.
__label__KIRK Yes, we did, Mister Spock. I think we did.
__label__KIRK All the best. 
__label__KIRK Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone on board? This is the Captain. 
__label__KIRK McCoy has somehow changed history. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, how are you coming with that information on Keniclius? 
__label__KIRK Why you? 
__label__KIRK You seem more like a boy.
__label__KIRK Scotty, take them to the briefing room. 
__label__KIRK That's taped music, sir. A starship on active duty never carries an honour detachment. 
__label__KIRK What alternative? 
__label__KIRK This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts.
__label__KIRK Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years. (realisation dawns) I did enjoy it. The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to beat the tar out of Finnegan.
__label__KIRK No, this is not off the record. 
__label__KIRK We're on a thousand planets and spreading out. We cross fantastic distances and everything's alive, Cochrane. Life everywhere. We estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life. We haven't begun to map them. Interesting? 
__label__KIRK It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear. 
__label__KIRK Spock, you tell them. 
__label__KIRK She's not Nancy, Bones.
__label__KIRK Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what? 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Don't you have a mate? 
__label__KIRK No sign of the spaceship. No sign of debris. 
__label__KIRK The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere. And I haven't seen Scotty in hours. 
__label__KIRK Why aren't our sensors picking it up? Forward scanners, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out. violently. 
__label__KIRK She might have killed someone. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. A moment, if you please. 
__label__KIRK The time warp. What did it do to us?
__label__KIRK Miramanee! No! Miramanee! 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Arex, activate main screen, extreme magnification. 
__label__KIRK Lead us to him. 
__label__KIRK Find the man at the other end of the phone  [Transporter room]
__label__KIRK Spock, is that you? 
__label__KIRK (answers communicator) Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK But they're still out there. 
__label__KIRK Did I, Mister Spock? They've been killing three million people a year. It had been going on for five hundred years. An actual attack wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war. The fighting would have been over permanently. 
__label__KIRK It seems to have some sort of anatomy. Arex, where are we on that chart? 
__label__KIRK What took you so long, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK I make no deals for control of this ship, sir. 
__label__KIRK I said beam me aboard. 
__label__KIRK Or I will be killed. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Concentrate on the underside of the neck. 
__label__KIRK It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential. 
__label__KIRK You must help us. You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken. 
__label__KIRK Sit down. (McCoy enters) What happened? 
__label__KIRK Why did you kill that man? 
__label__KIRK I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise. Once there, no tricks. 
__label__KIRK To prevent any further trouble, I want you to shut down all logic functions until we can get a handle on the problem. 
__label__KIRK Switch to impulse.
__label__KIRK Yes, and congratulations. What took you so long? 
__label__KIRK Come on. 
__label__KIRK But you haven't won anything. 
__label__KIRK Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you. Mister Spock, you have the conn.
__label__KIRK Reverse the machine, Keniclius. 
__label__KIRK What is it, Spock? 
__label__KIRK A calculated risk, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy. 
__label__KIRK Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy. With another difference. This one is crowded. 
__label__KIRK No! We can't! 
__label__KIRK Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that? 
__label__KIRK Don't make your pick-up here. 
__label__KIRK Alexander. 
__label__KIRK Keep trying. 
__label__KIRK For years, I've loved you. 
__label__KIRK Security, hold it. Tricorder. 
__label__KIRK We didn't. 
__label__KIRK Gary. Gary, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied. 
__label__KIRK But what, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK I shall be in my quarters. Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy and Mister Scott meet me there. 
__label__KIRK Nona. Pardon me. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, do you still have phaser power? 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Scott, energise. 
__label__KIRK Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to understand. All you have is printed circuits. 
__label__KIRK Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to another planet. And these are their descendants. (Once the coast is clear.) Now. 
__label__KIRK I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with me? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Can you bridge to your setup? 
__label__KIRK Plasus is not the whole government. 
__label__KIRK That was an order, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency two. 
__label__KIRK Yes, my world and your world of Yonada. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, enjoy yourself.
__label__KIRK What's the imposed course, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK That's not so. He was my friend. 
__label__KIRK Anything, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Stay there. 
__label__KIRK Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing. (another hit) Source, Spock. 
__label__KIRK And the Toltec's Quetzalcoatl, the Chinese dragon and all the rest. But not quite a god. Just an old, lonely being who wanted to help others. 
__label__KIRK Sam Cogley had gone a shore to bring Jamie Finney on board.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant! 
__label__KIRK Some doctors have all the luck. 
__label__KIRK Do it. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Circuit shorting. 
__label__KIRK Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready. 
__label__KIRK All right, you people, clear out of the way. 
__label__KIRK A ship. Yes, a ship for Triacus. But why? By whom? (into comm.)
__label__KIRK Wait. I can prove we're telling the truth. A small device. I'll take it out slowly. (his communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron. Spock was shot with a flintlock. How many centuries between those two developments? 
__label__KIRK Forgive me, Mister Spock. I should have known better. 
__label__KIRK Address intercraft. 
__label__KIRK Donald, good to see you. 
__label__KIRK Astronomical section reports that a comet recently passed by.
__label__KIRK Normally, no, but that blow on his head could  SCOTT: No, Captain. 
__label__KIRK The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside.
__label__KIRK Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip under us. 
__label__KIRK What about Lars? 
__label__KIRK Meaningless at the moment, Bones, but it was sent twice. Odds against that occurring in a totally random transmission are too high to ignore. There may be some intelligence trying to contact us. Mister Spock, continue research on the word terratin. 
__label__KIRK He's in Sickbay. Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise, you're bound by its regulations. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you tell McCoy that she had better check out as the best assistant I ever had. Energise.
__label__KIRK Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
__label__KIRK There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be a way! 
__label__KIRK I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while. 
__label__KIRK You're lying! 
__label__KIRK Store our shuttlecraft on the hangar deck, Mister Scott. Beam us directly aboard.
__label__KIRK If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today I  MARLA: I know, sir. I'm sorry. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure? 
__label__KIRK It's not that bad. 
__label__KIRK Auxiliary power. 
__label__KIRK Maybe they had help. Maximum orbit. Take us out of range of their detection range. 
__label__KIRK Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business. 
__label__KIRK What's our reading, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, get Daystrom up here. Disengaging M-5 unit. Cut speed to warp one. Navigator, go to course one one three mark seven. I want that ship given a wide berth. 
__label__KIRK I can't for the life of me imagine which one. 
__label__KIRK Open a hailing frequency Lieutenant M'Ress. 
__label__KIRK Consider it Job security. 
__label__KIRK I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation. 
__label__KIRK You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now? 
__label__KIRK And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK You want to make a deal. 
__label__KIRK Kelowitz, Lang, flank out. Lay down fire on co-ordinates Mister Spock gave you. Even if you don't see them. Keep your heads down.
__label__KIRK But only a machine, Mister Spock. The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Set for a single elliptic orbit. 
__label__KIRK Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there. 
__label__KIRK Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Very good, Mister Chekov. Thank you, Mister Leslie. 
__label__KIRK Sensor readings, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy. 
__label__KIRK Do it. 
__label__KIRK No. No, I'm not. 
__label__KIRK Where?
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Wait a minute. There is a method to this madness. 
__label__KIRK Who have you come for? Form a circle. You see? You'd better tell us. Tell us. Who have you come for?
__label__KIRK Go through the transporter, both of us. 
__label__KIRK Plot the course, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Kang, there's something important I must discuss with you. 
__label__KIRK Is it gone? 
__label__KIRK What's that? Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible. 
__label__KIRK Doesn't sound like the man I know.
__label__KIRK This communicator's been on my belt since we beamed down. 
__label__KIRK Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire! 
__label__KIRK Slow down. Slow down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We've covered over two miles. Can we take a breather? A rest? 
__label__KIRK Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal? 
__label__KIRK You traitor. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! 
__label__KIRK Okay. 
__label__KIRK You'd be the last one I'd tell. (sees light, goes to desk monitor) Kirk here. What's going on?
__label__KIRK Where are you going? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Take a look around, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Because a flaw developed in the controls. And unless we correct it, Yonada will kill millions of people and destroy a world it doesn't even know. 
__label__KIRK Where I was born. Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky?
__label__KIRK You conceal it very well. Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in. Mister Chekov, a nice, straight line. Don't waste any time. 
__label__KIRK Nomad, stop what you're doing. Scotty? 
__label__KIRK And what would be the point? 
__label__KIRK Mister Baris  BARIS: And I'm through being intimidated, Kirk. You have insulted me, you have ignored me, you've walked all over me. You have abused your authority, and you've rejected my requests. And this, this is the result. I'm going to hold you responsible. 
__label__KIRK Who? 
__label__KIRK If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all. 
__label__KIRK Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, did you see what I think I just saw? 
__label__KIRK The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions. Where's Chekov? 
__label__KIRK I hope I'm not crowding you. 
__label__KIRK Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting.
__label__KIRK Bones? You could stop all this by saying no. That's why I called you all here together. We'll all be deeply involved. It must be unanimous. 
__label__KIRK We'll fight if we have to. Sulu, are we headed for the exact co-ordinates where the Klothos disappeared? 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Ben. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. Let's have a look at the projector. 
__label__KIRK Ahead, warp factor two. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK No. I need the help. In there, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five. 
__label__KIRK The power source. Shielded by solid rock.
__label__KIRK Something? You mean someone. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, how much power do we have left? 
__label__KIRK Try and stop him. It's better if I go with him. 
__label__KIRK We do. We want to find them. Take us there and we'll let you go. 
__label__KIRK Can you do it in time? 
__label__KIRK Spock, are you in the library? 
__label__KIRK Quiet. 
__label__KIRK Come with me. I offer you happiness. 
__label__KIRK Three against three. We may never get a better chance. 
__label__KIRK Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to maintain orbit. We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here. 
__label__KIRK When I was a cadet at the Academy, his exploits were required reading. He was one of my heroes. I'd like to see him. 
__label__KIRK Do you know the plan of this building? 
__label__KIRK I've got to go. 
__label__KIRK All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater explain what happened to his wife. (to Uhura) Remember my instructions, Lieutenant. Keep a tight fix on us. If we let out a yell I want an armed party down there before the echo dies. 
__label__KIRK That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered. 
__label__KIRK It'll be nice to play diplomat for a change, eh, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Mister Bailey, phaser crews were sluggish. You were slow in locking them into your directional beam. Helmsman, engineering decks could have been faster, too. Programme a series of simulated attacks and evasion maneuvers. Keep repeating the exercise until we're proficient, gentlemen.
__label__KIRK Not yet. They may trace our beam. Wait until we're well out of range. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Dead. And you'll find every red corpuscle gone from their body. 
__label__KIRK Flood all decks with neural gas. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mister Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship. Stand by communications. Mister Spock. If you don't receive a message from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once. No turning back. 
__label__KIRK Come on. It's all right. Come on. 
__label__KIRK (dictating log) Since exploration and contact with alien intelligences is our primary mission, I've decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact. Log entry out. How long before Starfleet receives that?
__label__KIRK We know that someone or something killed three women. If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else. Something driven to kill. 
__label__KIRK Negative. 
__label__KIRK Can you rig one up? It's vital. 
__label__KIRK After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive. 
__label__KIRK It's worth a try. (into communicator) Kirk to alien intelligence.
__label__KIRK Reverse course. One hundred and eighty degrees about. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I want you to run a survey, a complete survey of the planet using all ship's available instruments. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Alexander. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating personnel. You can't  TRELANE: I can do anything I want. I should think you would have realised that by now. 
__label__KIRK Well, I'll be  SPOCK: I suggest compliance, Captain. 
__label__KIRK Nomad was destroyed. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship's out of danger. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Bones, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Which one of you is Tongo Rad? 
__label__KIRK I don't believe it. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least for the present. I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six. 
__label__KIRK Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing.
__label__KIRK What the blazes is going on? 
__label__KIRK You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. (McCoy enters) But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you. 
__label__KIRK Well, opinions? 
__label__KIRK Spock. Where's Spock? 
__label__KIRK We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you.
__label__KIRK Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it. 
__label__KIRK Can you tell me what happened?
__label__KIRK Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll talk! Guard! Guard, I'll talk! 
__label__KIRK Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant.
__label__KIRK What have I done? (to Mara) There's an alien entity aboard the ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to. We don't know what its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us. Take me to Kang. A temporary truce, that's all I ask. Spock, take her. 
__label__KIRK Scotty.
__label__KIRK You don't have a schedule now, do you? 
__label__KIRK Identical. Earth, as it was in the early 1900s. 
__label__KIRK Engineering, then ion pod. 
__label__KIRK Where are you? 
__label__KIRK We've lost her trail, but she went into that system. Mister Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen. 
__label__KIRK Why did you let him do it? 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk to Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK What is this, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Back into your body. We brought it along with us. 
__label__KIRK I'll see what we can do. 
__label__KIRK Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of this era's greatest problems? 
__label__KIRK Are we in an alternate universe? 
__label__KIRK Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned. We find you out here, where no human has any business being. We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here.
__label__KIRK Yes. Very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately. Beam us a signal so we can home in on you. 
__label__KIRK Yes, for McCoy's sake. And for Kol-Tai's sake too. You see, Commander, we do place a value on life. All life. Does that shock you, Commander? 
__label__KIRK It was rather warm. 
__label__KIRK A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge. And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and double the food supply. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK A piece of the action. 
__label__KIRK In this building? 
__label__KIRK Go climb a tree. 
__label__KIRK Stand by phasers. 
__label__KIRK (over Chekov's speech) Lieutenant Uhura, all decks (rest of speech lost under Chekov's increasing volume) 
__label__KIRK You seem to be singing a different tune. I'd rather know more about yours. You call it magic, you call it science. It seems unrelated to both of them. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying. 
__label__KIRK She was breathing our air. She must've gone to one of them. Show us the three Class-M planets. Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Put them on intercom. 
__label__KIRK Your findings? 
__label__KIRK I understand. 
__label__KIRK Then watch him. Hang on to being a human for one minute longer. 
__label__KIRK I thought  we left you on the robot planet, Harry. Permanently. 
__label__KIRK He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us. 
__label__KIRK You must help me Before it goes too far. 
__label__KIRK Then you and I are transporting down. 
__label__KIRK Who is it? Can you tell? 
__label__KIRK It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now.  
__label__KIRK Hold on. Bones, could something be making me hallucinate? 
__label__KIRK Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale. 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer. 
__label__KIRK Jim will do here, Janice. 
__label__KIRK Spock. (he wakes) Doctor McCoy. Bones. Bones? 
__label__KIRK Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now. 
__label__KIRK Isn't that enough for one lifetime? 
__label__KIRK Impossible. 
__label__KIRK Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here. I wonder what alerted it the first time. 
__label__KIRK He may be turning to fight.
__label__KIRK Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something you couldn't do yourself!
__label__KIRK But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet? 
__label__KIRK What did you say your name was?
__label__KIRK If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us. 
__label__KIRK Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut eleven years ago. 
__label__KIRK No, I think Colonel Green is right. That rock-like thing is our enemy, not those illusions. 
__label__KIRK You mean to tell me you've called me three light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being Kodos? 
__label__KIRK You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford. Whatever that thing is outside, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Enough to turn it off course? 
__label__KIRK Sensor report, Mister Spock. Are they at the rendezvous point? 
__label__KIRK Get out of here! Hurry! 
__label__KIRK No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost. 
__label__KIRK I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred. 
__label__KIRK (draws his phaser) This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant. 
__label__KIRK All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge. Keep me posted.
__label__KIRK Did you say it hovered? 
__label__KIRK Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With that kind of power consumption, they may not be able to see us. 
__label__KIRK What is that thing? 
__label__KIRK Maintain thrust, Scotty. While we're maintaining our distance, Mister Spock, have you ascertained yet what we're maintaining our distance from? 
__label__KIRK Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Hold present course. Slow to warp one. 
__label__KIRK That was the order, helmsman. 
__label__KIRK Source? 
__label__KIRK Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn. 
__label__KIRK Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor? 
__label__KIRK Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't operate without transfusions from Spock. I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here. As soon as he leaves the bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters. Will that fill your prescription?
__label__KIRK Yes, say it, Bones. 
__label__KIRK May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura. 
__label__KIRK Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report. 
__label__KIRK Captain here. Put McCoy on. 
__label__KIRK Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners. 
__label__KIRK Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.
__label__KIRK I'll say. Spock, this is  SPOCK: Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir? 
__label__KIRK Coming.
__label__KIRK Fascinating. But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara. 
__label__KIRK What was said and what happened between us was for us alone. 
__label__KIRK Spock, find anything? 
__label__KIRK I agree. 
__label__KIRK Starfleet. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK If you don't allow me to bring Doctor McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her. 
__label__KIRK The old impulse engines weren't strong enough. 
__label__KIRK I'm not joking. 
__label__KIRK Bones, how is it? 
__label__KIRK Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. I want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for Starbase Four. 
__label__KIRK Good. Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Is not to be injured. 
__label__KIRK Directed at what? 
__label__KIRK I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man. 
__label__KIRK And you bore it well. And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault. And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the USS Yorktown. 
__label__KIRK You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him. 
__label__KIRK It's necessary. 
__label__KIRK You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. But at least they're alive. 
__label__KIRK Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the others. I was the one who shot out your mirror machine. 
__label__KIRK William Claiborne, that's right. 
__label__KIRK Yes, art is the population's chief occupation. 
__label__KIRK Good. Now, if you don't mind telling  EVE: Hello. 
__label__KIRK If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your business, but you're no god to us, Mister. 
__label__KIRK Is the alien still making warp five? 
__label__KIRK I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts? 
__label__KIRK We'll get you out, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Go? 
__label__KIRK I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned. Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Everyone all right? 
__label__KIRK We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada. 
__label__KIRK Does everybody know about this wheat but me? 
__label__KIRK Ensign Chekov, Lieutenant Uhura, and I will beam down and make a routine check of its facilities. 
__label__KIRK What happened to him, Charlie? 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to transporter control centre on the planet. 
__label__KIRK Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio. Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy. They didn't have subspace communication in those days. 
__label__KIRK The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of her. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK But this is not the centre, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder.
__label__KIRK The signal? A distress call, wasn't it? 
__label__KIRK Auxiliary. 
__label__KIRK I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened. 
__label__KIRK Think it over, Mister Cochrane. There's a whole galaxy out there waiting to honour you. 
__label__KIRK As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin. 
__label__KIRK But nothing in the computer banks about surface eruptions.
__label__KIRK There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva. There's more than one hundred thousand in this city alone. Where is everyone? 
__label__KIRK Form a ring. Fire! 
__label__KIRK Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife. 
__label__KIRK Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only. If only.  
__label__KIRK You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator. 
__label__KIRK Mister Walking Bear, how do you know who's aboard that ship? 
__label__KIRK The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be landing there. 
__label__KIRK And we'll forget about a certain stowaway. 
__label__KIRK Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the transporters beaming up yet? 
__label__KIRK Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the Klingons have been sighted in this sector. While we're negotiating down there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here. 
__label__KIRK Yes, quite all right. I'd like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs, please. Have you got that? 
__label__KIRK Now. as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M planets,  CHEKOV: Yes, sir. 
__label__KIRK You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks. Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you. We've come a long way in five thousand years. 
__label__KIRK To whom you sold the Starfleet Space Academy. Harry. 
__label__KIRK I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel. Mister Vanderberg, we'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries and tunnels. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Captain's log, Star date 1313.8. Add to official losses, Doctor Elizabeth Dehner. Be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask for what happened to him. 
__label__KIRK Just testing. Be in touch with you later. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Doctor McCoy. I'm recording you this message, Bones, so there will be no misunderstanding. I'm sorry to have to make it an order. You're not to disturb Captain Pike with any questions. Simply take good care of him. Follow Spock's instructions to the letter. Kirk out. (flash, flash) 
__label__KIRK Put it on audio. 
__label__KIRK Do you have a counterproposal? 
__label__KIRK Steady as she goes.  
__label__KIRK No, Mister Spock. One thing for certain. Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety. 
__label__KIRK You in a hurry, Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Yes, we can. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Can you compensate for the loss? 
__label__KIRK Bones, you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship. That small patient in there needs you. 
__label__KIRK Move aside, Bones. 
__label__KIRK What do you want? 
__label__KIRK Good. Contact me when you can. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK What's the law in these cases? 
__label__KIRK I don't think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere, however a planet is evolving. 
__label__KIRK Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock . 
__label__KIRK We're sick, and we're getting sicker. 
__label__KIRK Was the Huron attacked? 
__label__KIRK I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK It's too late for threats. You let me contact the ship. How long do you think it will it be before a search party arrives? 
__label__KIRK Stand by. Do you read any Romulans? 
__label__KIRK Organia's description, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty. 
__label__KIRK Committed to Tantalus colony when?
__label__KIRK Put it on the screen. 
__label__KIRK We'll get you, Spock. It won't be long. 
__label__KIRK Tyree? 
__label__KIRK Can't I get it through your stupid head? I can't just kill them!
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius.
__label__KIRK Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive? 
__label__KIRK You sold tribbles on a Klingon planet? 
__label__KIRK As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry. It's up to you.
__label__KIRK Could an army of Spocks impose peace and Phylosian philosophy on any other beings in defiance of the IDIC concept? 
__label__KIRK You realise that within forty five minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere? 
__label__KIRK Keep those screens up. Worry about us when the ship is safe. 
__label__KIRK Ready phasers. 
__label__KIRK Override. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us. 
__label__KIRK No identification of self or mission. No interference with the social development of said planet. 
__label__KIRK Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. 
__label__KIRK I'm sure you won't mind if I ignore your advice. 
__label__KIRK Weapons department, maintain battle stations.
__label__KIRK I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere. Not too much deck tennis, no frantic dancing, and no responsibility. Why me? I look around that Bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next move. And Bones, what if I'm wrong? 
__label__KIRK That's true. 
__label__KIRK We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it. 
__label__KIRK You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture. 
__label__KIRK It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock suggested it. 
__label__KIRK You were actually enjoying my predicament back there. At times, you seem quite human. 
__label__KIRK There are other ways. You'll discover them. You must move to the surface, you understand. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, I mean Billy. Come along. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor two. 
__label__KIRK Spock  (They all fall over) 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, the Fabrini descendants are scheduled to debark on their promised planet in approximately three hundred and ninety days.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, let's see what the scanners have come up with on the cloud's composition. 
__label__KIRK We're going to try. 
__label__KIRK Any reply?
__label__KIRK Very well. Continue investigations. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar occurrences. You'll find the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years ago from exactly the same impossible causes. 
__label__KIRK Are your faces alike? Can you tell from them which of you is good and which of you is evil? 
__label__KIRK That's impossible. We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon. I tried to beam down, something happened, and you were beamed aboard from Gideon. 
__label__KIRK He's an exact duplicate? 
__label__KIRK You're talking nonsense. 
__label__KIRK Very well. I order you to release crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura immediately. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Professor Gill, can you hear me? You've got to speak. You've got to speak. This is our last chance. Gill?
__label__KIRK Yes, I think we could say that. Two to beam up, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Welcome aboard, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Grab your medical kit and come down here on the double. I've got a patient for you. 
__label__KIRK It'd be a shame if that happened. 
__label__KIRK Goodbye. Energise.
__label__KIRK Get back up here. 
__label__KIRK Rojan, I'm going to sickbay. My first officer was taken ill. 
__label__KIRK It's too late for that, Jamie, but I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. You know Doctor Leighton, don't you? Would you say he's given to fantasy? 
__label__KIRK What was that? 
__label__KIRK All right. All right. 
__label__KIRK Your life here must be almost perfect, if you haven't wanted to leave. 
__label__KIRK Of course.
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me. 
__label__KIRK Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated. 
__label__KIRK Can you pinpoint the source? 
__label__KIRK Once I get my hands on a communicator, I can have Scotty beam us all aboard the Enterprise. Ready now. 
__label__KIRK You did fire at it, didn't you? 
__label__KIRK I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining. 
__label__KIRK Uh, why do you ask? 
__label__KIRK Put him on the speaker. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Joy to you. 
__label__KIRK You know us? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Sargon borrowed my body. I was floating in time and space. 
__label__KIRK And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way? 
__label__KIRK Are there men on this planet? 
__label__KIRK I'm all right. Scotty, what are you doing here? 
__label__KIRK Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody. 
__label__KIRK No. That'd start the final battle. I believe her. Prepare the transporter. We'll wait for your signal. 
__label__KIRK Have no fear. Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, ETA the Benecia Colony. 
__label__KIRK What? What do you base that on? 
__label__KIRK No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four. Try. 
__label__KIRK I am forced to contest that, Commodore. I want to see more.
__label__KIRK Not even Sarian brandy? 
__label__KIRK (to Security) Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't fire unless he's armed. Go.
__label__KIRK Both those men are well aware of landing party procedure. They should've checked in with us by now. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive. 
__label__KIRK Analysis of disputed area? 
__label__KIRK That's quite a difference. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary. Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at me. Look at me. Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally armed. Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating? Even, Spock, even race hatred? 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, you are responsible for the situation we are in.
__label__KIRK Put him on. 
__label__KIRK Let's see what you have. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty? 
__label__KIRK That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun. Why? 
__label__KIRK Is there nothing you can do? 
__label__KIRK I'm already on maximum.
__label__KIRK But with the mind of a child. Bones, what is it? 
__label__KIRK We'll bombard the unpopulated pressure areas with phaser beams and change the epicentre of the quake so it won't endanger your people or your city. 
__label__KIRK And this cave a trap. 
__label__KIRK Make a challenge. Warn that ship off. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries. 
__label__KIRK Yes. He had been at the Academy for an unusually long time as an instructor. As a result, he was late in being assigned to a starship. The delay, he felt, looked bad on his record. My action, he believed, made things worse. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the command crew, to leave the ship. I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room. 
__label__KIRK Another plant? 
__label__KIRK What about memory? Tell me about Sam. 
__label__KIRK Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it. 
__label__KIRK You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him. 
__label__KIRK And what have you to say now? 
__label__KIRK Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Lieutenant?
__label__KIRK Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide? 
__label__KIRK Beam me aboard. 
__label__KIRK We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command. 
__label__KIRK What did you have in mind? 
__label__KIRK All they have is a mystery and no answers. Mister Sulu, signal the Transporter Chief. Four to beam up. 
__label__KIRK Really, M'Ress, you're going to have to be a little more clever than that. 
__label__KIRK Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun. 
__label__KIRK Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see her? 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK I don't see anything. I can't understand it. 
__label__KIRK You're mad. 
__label__KIRK Of some kind. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, beam us up fast. 
__label__KIRK Bones, increase the dosage. 
__label__KIRK Careful. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Come with me, please. 
__label__KIRK At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you. 
__label__KIRK By whom? 
__label__KIRK There's no serum! There are no miracles! There's no immortality here! All this is for nothing! 
__label__KIRK You're black on one side and white on the other. 
__label__KIRK Check it out, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Good work, Mister Scott. That deflector shield went up just in time.
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK What exactly were you doing? 
__label__KIRK Find him. Kirk out. Mister Spock, we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride. 
__label__KIRK Deflector shields on. 
__label__KIRK Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship because we desire it. 
__label__KIRK You have my sworn deposition.  STONE: Then, Captain, I must presume you've committed willful perjury.
__label__KIRK I'm not sure, but I think  (A screen comes to life with a face on it) 
__label__KIRK Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here. Only answering your charges against me will force me back. 
__label__KIRK We'll take you to a place to hide. 
__label__KIRK I had a whole universe to myself after the Defiant was thrown out. There was absolutely no one else in it. I must say I prefer a crowded universe much better. How did you two get along without me? 
__label__KIRK No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a place to retreat to. What I want to do now is scout them out, find their weaknesses and attack. 
__label__KIRK (dazed and confused) Where am I? What place is this? What are these? (phaser and communicator) I feel should know. They're familiar and yet unfamiliar. How did I get here? Who am I? Try to remember. 
__label__KIRK I was requesting your analysis, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Bridge to transporter room. Their vessel has been hit by an asteroid. It's gone. Did you get the crew off? 
__label__KIRK Riley, get back to the Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span. 
__label__KIRK They must apply to everyone or they mean nothing! Do you understand? 
__label__KIRK Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm. 
__label__KIRK We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld. 
__label__KIRK Spock knows. 
__label__KIRK Anything on communications, Lieutenant Uhura? 
__label__KIRK Explain the computer components. 
__label__KIRK What am I doing here? A mugato bite! I remember. I told him to take me to Tyree's camp. I knew you'd find a kahn-ut-tu to cure me. The kahn-ut-tu is the local witch people here. They've studied (Nona gets up and stands in front of him) They've studied the roots and the herbs.
__label__KIRK Can you fix it again? 
__label__KIRK No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate. 
__label__KIRK Explain, Spock. One of a kind? 
__label__KIRK Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours. 
__label__KIRK Thanks, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara? 
__label__KIRK It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later. 
__label__KIRK This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial. We have used these filter masks frequently on  PLASUS [on monitor]: Do you really expect me to believe that that mask can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, stop all engines. 
__label__KIRK Twenty? I can't run a starship with twenty crew. 
__label__KIRK It's not making any threatening moves, Spock.
__label__KIRK Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton. 
__label__KIRK I've heard it was similar.
__label__KIRK I want you to surrender. 
__label__KIRK What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I thought I had until dawn. 
__label__KIRK I'm in command, Bones. It makes it my fault. How do you fight a thing like that? 
__label__KIRK Phasers, stand by. 
__label__KIRK Oh, dear. If you'll forgive me, our communications officer  LINCOLN: I would be delighted to have her as guide. 
__label__KIRK What do you mean, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK We haven't heard much from you about Omicron Ceti Three, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Melakon? 
__label__KIRK That's where we're going. 
__label__KIRK Then why'd you do it? 
__label__KIRK You've seen them. Do they have bodies? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK What about the shuttlecraft? 
__label__KIRK What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid. 
__label__KIRK Name, Khan, as we know him today. (Spock changes the picture)
__label__KIRK Thank you. Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Is everyone safe? 
__label__KIRK Who will you start with, my crew? Are we your next targets? 
__label__KIRK What is? 
__label__KIRK Life sciences.
__label__KIRK There's no way to tell from here. The mechanical exploded. We can't reach the roof from the outside. We'll have to try to get to him from the interior. 
__label__KIRK Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer. 
__label__KIRK Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four. 
__label__KIRK Work on it. We've got to contact the ship. Mea, I want you to give me a complete layout of this building complex. How do I get to the War Room? 
__label__KIRK I wasn't sure before, but I am now. This is the source of your power, isn't it. The transmuter. 
__label__KIRK Why, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Transported without incident. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Correct it. 
__label__KIRK And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve. 
__label__KIRK Stay with the controls. Keep our forward shields to him. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. We've been there. 
__label__KIRK That we have immobilized your ship worse than you have immobilized ours. 
__label__KIRK Go. 
__label__KIRK I admire your ethics and hope to prove ours. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically. 
__label__KIRK And I too am pleased, beloved. 
__label__KIRK Being your slave, what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend, nor services to do, till you  MCCOY: Stop it! Don't do this to him, Parmen! 
__label__KIRK He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister O'Neil. 
__label__KIRK Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life? 
__label__KIRK Let's get the hell out of here.  
__label__KIRK Lucky for us they don't work. 
__label__KIRK No, no, no. All right, all right, all right. We don't want any trouble. 
__label__KIRK No, please come in, Mister Winston. 
__label__KIRK Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship.
__label__KIRK Any life readings? 
__label__KIRK Alert status. 
__label__KIRK A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it. 
__label__KIRK I see. So, we go back to Troyius. 
__label__KIRK I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me. 
__label__KIRK Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip. Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift. We've got to stop them. We outnumber them. Their only hold on us is the paralysis field. 
__label__KIRK What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?
__label__KIRK Benecia Colony. 
__label__KIRK Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.
__label__KIRK Bones, that's it. Aurora, changing colour. 
__label__KIRK How can he die? Can I survive without him? 
__label__KIRK We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour. We must regain control of the ship by then. 
__label__KIRK Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I believe. 
__label__KIRK I'll take the conn, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Data on question submitted to personnel files. 
__label__KIRK She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK You got Krako on ice? 
__label__KIRK And transport Mister Spock and myself immediately. 
__label__KIRK Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation  KOR: Or our Empire! 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health that we'll begin decontamination procedures immediately upon locking into orbit. 
__label__KIRK I don't understand.
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, report. 
__label__KIRK Go to the engineering station. 
__label__KIRK What did the others die of? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come? 
__label__KIRK I can't kill them! I can't kill them! 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on full stun. 
__label__KIRK Ahead full. 
__label__KIRK Has Childress reported in yet? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. 
__label__KIRK Receiving transmissions from Talos Four? Then the images we've been seeing are SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.
__label__KIRK Yes. I wanted to be certain there was no error. Formula is correct. Don't be concerned. It is an excellent body. There. You see? I feel better already. 
__label__KIRK It's no secret. We were assigned to the same ship some years later. I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should've been closed. Another five minutes, it could have blown up the ship. 
__label__KIRK Data on witnesses. 
__label__KIRK Well, we'd better get some facts. Rig for towing. 
__label__KIRK Then, what happened? 
__label__KIRK What happened?
__label__KIRK You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been pretending too long. (grabs her) Stop pretending. Let's stop pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice.
__label__KIRK Spock. How long? 
__label__KIRK Sound Red Alert. Man battle stations. Stand by main phasers. 
__label__KIRK The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit. 'It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.'  SPOCK: It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today. 
__label__KIRK You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition. 
__label__KIRK I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Elaan. 
__label__KIRK Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Three, two, one. Accelerate. 
__label__KIRK Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe that  KOMACK [on monitor]: You will proceed to Altair Six as ordered. You have your orders. Starfleet out. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Megavoltage. Touch the wrong line, and you're dead.
__label__KIRK Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle. 
__label__KIRK What happened to him? 
__label__KIRK It does now. 
__label__KIRK Name it. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll contact. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Progress report, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any history of psychosomatic illness? 
__label__KIRK There's some kind of interference on all channels. We're going to have to get out of this village on our own. 
__label__KIRK No, wait! There's a better way. Does not your sacred book promise that good is stronger than evil? 
__label__KIRK Where's Mister Spock with that computer log extract? 
__label__KIRK Please. Outside. 
__label__KIRK They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a central projector. 
__label__KIRK I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Secure from general quarters. Lieutenant, open the hailing frequency. If they wish to surrender  (A very big flare makes everyone shield their eyes.) 
__label__KIRK Radiation levels? 
__label__KIRK I don't want to say goodbye. 
__label__KIRK Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. To our good friends of Yonada. 
__label__KIRK You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature?
__label__KIRK Not when one of my men is dead because of it and two others turned into mindless  KOROB: NO, not mindless. These two are merely controlled, Captain Kirk.
__label__KIRK Try to contact the ship. 
__label__KIRK I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your posts. Go to your posts. 
__label__KIRK Specific origin? 
__label__KIRK I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just happened  MCCOY: I'm afraid I'll have to make it later today, Captain. I have too many tests to process right now. 
__label__KIRK I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted. 
__label__KIRK How old are you? How old are you? 
__label__KIRK We'll try not to interfere with your work. 
__label__KIRK One of us will have to stay. 
__label__KIRK That's better, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK These two are alive. Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know who I am? What's happened to you? 
__label__KIRK The Enterprise is dead in space, stopped cold during her pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid, facing the Captain of the alien ship. Weaponless, I face the creature the Metrons called a Gorn. Large, reptilian. Like most humans, I seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles. I must fight to remember that this is an intelligent, highly advanced individual, the Captain of a starship, like myself, undoubtedly a dangerously clever opponent. 
__label__KIRK No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time. 
__label__KIRK You! 
__label__KIRK Of the planet Cheron, no doubt. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit, and I can completely cure this. (his arm)
__label__KIRK It wasn't me! 
__label__KIRK There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe with the established facts. How do you explain that.
__label__KIRK I didn't think that for a moment. What else? 
__label__KIRK Spock! If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow take Bones back a day in time, then  SPOCK: Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish  KIRK: Guardian. Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes? 
__label__KIRK Maintain. 
__label__KIRK All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage report, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory. 
__label__KIRK Bridge.
__label__KIRK Screen on. 
__label__KIRK Have you located the malfunction, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK To exercise the better part of valour. 
__label__KIRK Phasers, fire. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Let's see it. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know.
__label__KIRK I see. Mister Spock. Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved. Mister Scott, ready to beam up. 
__label__KIRK It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the computer? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings. Its destination is Marcos. If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus. 
__label__KIRK All right, I'll listen. What are you telling? 
__label__KIRK Why did you not speak until now? 
__label__KIRK Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order! 
__label__KIRK We're beaming over. Lock in on our signal. 
__label__KIRK Harry, do you have any of the crystals left? 
__label__KIRK Spock, can you rig a low-frequency shield like the one on the alien ship, on our navigation console? 
__label__KIRK She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him. 
__label__KIRK (watching Pike on monitor) He keeps blinking no. No to what?
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal. 
__label__KIRK I will destroy it. 
__label__KIRK I don't buy that, Bones. Guard! 
__label__KIRK What is it, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Arex? 
__label__KIRK All the comforts of home indeed, Mister Cochrane. Where'd you get the antiques? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you with them to Triacus. So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time. That would make them very unhappy and miss you. I'm sure that you would miss them, too. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. I don't know. All right, everybody. Back to your posts. Let's get out of here.
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we all. Even your friends. You may go. 
__label__KIRK Launch shuttlecraft. 
__label__KIRK Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course.
__label__KIRK Let's do that. 
__label__KIRK Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that. 
__label__KIRK Because she approved of you? 
__label__KIRK Against the wall! 
__label__KIRK There are over four hundred guys there. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK Bones. Let's take a look at the library. We have a lot to learn. 
__label__KIRK You're saying he couldn't have done it? 
__label__KIRK Oh, Mister Berkeley, you might refamiliarise yourself with the manual on penal colony procedures.
__label__KIRK (reading a clipboard) The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo Command Headquarters. Well, that takes care of the phasers. 
__label__KIRK Maybe I'll step outside, too. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's possible. There's also the possibility of underground water. 
__label__KIRK Goodbye, Areel. Better luck next time. 
__label__KIRK Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son. 
__label__KIRK What's the composition of the antitoxin, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Auxiliary control, this is the captain. Auxiliary control, what's going on down there? 
__label__KIRK And it becomes Nancy for you. 
__label__KIRK If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure the mutation wasn't somehow accomplished naturally? 
__label__KIRK It'll hurt seeing him like that. 
__label__KIRK Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that? 
__label__KIRK Difficult. 
__label__KIRK Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Are you out of your mind? You were told to report to me at once. 
__label__KIRK Run that message through the universal translator, Lieutenant Uhura. Perhaps it can tell us what language she is speaking in. 
__label__KIRK Nothing wrong and nothing works. 
__label__KIRK Agreed. Take us into orbit, Lieutenant Arex. 
__label__KIRK Not the most enchanting place I've ever been to. 
__label__KIRK I've never felt like this before either. 
__label__KIRK They're not responding. 
__label__KIRK You and Scotty have Spock ready.
__label__KIRK Is that Memory Alpha? 
__label__KIRK Put Security on it.
__label__KIRK Look, Let's not talk shop. 
__label__KIRK Another dream that failed. There's nothing sadder. It took these people a year to make the trip from Earth. They came all that way and died. 
__label__KIRK What happened to your ship? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise. Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Engine room from Bridge.
__label__KIRK Why is it forbidden? 
__label__KIRK How soon will that be ready? 
__label__KIRK Captain Ronald Tracey, as per Starfleet Command, regulation seven, paragraph four  TRACEY: I must now consider myself under arrest, unless in the presence of the most senior fellow officers presently available, I give satisfactory answer to those charges which you now bring. Et cetera, et cetera. Those were the first words duty required you to say to me, and you said them. You're covered. Now, suppose we go on to the next subject. 
__label__KIRK I'm very glad to see you. 
__label__KIRK That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it? Tell me about that. 
__label__KIRK And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here? 
__label__KIRK Phasers, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK We're not going to hurt you. Is this your home? Do you live here?
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. I was just thinking. 
__label__KIRK I agree. 
__label__KIRK No one rules the galaxy. Men and machines co-exist, each helping the other. 
__label__KIRK All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference. Mister Leslie? 
__label__KIRK Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to good use. Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this. Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any. 
__label__KIRK You could. A while ago it was child's play.
__label__KIRK Don't worry about it. We're happy without it. 
__label__KIRK I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her. 
__label__KIRK That could be what destroyed him. 
__label__KIRK Proceed immediately to maximum orbit. 
__label__KIRK I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my orders. 
__label__KIRK Well, that ought to do it. Have Sulu lock all phaser banks onto the structure. Fire on my order only. Cut it fine.
__label__KIRK The year 2030. 
__label__KIRK We'll ride her through, Bones. What else can we do? 
__label__KIRK Yeah. 
__label__KIRK This is the vaccine? 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, you and the security team will remain here at the entrance. We'll be in constant contact with you. 
__label__KIRK I'll talk to him, Bones. It's all I can do. 
__label__KIRK So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, I'm glad you've come. 
__label__KIRK All right. All right. In the heart. In the head. I won't stay dead. Next time I'll do the same to you. I'll kill you. And it goes on, the good old game of war, pawn against pawn! Stopping the bad guys.
__label__KIRK What, Scott? 
__label__KIRK No one can see. Put your phaser on stun. 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, if you had those two phasers and those communicators all this time, why didn't you use them to escape? 
__label__KIRK There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard. 
__label__KIRK What source? 
__label__KIRK I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie. 
__label__KIRK You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Steady as she goes, Mister Hanson. 
__label__KIRK But you say there's nothing to worry about? 
__label__KIRK The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him. 
__label__KIRK I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon. 
__label__KIRK You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris? 
__label__KIRK Promised? Parmen? He'd let us beam up to the Enterprise, and plunge the ship back into the atmosphere. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine. Get to work. 
__label__KIRK An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.
__label__KIRK Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected? 
__label__KIRK How did we get here? 
__label__KIRK Sit down, Mister. 
__label__KIRK But why would Kukulkan want to destroy us? 
__label__KIRK With a communicator, we might be able to find out. This fellow is keeping us from our property. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, lay in a course for Cepheus. 
__label__KIRK Keep scanning. 
__label__KIRK A little dizzy. Otherwise normal. 
__label__KIRK God of war, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Can half a man live? 
__label__KIRK All right. Let's go find out what it is. Set your phasers on force three, to kill. We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill. 
__label__KIRK You? What happened before you came here? Try to remember. It's important. 
__label__KIRK I have no objections, sir. 
__label__KIRK Bones, tell the professor what the autopsy revealed. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK Do you have any ideas, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Try to raise it, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Phaser banks. Report.
__label__KIRK Professor Crater! Professor Crater! 
__label__KIRK It might tell us something. 
__label__KIRK Orion's neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair regarding the Coridan planets and the Babel Conference of stardate 3850.3. Yesterday, a Federation freighter was attacked in this quadrant, its cargo hijacked. As the first alien ship encountered, we require you to submit to search, as per Babel Resolution A12. Reply. 
__label__KIRK Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in!
__label__KIRK My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you would find it satisfactory. 
__label__KIRK The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar. Our laws. And the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will always remain yours. This differs us from the Klingons. Their empire is made up of conquered worlds. They take what they want by arms and force. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, how much time is there? 
__label__KIRK Now get back to Sickbay. Go on. 
__label__KIRK Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I know what I saw him do in the gymnasium. 
__label__KIRK You have shut down life-support systems and endangered members of my crew. Restore those systems first. 
__label__KIRK Plans to McKinley Rocket Base.
__label__KIRK Where's Apollo? 
__label__KIRK Let's see if it'll give way. Ahead half speed.
__label__KIRK Identification. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Romaine. 
__label__KIRK That's a pretty close approximation. 
__label__KIRK I don't think another test is necessary. 
__label__KIRK That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play. 
__label__KIRK How'd this beast get aboard my ship? 
__label__KIRK You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack. 
__label__KIRK Uh oh. 
__label__KIRK Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking! 
__label__KIRK Now, that could be a bit of a problem. If they were inside, where they couldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here. 
__label__KIRK They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them to survive. 
__label__KIRK It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few questions. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Argh! (machine to maximum) Kirk to Enterprise. Argh!
__label__KIRK Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent. 
__label__KIRK Delay that order, Mister Sulu! 
__label__KIRK Bones, what about it? 
__label__KIRK Of course. Spock. 
__label__KIRK Get Cyrano Jones up here. 
__label__KIRK In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised? 
__label__KIRK Hard to port, Sulu. Let's face them head on. 
__label__KIRK Go to Red Alert. Notify Mister Lurry. We'll be right up. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Science Officer. Come to one eight one mark seven. 
__label__KIRK Magnification eight. What is that? 
__label__KIRK Would be? You mean you think they're fakes? 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, please. We have work to do. 
__label__KIRK It looks like ancient Earth, Spock. Sixteenth or seventeenth century, I'd guess. 
__label__KIRK Sam. It is my brother. Was my brother. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, co-operate completely with Lieutenant Tracy. Maybe we'll clear this thing up. 
__label__KIRK I wish to talk to those in charge. 
__label__KIRK Hard about. 
__label__KIRK The price of your survival is too high. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved. 
__label__KIRK Anything missing? 
__label__KIRK What were their symptoms?
__label__KIRK Cool off. 
__label__KIRK I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me. 
__label__KIRK That's twice you've referred to us as my children. 
__label__KIRK I do. I've met some interesting personalities myself. Have you seen any of the others while I've been gone?
__label__KIRK What does it mean, we are Nomad? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK So did they. Mister Chekov, take over.
__label__KIRK You must tell us. 
__label__KIRK This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones. We seem to be in the middle of a creeping paralysis. Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise before we started losing power. 
__label__KIRK We'll need somebody in the pod for readings. 
__label__KIRK I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock. I must know what to do. 
__label__KIRK Full ahead. All decks, condition red. 
__label__KIRK Yes. A slip of the tongue. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Security. 
__label__KIRK Is Kor's office down there? 
__label__KIRK Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock. It's an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient, does too much work for you. 
__label__KIRK Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mister Advisor. 
__label__KIRK Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows. 
__label__KIRK If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers  CLAUDIUS: you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire, and violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies. I believe you all swear you'll die before you'd violate that directive. Am I right? 
__label__KIRK Yes, sir, the Enterprise. I'm the captain. (Kirk and Garth shake hands) Can I help? 
__label__KIRK A more useful comment, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Get out of my way, Salish. 
__label__KIRK Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong? 
__label__KIRK Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while. Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed? 
__label__KIRK When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation. (waves away a buzz) But there is an insect life. 
__label__KIRK My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties. 
__label__KIRK Bones, you all right? 
__label__KIRK It strikes me very well. But you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane. Why not up the stakes? 
__label__KIRK But I can, Professor. 
__label__KIRK You think of us as being small creatures like this one. Are we really that inferior to you? 
__label__KIRK What if we are? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK I'm on my way. 
__label__KIRK All right. The temple is his power source. Let's bring him back to it. Get to cover. Mister Spock, fire those phasers. 
__label__KIRK If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company. 
__label__KIRK To say the least. 
__label__KIRK Any indication of Keniclius or Spock? 
__label__KIRK We can't search this whole planet on foot. 
__label__KIRK Tell me about it. 
__label__KIRK You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there  COMMANDER: Captain, if a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation, what would a starbase commander do?
__label__KIRK Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early.
__label__KIRK Who don't have the psychokinetic ability. 
__label__KIRK There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available? 
__label__KIRK Where have you been? What happened?
__label__KIRK But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent, runaways? 
__label__KIRK Hazards? 
__label__KIRK He's probably beaming down with the crystals right now. I'm going after him. You organise a security detail. Follow me as soon as you can. 
__label__KIRK It killed four crewmen. Now Crater.
__label__KIRK Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK No, it doesn't. What do you want us to do with you? 
__label__KIRK Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat? 
__label__KIRK You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me. 
__label__KIRK We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe. 
__label__KIRK Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull. Put a team on that warp drive. Get it working. 
__label__KIRK That girl. 
__label__KIRK And strong personal feelings, he obeyed the Prime Directive. His temporary blackout of the city below resulted in no interference with the society and yet saved the lives of myself and the landing party. 
__label__KIRK That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it? 
__label__KIRK Which is? 
__label__KIRK (shaking) Contact ship. Took full poison. Fangs. 
__label__KIRK No. Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my orders. Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out. Mister Atoz, where are you? 
__label__KIRK Professor Crater. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the viewscreen. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard? 
__label__KIRK Then how can you stand  MEA: Don't you see? If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons. We would have to do the same to defend ourselves. More than people would die then. A whole civilisation would be destroyed. Surely you can see that ours is a better way. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy? All right, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Full strength? 
__label__KIRK Spock?
__label__KIRK He's also half human.
__label__KIRK Spock, the computer! Destroy it! 
__label__KIRK No, Colonel. I know it's no game. 
__label__KIRK What have you learned about the aliens? 
__label__KIRK How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.
__label__KIRK Thank you. Now what have you done with the medicine? 
__label__KIRK If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK We've come in friendship. 
__label__KIRK Keep checking. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to crew. Is anyone aboard? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to auxiliary control. Bridge to auxiliary control. 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here? 
__label__KIRK Is he, Bones? 
__label__KIRK I know you can hear me, so don't cut me off. We have Mara, your wife. We talk truce now, or she dies. Reply. 
__label__KIRK Five hundred kilos and only one metre long? 
__label__KIRK Forgive my curiosity, Mister Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey. 
__label__KIRK Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone. It's my fault Mitchell got as far as he did. Did you see their direction? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Spock, do you see any hope that these Yangs can be reasoned with?
__label__KIRK But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end. 
__label__KIRK Washburn, try the 2G6 circuit. 
__label__KIRK Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me what this is all about, mister? 
__label__KIRK Harry, I think they have something else in mind. 
__label__KIRK Don't misunderstand my next question. Mister Spock, why aren't you dead? 
__label__KIRK You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie? 
__label__KIRK I have a tongue. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Are you getting a reading on them? 
__label__KIRK That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring? 
__label__KIRK The lower levels. The Engineering deck.
__label__KIRK What exactly is it? 
__label__KIRK Spock, you've got something? 
__label__KIRK They've come back. They were gone for a while, but they've come back, and I see faces, too. Very dim. I feel I should know know them. I feel my place is with them, not here. I don't deserve this happiness. 
__label__KIRK You're a spy, surgically altered to pass as an Andorian. Planted in the ambassador's party to use terror and murder to disrupt us and prepare for this attack. 
__label__KIRK If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the only thing that might convince her. 
__label__KIRK Maintain. (he answers the intercom) Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Landru, answer the question. 
__label__KIRK If you have Spock's mind, you'll know the Vulcan symbol called the IDIC. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK How is she? 
__label__KIRK Your, your terms are unfair. 
__label__KIRK Is there any cure? 
__label__KIRK Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones, give them something to keep them out for a while. (into communicator) Spock. Spock. Come on, Spock. Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock. 
__label__KIRK He thrives on love, worship, attention. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, cut in emergency manual monitor. I want the override broken. 
__label__KIRK There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children.
__label__KIRK Fire photon torpedoes. 
__label__KIRK Do you have a name? 
__label__KIRK I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools. You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis. 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK Cut power. 
__label__KIRK Rayna. 
__label__KIRK Speculation? 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control. 
__label__KIRK We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now.
__label__KIRK Recommendations? 
__label__KIRK That planet it is a myth. 
__label__KIRK All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to stimulate the senses. 
__label__KIRK All right. Put them on. 
__label__KIRK Fantastic. 20 times as hard as diamond. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu. Get below. Take command of Engineering and auxiliary control. 
__label__KIRK We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. 
__label__KIRK Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship. And nothing is more important than my ship. 
__label__KIRK I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it.
__label__KIRK Spock, if you can't handle it, I'm going to have to trust him. 
__label__KIRK Constant surveillance, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Well, if I am a friend and you don't tell him, do you really want to risk that? 
__label__KIRK Spock? Acknowledge. 
__label__KIRK You're returning with us? 
__label__KIRK Confirm Chekov's co-ordinates for the missile's point of origin. 
__label__KIRK Mister Lincoln! 
__label__KIRK Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it. 
__label__KIRK That's what this whole masquerade was about. To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook. 
__label__KIRK I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are strange to me. 
__label__KIRK Energise.
__label__KIRK Don't lose contact with each other like your ancestors. 
__label__KIRK Bones, you can't stop now. 
__label__KIRK What have you done with my men? 
__label__KIRK Evidently not so simple. 
__label__KIRK If you really believed that, Bones, you wouldn't still be a doctor after twenty five years. 
__label__KIRK Excellent, Scotty. Stand by to beam up landing party. Let's go and see how the others are doing. Marplon can finish up here.
__label__KIRK Landru is dead. You are a machine. A question has been put to you. Answer it. 
__label__KIRK Faked. All this happened several days ago. (to a man in a yellow shirt) Lang, over there. Look for survivors. Kelowitz, (blue shirt)
__label__KIRK Now wait, wait. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Analysis, Science Officer? 
__label__KIRK She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the Fuhrer. 
__label__KIRK Report, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Rayna, come with me. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman Barrows. 
__label__KIRK Beam up to the ship and start processing. 
__label__KIRK We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
__label__KIRK I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy. 
__label__KIRK Spock, I want all hands at their stations. We're going to run a complete systems check from bow to stern and get to the bottom of this.
__label__KIRK No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough examination, and you're ill. In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay, you're going to die. 
__label__KIRK I'd forgotten. 
__label__KIRK Total reply if attacked. So that's the answer. Klingons. 
__label__KIRK We're busy. (quietly) Look after the girl. 
__label__KIRK Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log. 
__label__KIRK You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman. 
__label__KIRK All right, Ensign. You can go. Thank you very much. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? 
__label__KIRK Where've they been during the past few minutes? 
__label__KIRK All personnel, away from helm area. Go to the far bulkhead. 
__label__KIRK Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere.
__label__KIRK How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't kill me, of course? 
__label__KIRK Spock, you did it! The cloud is leaving. 
__label__KIRK No, Miramanee, there's no one else in my mind or my heart. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, explanation. 
__label__KIRK Energise! 
__label__KIRK Yes, the irritation would be gone. 
__label__KIRK Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away. 
__label__KIRK You must put back what you have taken. 
__label__KIRK Are you responsible for bringing us here? Don't be afraid. Bones, what's wrong with her? 
__label__KIRK Aiming at what, Mister Sulu? So far all source studies have shown the waves come from an area as large as one sixth the planet's surface.
__label__KIRK Cartographic Sections, implement standard orders. 
__label__KIRK Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite consignment. 
__label__KIRK The fool. 
__label__KIRK Good luck. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK What word from the sensor section? 
__label__KIRK There's a cave in there. Probably the only shelter around here. 
__label__KIRK Priority One distress call, and it's just absolutely peaceful.
__label__KIRK Could seismic stress have accounted for it? 
__label__KIRK No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Don't they ever rest? 
__label__KIRK I think we can expect others, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Who else has seen this? 
__label__KIRK There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to work? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon the performance of a single crewman, and the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally  MARLA: Not personally, Captain. Professionally. My profession is historian, and when I find a specimen from the past alive, I'm in the sheer delight of examining his mind. 
__label__KIRK I know, but really  MCCOY: And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will. And, brother, have they got a lot of will. 
__label__KIRK Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity. 
__label__KIRK Bridge here. Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK I'd like to talk to you. 
__label__KIRK Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders. 
__label__KIRK But we're unhappy here. 
__label__KIRK Can you take us to their village while it's still dark? 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK You've what? 
__label__KIRK Spock! 
__label__KIRK Am I not now a prisoner of the Kohms as you are? 
__label__KIRK That's Ron Tracey. Ron. 
__label__KIRK Helmsmen, take us out of here. (Dehner gets hit by an electric charge, then Mitchell) Helmsmen! (Kirk takes controls) Lateral power!
__label__KIRK You came to my ship! 
__label__KIRK Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle stations. I hope we won't need your services, Bones. 
__label__KIRK There's only one thing I want to say to you, Commodore. Get my ship out of there. 
__label__KIRK We haven't enough phasers for you. 
__label__KIRK I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our greatest warrior. I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet.
__label__KIRK As soon as our course stabilizes, give me a reading. 
__label__KIRK Not completely. This is a parallel universe? 
__label__KIRK It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change the course of it, destroy it. 
__label__KIRK Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.
__label__KIRK Yes. He's the leader of our friends. 
__label__KIRK Oh, thank you, we must return to the ship. 
__label__KIRK Then there has to be some sort of signalling device here. 
__label__KIRK You can't. 
__label__KIRK Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage. 
__label__KIRK Shear away, Mister Bailey.
__label__KIRK I haven't decided. 
__label__KIRK Go on. 
__label__KIRK It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature must still be around. 
__label__KIRK Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to blast it out of space. 
__label__KIRK Let me see her. 
__label__KIRK Do you remember anything else? 
__label__KIRK As you wish, Ambassador. Mister Spock, we'll leave orbit in two hours. Would you care to beam down and visit your parents? 
__label__KIRK Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open. 
__label__KIRK I'm not joking. 
__label__KIRK In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the Federation. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet. 
__label__KIRK He was young, and inexperienced. 
__label__KIRK We can help you aboard the ship. 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK If my guess is correct, they won't have to.
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. You have confirmation, Miss Uhura.
__label__KIRK Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us. 
__label__KIRK And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too. 
__label__KIRK What? What's in there? 
__label__KIRK Not for true gamesters. 
__label__KIRK Twenty seconds to what? That's what worries me. Lieutenant Uhura, place the ship on Yellow Alert. 
__label__KIRK A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't believe it. 
__label__KIRK You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're dangerous. (makes a run for it but Ruk grabs him and throws him around)
__label__KIRK Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, ship wide order. Use communicators instead of intercom. Issue phasers to all crew members. Spock, repeat. 
__label__KIRK What's the emergency? 
__label__KIRK Have you got anything that will help up here? I don't want anybody folding on the bridge at a critical moment. 
__label__KIRK Johnson? 
__label__KIRK Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the Academy. One of the finest men I ever knew. I could have killed that thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time. 
__label__KIRK When we first materialised. 
__label__KIRK Is something wrong? 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. 
__label__KIRK What about Landru? 
__label__KIRK What now? You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too? 
__label__KIRK No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature. 
__label__KIRK Nobody's asking for your permission. 
__label__KIRK Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten yourself killed. 
__label__KIRK The zenite gas. 
__label__KIRK Alexander. Stand behind me. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past.
__label__KIRK Nor it ours. 
__label__KIRK Anything on intelligent life forms?
__label__KIRK How does it work? Show us! We'll protect you. 
__label__KIRK Sorry, Em. We'll be needing you. Sord. 
__label__KIRK Range, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK The cutter beams. 
__label__KIRK Release Chekov. Confine him to quarters. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, you've just earned your pay for the week. Stand by. Fire phasers. 
__label__KIRK How many infusions, Bones? 
__label__KIRK We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience. You don't understand what it is to live. Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect. 
__label__KIRK I have very little time. 
__label__KIRK I agree completely. 
__label__KIRK Try taking one of those red pills you gave me last week. You'll sleep.
__label__KIRK Nevertheless, we must return home and I am open to suggestions. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Give me the phone. 
__label__KIRK Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet? 
__label__KIRK You wouldn't be standing here if I had. 
__label__KIRK By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present. Apparently what he had in mind.
__label__KIRK You've made your point. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him transferred down to the engineering decks. 
__label__KIRK I think we've been trying to, Spock. Humans have their faults, greed, envy, panicky fear. But in the centuries since the Salem witch trials we have learned. We try to understand and respect all life forms. 
__label__KIRK I must see the Fuhrer. It's urgent. 
__label__KIRK They were smart enough to invent these training devices. What a way to maintain control over a man. 
__label__KIRK That's impossible! 
__label__KIRK (laughs) Is there anything else? 
__label__KIRK There is an insect life. 
__label__KIRK Seal off B deck, sections 18Y through 23D. 
__label__KIRK And you also know that nothing is proven. 
__label__KIRK No. We come from a far place. We are men. 
__label__KIRK It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship. 
__label__KIRK All right, Doctor. If that's what you want.
__label__KIRK Cut him off.
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Time factor, Bones? Epidemic? 
__label__KIRK And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard.
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK To you? Not to both of you? 
__label__KIRK Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you. They know what you are. Even the children learn.
__label__KIRK Just one thing. There is a third member of our group. 
__label__KIRK Bring them aboard, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Sky machines? Slaves? What are you talking about? 
__label__KIRK Total control? 
__label__KIRK What have you got to trade? 
__label__KIRK No! Wait! 
__label__KIRK Carry on, Lieutenant. The Romulans were expecting us, Mister Spock. That wreck of Winston's ship was the bait to get a Romulan spy onboard. And what better spy than a Vendorian who can shape at will.
__label__KIRK And they keep McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Why not? 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Of course. 
__label__KIRK You're right. He's not one of us. 
__label__KIRK Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Something, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But I, I can't remember. 
__label__KIRK The Captain of a ship, no matter his rank, must follow the book. 
__label__KIRK Her death is unnecessary. Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the transporter room. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of.
__label__KIRK Digging a grave. 
__label__KIRK Maximum acceleration when I give the word.
__label__KIRK No problem yet. Maintain alert. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Man your post, Mister. If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid. 
__label__KIRK Take me to him. I wish to speak to him. 
__label__KIRK Ma'am. 
__label__KIRK Cory? 
__label__KIRK And get these tribbles off the bridge. 
__label__KIRK Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you might like to meet her. 
__label__KIRK The location of that planet? 
__label__KIRK All crew personnel report to Transporter rooms immediately.
__label__KIRK Let's find the others. I feel a need for human companionship. 
__label__KIRK You all right? 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel. Clearance plans now in effect. 
__label__KIRK We can take an educated guess. At the point we entered their solar system. 
__label__KIRK McCoy! He's in  (McCoy comes out and they greet each other enthusiastically. A truck is coming down the street as Edith starts to cross, not looking.) 
__label__KIRK I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of replicas? Which are you this time, real or not? 
__label__KIRK Interesting story, Scotty. I can't tell you now because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Peace  MCCOY: You're not! 
__label__KIRK Pleasure, madam. 
__label__KIRK Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to abandon search. Set course for Makus Three. 
__label__KIRK It will take too long to do a comprehensive scan. I want a landing party to at least beam down to the last known co-ordinates the other crew used. 
__label__KIRK Commander. I'm honoured. 
__label__KIRK All right, Lieutenant. Carry on. 
__label__KIRK Watch it! Watch it! 
__label__KIRK Transporter room, lock onto Sulu and O'Neil.
__label__KIRK Are you sure you're not imagining all this?
__label__KIRK I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them, I'll use them. 
__label__KIRK Why don't you step outside, Darnell. 
__label__KIRK Quite right, Spock. And that responsibility includes not losing the best science officer in Starfleet. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel. Mister Spock and I are transporting aboard. Mister Scott, you have the conn. 
__label__KIRK What are we waiting for? 
__label__KIRK You mean, all the people are dead? 
__label__KIRK Peter? 
__label__KIRK No wants. No needs. We weren't meant for that. None of us. Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is. 
__label__KIRK Transporter room, beam Mister Spock aboard. 
__label__KIRK Fire phasers. (the missiles are obliterated) Mister Chekov, alter course to the missile's point of origin. 
__label__KIRK No. It was a calculated risk. Still, the Eminians keep a very orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business. A very, very messy business. I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid it, even talk peace. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately. 
__label__KIRK Ahead full. 
__label__KIRK Good. Get everybody else aboard the Enterprise. The fewer people we have breathing the air down here, the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out. How much longer, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK What success did you have? 
__label__KIRK Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.
__label__KIRK What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK But this time, you were in Orion's past with us when the historians had the time vortex replay Vulcan history. You couldn't be in two places at once, so you died as a boy. Guardian! Did you hear that? 
__label__KIRK Ambassador, there's an added complication. The Federation High Commissioner will be attending the wedding. 
__label__KIRK Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late. I don't see any tribbles around here. 
__label__KIRK Bring it aboard? If the antimatter touches the inside of the ship or any of us, we'll be blown to bits. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the tricorder) What do you make of that?
__label__KIRK We're going to find out, Doctor. (At the foot of the Jefferies tube) 
__label__KIRK Spock. Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Fortunate. We will vacate at once. 
__label__KIRK You'll be the first to know. 
__label__KIRK He's a healer, let him heal. Mister Spock, you must re-establish communications. I want to know why it suddenly took to murder. 
__label__KIRK Self-inflicted. 
__label__KIRK Do you deny it? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Your surprise package is an Air Police sergeant from the base. 
__label__KIRK Same way? Burned? 
__label__KIRK Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK You know as much as I do, Bones. 
__label__KIRK By the alien ship?
__label__KIRK We're getting something. 
__label__KIRK You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover him. Now listen, sweetheart. The Federation's moving in, taking over.
__label__KIRK We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them. 
__label__KIRK The planet might be hollow. They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes. It's dark. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay. 
__label__KIRK Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go. 
__label__KIRK No, I'm not. I want you to find what you once had. I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth. 
__label__KIRK Transporter room, on the double. 
__label__KIRK Like you were at Cestus Three?
__label__KIRK Nomad, I made an error in creating you. 
__label__KIRK Well, let's get started. 
__label__KIRK Can you do anything for him? 
__label__KIRK A lighting panel. 
__label__KIRK You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display. 
__label__KIRK They selected us as the most compatible bodies. 
__label__KIRK Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.
__label__KIRK It's wounded. Badly. You've got to help it. 
__label__KIRK Spock! 
__label__KIRK He never mentioned that his family was this important. 
__label__KIRK But it may be just what we need to shake the Romulans. Batten down, we're going through. 
__label__KIRK It doesn't work. 
__label__KIRK Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles! 
__label__KIRK Anything? 
__label__KIRK Did they hurt you? 
__label__KIRK Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen? (flash)
__label__KIRK Lock in for another blast. 
__label__KIRK It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Spock, it's your   As these little surprises have grown more and more frequent, our crew members have found them less and less amusing. 
__label__KIRK Well, certainly no ordinary thief, considering what it is you appropriated. 
__label__KIRK All right. On my way. 
__label__KIRK Hold your position. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer. 
__label__KIRK Then get me impulse power. Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything.
__label__KIRK Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go on! 
__label__KIRK All right. Take D'Amato's tricorder. Set it for automatic distress. You never can tell. 
__label__KIRK Could it cure her? 
__label__KIRK I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of this expedition, an hour ago. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK Engineering, cut power on starboard side. Maintain until further orders. Chekov. 
__label__KIRK You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory? 
__label__KIRK Oh, Ensign, meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up. I'd like to talk to you about your father. Several tall stories I think you'd like to hear. 
__label__KIRK Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over? 
__label__KIRK Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK But it will die finally. You seem very happy about the whole thing. 
__label__KIRK Post him. 
__label__KIRK No. To isolate someone like Lucien, that's the same as sentencing him to death. 
__label__KIRK Why? Because your people have nothing of your own? Is that why you need us? 
__label__KIRK Fire only on my signal. Flank out. 
__label__KIRK Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though, once. Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean. 
__label__KIRK Activate warp drive! 
__label__KIRK We'll need something else for bait. 
__label__KIRK Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us.
__label__KIRK What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK You have twelve hours to consider your position. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Anything? 
__label__KIRK Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.
__label__KIRK Are you machine or being? 
__label__KIRK Then go ahead, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Very well, Mister Spock. I'll meet you at the other end. 
__label__KIRK Keep me posted, Mister Spock. We'll continue our investigation down here. Captain out. 
__label__KIRK (to nurse) If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room. 
__label__KIRK Sabotage! How? When? 
__label__KIRK If we don't try, Spock doesn't have a chance. 
__label__KIRK The thralls have no freedom, Shahna. You don't think or do anything but what the Providers tell you. 
__label__KIRK Beautiful specimen. 
__label__KIRK Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor. 
__label__KIRK I don't know what's going on, but the first officer of this ship will be treated with respect. 
__label__KIRK You did that, Professor. You told them in time. 
__label__KIRK He did exactly what I would have done. I won't underestimate him again. Now, fire blind. Lay down a pattern. STILES: Traverse pattern.
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK That's fine, Harry. The androids will be expecting us to make a break for it, and that's where you come in. 
__label__KIRK Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive defensive move. What's a Klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway? 
__label__KIRK You have time to save some people, Bob. 
__label__KIRK Or what he felt. Damage report, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Get ready to move. We've got to follow Spock inside that trapdoor. 
__label__KIRK McCoy, get out of the way! 
__label__KIRK Face to face? Where? 
__label__KIRK Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! 
__label__KIRK None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a human nightmare. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK The inevitable outcome? 
__label__KIRK Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What?
__label__KIRK Earth-style distress signal. SOS. 
__label__KIRK Launch shuttlecraft. 
__label__KIRK Good, go ahead. 
__label__KIRK Bones, I believe you're getting grey. 
__label__KIRK We're now headed for your new home. The planet Verdanis, ten days distant. 
__label__KIRK No, there's more to it than that.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, we have guests. Adjust transporter to wide field.
__label__KIRK Let her rant. There's nothing to say. 
__label__KIRK I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha? 
__label__KIRK I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills, to do as she wills, to think as she wills. 
__label__KIRK Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK You left it? 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings, chemical pollutions, any further sign of life. 
__label__KIRK I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and children in that colony. What are the chances of survivors? 
__label__KIRK Well, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK All right, Zeon pigs, move. (He stumbles against the Nazi.) Zeon pigs. They do nothing right. Don't worry. They're on their way to the laboratory, for experimental work. They'll pay. Move! 
__label__KIRK Spock. 
__label__KIRK I insist. 
__label__KIRK Pressure! 
__label__KIRK I'm your commander, Compton. I order you to let me in. 
__label__KIRK Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies. You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise. 
__label__KIRK I'm aware of that, Commissioner. At the same time I have certain scientific duties I must perform, and investigating the Murasaki effect is one. 
__label__KIRK The opening where we were drawn in seems to have closed. But there's another opening up there on top. 
__label__KIRK We need our communicators, those devices on our belts. If there's a Klingon ship somewhere  AKAAR: The sky does not interest me. I must consider the words I have heard. 
__label__KIRK Compared to the beings that built this ship, we are primitive people, even you, Mister Spock. All right, let's keep going. 
__label__KIRK We're hundreds of light years from Earth, Mister Spock. No colonies or vessels out this far. 
__label__KIRK All right, Scotty, let's have it. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, I want a twenty four hour regressive memory check made on Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Yeoman Rand, how long was this Green with you? 
__label__KIRK Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later.
__label__KIRK Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you. 
__label__KIRK Your statement is illogical. 
__label__KIRK Of course it does. Maybe it is the same. 
__label__KIRK That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen. 
__label__KIRK Good. Hold your position. We're locked onto your co-ordinates.
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job. 
__label__KIRK Very good. (he tries a grape) Excellent. 
__label__KIRK Why do you want to kill us? 
__label__KIRK You said we? 
__label__KIRK Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can do anything to stop them. 
__label__KIRK In other words, we're going down to one sixteenth of an inch high. 
__label__KIRK Let's get that ryetalyn. 
__label__KIRK Good. Open it. 
__label__KIRK Well, we're still faced with the same problem. 
__label__KIRK Warp us out of here.
__label__KIRK If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, our estimated time of arrival for Ariannus? 
__label__KIRK If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself. 
__label__KIRK What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?
__label__KIRK Where? 
__label__KIRK Very good. How are you doing on the force field? 
__label__KIRK His biological functions have ceased. 
__label__KIRK We can take care of ourselves. 
__label__KIRK Anything further, gentlemen?
__label__KIRK She's a good ship. (takes a glass from a passing tray) Thank you.
__label__KIRK There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people.
__label__KIRK Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings. Don't wait to investigate. 
__label__KIRK I didn't ask for any.
__label__KIRK An alien life force. We must make contact, find out what it wants. 
__label__KIRK Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me? 
__label__KIRK Set your phasers on stun. We're going to beam directly into the capital city. Alert status. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Thank you.
__label__KIRK You issued a priority one distress call for a couple of tons of wheat? 
__label__KIRK I hate to ask, but  SCOTT: Aye, Captain. We'll squeeze a wee bit more speed out of her. 
__label__KIRK Analysis, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Can you explain that, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured! 
__label__KIRK Hailing frequencies. Aurora, this is the USS Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk commanding. Acknowledge. Aurora, this is the Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen. 
__label__KIRK The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing.
__label__KIRK Make sure it does, Spock. If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them. 
__label__KIRK Course of the missile, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK They're experts at gunfighting. We don't have a chance. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men. We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit.
__label__KIRK It came from back there. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, take it easy. 
__label__KIRK Can you handle it, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Spock, you knew? 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's right, Bones. 
__label__KIRK I want to know how I'm free, and why. 
__label__KIRK Did you operate on Spock in time? 
__label__KIRK They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel I actually met Lincoln. 
__label__KIRK Status report. 
__label__KIRK Spock, if your theory is correct, we should be able to open up this planet again by using a fake victim as bait. 
__label__KIRK You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not another's. 
__label__KIRK Can you identify that? 
__label__KIRK Lazarus, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living  DEELA: Burns them out. 
__label__KIRK Any identification on the attacking vessel? 
__label__KIRK We came in peace. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. I'll try and find out. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system. If they want to fight, Let's get some manoeuvering room. 
__label__KIRK You stole this. You'll start a bloody crusade across the galaxy.
__label__KIRK But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something. 
__label__KIRK Captain. Standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship.
__label__KIRK Out.
__label__KIRK There's something wrong about this room. 
__label__KIRK How long do we have? 
__label__KIRK Go to warp six.
__label__KIRK Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?
__label__KIRK Beam us aboard.
__label__KIRK Yeah, it's nice. If we're a little more careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble. 
__label__KIRK Not necessarily. 
__label__KIRK You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals? 
__label__KIRK Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened. 
__label__KIRK Wait. Listen. 
__label__KIRK The turbulence hit you that hard? 
__label__KIRK Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about those deaths, on my responsibility. I am perfectly aware that it might cost lives on Theta Seven. Kirk out. Autopsy report. 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not the first time. Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat. 
__label__KIRK Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth manifestations. Why? 
__label__KIRK Then why are you afraid? (he embraces her) Don't be afraid. 
__label__KIRK Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?
__label__KIRK You'll do it?
__label__KIRK I see what you mean. 
__label__KIRK Inside the Enterprise? Can you pinpoint it? 
__label__KIRK No. No. It must be here someplace. 
__label__KIRK Wheels, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Shut up, Spock! 
__label__KIRK He has two more. 
__label__KIRK Seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning.
__label__KIRK I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV. 
__label__KIRK And your name? 
__label__KIRK Full security, Johnson, on the double. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you understand? 
__label__KIRK They won't hurt you, Charlie. (security arrive) They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them. 
__label__KIRK You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the last time you visited Earth? 
__label__KIRK Why not? 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals. 
__label__KIRK We must be somewhere inside that other ship. 
__label__KIRK All right, Korob. What do you want from us? 
__label__KIRK We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time. 
__label__KIRK You've just suggested something that never occurred to me. It may provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor McCoy is looking at this very moment. 
__label__KIRK Take him with us, Mister Spock. He's got a point. He's our guide.
__label__KIRK Acknowledged. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he? 
__label__KIRK And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her. 
__label__KIRK Keep trying. 
__label__KIRK How do you communicate with it? 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed.
__label__KIRK Wait! 
__label__KIRK Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get. 
__label__KIRK Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them. 
__label__KIRK You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions orders. 
__label__KIRK The source of it? 
__label__KIRK I don't understand. 
__label__KIRK Helmsman, stabilise position.
__label__KIRK You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage. 
__label__KIRK Not our problem, Bones.
__label__KIRK And you, Stiles? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk.
__label__KIRK I understand you're not happy with your quarters. 
__label__KIRK It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. Sulu. This is nothing? 
__label__KIRK Do you want to be like him? 
__label__KIRK And if I don't? 
__label__KIRK Engineering. Scotty. This is the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I thought you might. 
__label__KIRK The creation point. 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me. 
__label__KIRK Then run it twenty times if that's what it takes!
__label__KIRK It's not animal tissue. What is it? 
__label__KIRK Many times. 
__label__KIRK We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids.
__label__KIRK Help me! Help! Help me! 
__label__KIRK And Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of power. The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but the only one that preserves both sides. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, as you were. Chekov! 
__label__KIRK If she is to survive, we can't attack. 
__label__KIRK Lars and Chekov's drill thrall. They weren't born here. Where do they come from? 
__label__KIRK We always encourage our officers to make friends with the natives. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, are the warp drives still out? 
__label__KIRK On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK He's an android like Brown? 
__label__KIRK All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not. You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. From now on, it's going to be under one roof. You're going to run it like a business. That means you're going to make a profit. 
__label__KIRK Keep me together for another seven minutes. That's all I need. 
__label__KIRK Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst? 
__label__KIRK By whose order? 
__label__KIRK And now  KHAN: Khan is my name. 
__label__KIRK What would you do in my place? 
__label__KIRK Spock. Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Spock. SPOCK: These are the attack computers, Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts. 
__label__KIRK Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it. 
__label__KIRK I'm aware of that, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Have you covered every possibility? Every factor? 
__label__KIRK If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying. 
__label__KIRK You speculate. 
__label__KIRK I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed command? 
__label__KIRK You're beaming cargo down to a penal colony, Mister Berkeley.
__label__KIRK Tricorder analysis, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I've never heard that language before. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here, Captain Ramart. 
__label__KIRK How is it down there? 
__label__KIRK A simple transference. Their minds and ours. 
__label__KIRK You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it. Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba? 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course correction. Helmsman, steady as she goes.  
__label__KIRK (reading) Intermediate experimentation report project on life prolongation. 
__label__KIRK Bridge. Navigation. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we were? 
__label__KIRK You said you wanted freedom. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Come on. We're going to find Landru. 
__label__KIRK We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship. 
__label__KIRK Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned? 
__label__KIRK Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they've ever had. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK You'd better get some rest.
__label__KIRK Reduce speed to sub warp cruise. We'll lay by here for repairs. 
__label__KIRK All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours? 
__label__KIRK My First Officer, Commander Spock. 
__label__KIRK The other. 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK I gambled on his humanity. 
__label__KIRK If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mister Flint if necessary. 
__label__KIRK Insulted, Spock? 
__label__KIRK You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that.
__label__KIRK Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.
__label__KIRK Let's find McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Think, man. The Enterprise. The ship. Remember? 
__label__KIRK We'll keep you posted, Doctor. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard. 
__label__KIRK Lock us onto your screen. 
__label__KIRK This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five minutes. 
__label__KIRK Very good. Have the transporter room stand by. 
__label__KIRK Where are the others? 
__label__KIRK Yes, we're aware of that. If mining conditions weren't so difficult, Janus Six could supply the mineral needs of a thousand planets. But what happened? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK We do not intend to die. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Coleman, if you're required here, we'll call you. 
__label__KIRK Something? 
__label__KIRK Set.
__label__KIRK I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack. 
__label__KIRK Why not? 
__label__KIRK Do they come for your women as well? 
__label__KIRK No. Yes. My ship. 
__label__KIRK I've seen stranger things, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose  TRELANE: You still haven't learned. You have no choice. Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome. It's all so very easy. 
__label__KIRK The little ones? Look like you? Just go on the way you're going.
__label__KIRK Estimated arrival at Tantalus?
__label__KIRK Then help me. 
__label__KIRK Compensate. 
__label__KIRK I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one you've been playing. I'm sorry, Shahna. I didn't lie. I did what was necessary. Someday, I hope you'll understand. 
__label__KIRK Transporter ready?
__label__KIRK Trelane. 
__label__KIRK Ahead slow. Impulse power only. 
__label__KIRK Spock, anyone in the transporter room? 
__label__KIRK Steady as she goes. Phaser crew, stand by. 
__label__KIRK I don't think so. 
__label__KIRK Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is. 
__label__KIRK You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along? 
__label__KIRK Could conditions necessary to such an event be created artificially using the ship's power? 
__label__KIRK As long as we're alive, there's a chance. Tonight, I'll try and find a weak link in the force field. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Good. Mister Chekov, this flight is supposed to provide both experience and knowledge. How close will we come to the Klingon outpost if we continue on our present course? 
__label__KIRK All decks, security alert. Locate and restrain Mister Spock. He may be dangerous. Use phasers on stun if necessary. 
__label__KIRK I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe. Its mission was essentially peaceful. 
__label__KIRK Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel. Let them take it at their own speed. 
__label__KIRK Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend. 
__label__KIRK Excuse me, Miss. Where are we? 
__label__KIRK No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're  [Ice Age]
__label__KIRK That doesn't answer my question, sir. Why did all your animals die? 
__label__KIRK Keep trying to raise them. 
__label__KIRK Identification, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check? 
__label__KIRK Aurora personnel, stand by to be transported aboard. Energise. 
__label__KIRK What do you want me to say? M-5 is an honour, they tell me. Well, I'm honoured. 
__label__KIRK Ready. 
__label__KIRK Klingon! Communicators, weapons. 
__label__KIRK Analysis sector. Have them study and decode it. 
__label__KIRK Weapons status, Mister Scott? We may have to protect ourselves. 
__label__KIRK How does that sound to you, Keniclius? To bring life is at least as important as bringing peace. 
__label__KIRK Lights. 
__label__KIRK Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then? 
__label__KIRK Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it? Do you think I'm completely without feelings, Mister Spock? You saw what it did for Scotty. What a doctor it would've made. My son, the doctor. Kind of gets you right there, doesn't it?  
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Coleman. 
__label__KIRK Beam me up, Mister Spock. We're free to go. 
__label__KIRK Get him out of here. 
__label__KIRK But if it were true, all these generations of Yanks fighting to regain their land. 
__label__KIRK I won't hurt you. 
__label__KIRK Help me return to the library. I've lost my way. I must get back there. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order. 
__label__KIRK Spock, is it possible the cloud consumes planets? 
__label__KIRK Those are conditions most people would envy. 
__label__KIRK You offered me the lives of my crew. 
__label__KIRK That ship was a Federation-built craft. The pilot is under our protection. 
__label__KIRK Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle, it is only because we have no choice. 
__label__KIRK Don't be afraid. 
__label__KIRK Look! Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives. A thousand lifetimes. Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us. 
__label__KIRK Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight.
__label__KIRK Open hailing frequencies again, Lieutenant. Tell her she is endangering her life if she remains on her present course. 
__label__KIRK You too, Vanna. You too! Dig! Kirk here. What is it? 
__label__KIRK How much of the twelve hours do we have left? 
__label__KIRK I logged the mistake, Ben. Blame me, not them. 
__label__KIRK Sometimes a feeling, Mister Spock, is all we humans have to go on. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency! 
__label__KIRK Not by killing others. 
__label__KIRK Look at me. Look at me. What do you see? 
__label__KIRK Do these clothes look like yours? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, come about. Three one eight mark seven. 
__label__KIRK Bridge.
__label__KIRK Go on, Trelane. Look at it. It's over. Your power is blanked out.
__label__KIRK Mister Scott. Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Put the signal on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and pipe the entire exchange back to Starfleet Command. 
__label__KIRK Yes, anything! Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.
__label__KIRK Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery. 
__label__KIRK Make course for Starbase Twelve. 
__label__KIRK This cousin, what was his name? 
__label__KIRK Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite. 
__label__KIRK I have my reasons, and I'll make them clear to you in my own good time. 
__label__KIRK Love, for one thing. 
__label__KIRK Can you help him? 
__label__KIRK You're disturbed about what happened today. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?
__label__KIRK Why not?  COGLEY: I've got my own system. Books, young man, books. Thousands of them. If time wasn't so important, I'd show you something. My library.
__label__KIRK Why not all three? 
__label__KIRK Orbit where? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Why would they want it? Eight hours and thirty four minutes.
__label__KIRK They left. Out of orbit. 
__label__KIRK I'd like a few minutes to inform my crew. 
__label__KIRK Our communicators, weapons. 
__label__KIRK Antibodies. Antibodies. (goes to desk monitor) Bridge. 
__label__KIRK How do you do? 
__label__KIRK We're on our way, Doctor. We'll be with you in a moment.
__label__KIRK Kirk to transporter room. 
__label__KIRK You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago. 
__label__KIRK And I would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns and we can't risk both of us being off the ship. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman. Don't let us upset you. 
__label__KIRK No. Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius. 
__label__KIRK There he is. I don't know how he did it, but he got through. Come on, we'll have to go around. That Pandronian's actions just don't make sense. 
__label__KIRK Any sign of survivors? 
__label__KIRK Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our ship? 
__label__KIRK Reverse full power. 
__label__KIRK You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders. 
__label__KIRK That's very flattering. I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth. 
__label__KIRK Quite all right. 
__label__KIRK Keep trying. We've got a diplomatic tiger by the tail. 
__label__KIRK We'll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed. 
__label__KIRK Our record tapes show, although not generally revealed, that on this date, a malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the Earth. 
__label__KIRK My only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we're on.
__label__KIRK I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it. But not to the exclusion and safety of the Enterprise. Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, what are you staring at? 
__label__KIRK Never mind. Just come down to the twenty third level. You'll be led to us by tricorder readings. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK What is it, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Battle status? 
__label__KIRK That's paradise? 
__label__KIRK What do you mean, beings like yourselves? 
__label__KIRK That cat. 
__label__KIRK Under no circumstances do I want anyone to beam down from the ship. We can't take any chances with further contamination. 
__label__KIRK You don't agree with Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it. 
__label__KIRK We are from the United Federation of Planets. 
__label__KIRK I could confine her to quarters. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it, Enterprise? 
__label__KIRK There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can get gratification, I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects. 
__label__KIRK Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Mister Atoz. Mister Atoz! 
__label__KIRK Well, you can be hurt, can't you? We just sit here? It's your move. 
__label__KIRK Plot it. 
__label__KIRK Main screen. Extreme magnification. 
__label__KIRK I'm sick of hearing that word can't. Get that ship out of there. 
__label__KIRK We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting. If you'll go with Mister Scott, I'm sure the two of you will have a great deal in common. 
__label__KIRK Your Surak is a brave man. 
__label__KIRK Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for. 
__label__KIRK McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. So are yours. 
__label__KIRK What about my ship? My crew? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Do it.
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon. A silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order. It's possible that our phasers might not affect it. 
__label__KIRK Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to return Captain Christopher and the guard? 
__label__KIRK Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty, Spock, stand by in the transporter room. 
__label__KIRK What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean them no harm. 
__label__KIRK Blast you any way. You had no right to come along.
__label__KIRK I don't have to, Bones. We both know he is. 
__label__KIRK Spock, take the conn. Talk to the Romulans. Try to stall them.
__label__KIRK Too many tunnels. We couldn't possibly. Mister Spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance, but what about abnormal life functions? 
__label__KIRK I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone. 
__label__KIRK Bones was right. These people aren't living, they're existing.
__label__KIRK Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders? 
__label__KIRK Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Is that all? 
__label__KIRK A minute. 
__label__KIRK We enjoy it. 
__label__KIRK That other ship may have been able to survive the heat of a nova, but the Enterprise can't. Mister Scott, how about that full braking power? 
__label__KIRK I'll discuss that only with him. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on. 
__label__KIRK Listen to me. This may be our last chance.
__label__KIRK The transponders. 
__label__KIRK All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice. 
__label__KIRK This is an odd time to remain adamant. All right, let's go.
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK No, no! Don't shoot. Come on over, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Let us both take steps to keep it that way. 
__label__KIRK Stay there! Come on! 
__label__KIRK What is it, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK What happened to Spock? 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk here. Please answer red priority. Please answer red priority. Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering. 
__label__KIRK And the tribbles had nothing to do with it? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, get a security team down here on the double. 
__label__KIRK Spock, save your power for the shields. 
__label__KIRK What about the ship? 
__label__KIRK Let's get a closer look at it before the phaser stun wears off.
__label__KIRK Is that your best recommendation?
__label__KIRK Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered. 
__label__KIRK We'll make a present of him to Melakon. 
__label__KIRK (a whisper) You gave them to the Klingons? 
__label__KIRK Their captivity. Do you enjoy the music? 
__label__KIRK Companion, try to understand. It is the nature of our species to be free, just as it is your nature to stay here. We will cease to exist in captivity. 
__label__KIRK Little ones like yourselves. They grow. 
__label__KIRK I am Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock and honorary Commander Ari bn Bem of the planet Pandro. 
__label__KIRK A war? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK The gun. Ammunition. Doctor. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Is anyone on board?
__label__KIRK Yes, Scotty. How are we doing down there? 
__label__KIRK Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Something new to me. 
__label__KIRK Mea. What do you think you're doing? 
__label__KIRK Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range in three hours. If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be. 
__label__KIRK Who aboard would have that knowledge? 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK Activate. 
__label__KIRK Draw it? I demand it. And right now, Commodore Stone. Right now.
__label__KIRK And almost died. I remember. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. 
__label__KIRK You were on the bridge when we were attacked. 
__label__KIRK What are you doing about it? 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK I have to, Bones. Look at this place. A tank. I can't command a ship from inside an aquarium. I can't live in here. 
__label__KIRK Phasers on stun. Sweep the area. 
__label__KIRK Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they? 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on her when it became serious. 
__label__KIRK Commander, that puppet.
__label__KIRK Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Professor. Professor! You've got to talk! You've got to tell them what happened. You've got to come out of it. Come on, Professor. Come on. Come on.
__label__KIRK Who? 
__label__KIRK Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference? 
__label__KIRK Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Adams? This is Captain Kirk. It appears we may have an inmate of yours aboard the ship.
__label__KIRK You're still at war? 
__label__KIRK Agreed. We'll try to make for the eye of the storm. 
__label__KIRK Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not? 
__label__KIRK You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation? 
__label__KIRK Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty. 
__label__KIRK Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.
__label__KIRK I don't know what you are but you're not a woman. You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them. You ask for love and return pain instead. 
__label__KIRK Now he tells me. 
__label__KIRK Captain to Bridge.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. 
__label__KIRK No, him. 
__label__KIRK Edith. 
__label__KIRK If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach. 
__label__KIRK As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency. 
__label__KIRK That doesn't sound like the same man. 
__label__KIRK Not when I came in. 
__label__KIRK It was working before. Try it again. 
__label__KIRK I don't know how to get inside. 
__label__KIRK Agmar said something about a weapons deactivator. Mister Sulu, lock ship's phasers on that laboratory building. Use a wide area stun setting. 
__label__KIRK I've loved you.
__label__KIRK Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it? 
__label__KIRK Keep your phasers locked on target, Mister Sulu. Hold your fire until they fire first. 
__label__KIRK I'm aware of that, Mister Stiles. Are phasers ready? 
__label__KIRK Ship to ship.
__label__KIRK Your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Standing by, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK For the same reasons you excite me. You're a very beautiful woman. 
__label__KIRK Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves. Neither side felt could pull out. 
__label__KIRK Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here? 
__label__KIRK Don't you think you better check with me first? 
__label__KIRK And the same to you, Miss Lincoln. Energise.  
__label__KIRK There must be a reason. 
__label__KIRK Now, Mister Sulu. (the ship lurches sideways) More power, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark.
__label__KIRK Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it. 
__label__KIRK (throws a tantrum) No! No! No! (ends up thumping the floor until he changes beck to Garth.
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Rodriguez.
__label__KIRK I hope your computations are correct, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK No, that's not it. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, cease fire. 
__label__KIRK Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain. 
__label__KIRK Wait just a bit longer. 
__label__KIRK Alien bodies, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Let me see. It's just a thorn. I was hoping to make you forget about this today. 
__label__KIRK That's the idea. 
__label__KIRK You'd better let us. (draws the phaser) It's out of energy. She must have drained it. We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time.
__label__KIRK Double the charge. 
__label__KIRK Activate the bridge monitor screen. 
__label__KIRK Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage them with a reasonable possibility of victory? 
__label__KIRK Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however. 
__label__KIRK Bones. I had the strangest dream. 
__label__KIRK Thanks, Bones. Lieutenant Uhura, send a priority one call to Governor Wesley on Mantilles. 
__label__KIRK Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Doctor Jones. 
__label__KIRK No. The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but it's better than exterminating them. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Ready to beam over. Have the medical team standing by. 
__label__KIRK Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta? 
__label__KIRK Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee? 
__label__KIRK Pull out its plug, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Never seen that in a medical book. 
__label__KIRK What's keeping the processing this time? 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK I'm going to take it, and I'm going to (door opens)
__label__KIRK For one thing it means we're stranded. 
__label__KIRK Spock, is that you? 
__label__KIRK A bit. 
__label__KIRK Janice, take Miri for a walk. 
__label__KIRK Grant, no! 
__label__KIRK I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you. 
__label__KIRK You're needed everywhere, Odona. 
__label__KIRK Stay close to Spock. Stall for time. And hope. 
__label__KIRK Give us some altitude, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command. 
__label__KIRK Computer on. Record. 
__label__KIRK Get down to emergency manual control. Try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power. 
__label__KIRK It's a very interesting proposition. Let me think it over. 
__label__KIRK Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward.
__label__KIRK We still don't know what's happened to the Archons. Which way?
__label__KIRK How? 
__label__KIRK Your orders, Lieutenant. He wants to see your orders in the jacket. The Lieutenant's a little dazed. He captured several Zeons single-handed. One of the pigs struck him before he dropped. I promise you that pig will never get up again. 
__label__KIRK Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. 
__label__KIRK I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans.
__label__KIRK Release the transmitter. 
__label__KIRK We come from another province. 
__label__KIRK I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako. 
__label__KIRK Occasionally. Why? 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK How am I otherwise? 
__label__KIRK Identification? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Doctor. Bridge out. Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, what are our chances? 
__label__KIRK Our heading is Starbase Twelve, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system. Our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you? 
__label__KIRK Certainly. 
__label__KIRK Spock. Spock! 
__label__KIRK On one condition, Prefect. That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on. 
__label__KIRK If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights? Take out that device in the life-support system? 
__label__KIRK All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now. Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies. Something that thrives on fear, terror, death. Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong way. Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive. That she did sense something, something evil. 
__label__KIRK You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build facilities. 
__label__KIRK Dismissed, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK That's a trinary sun. 
__label__KIRK Did he seem upset? 
__label__KIRK What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready. 
__label__KIRK Where is Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know. We saw it. 
__label__KIRK I think you're right. Continue investigating. The clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere. 
__label__KIRK Scotty! Where are the tribbles? 
__label__KIRK No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her. 
__label__KIRK From that ship. She took it. I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it. Bones, how long can you keep him functioning? 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. What is it? 
__label__KIRK What caused the red alert? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James Kirk  FLINT: I know who you are. I have monitored your ship since it entered this system. 
__label__KIRK Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid. 
__label__KIRK Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Yeah. 
__label__KIRK And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment.
__label__KIRK I'm not sure. I went down to my quarters to dictate the accident report and I seem to have fallen asleep. I've never done that before. 
__label__KIRK Engineering, this is the captain. I want full emergency power. I want everything within about two minutes. I want the warp drive engines on full standby. Kirk out. Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command. Code two. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm here. You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you and the others. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Adams? Doctor A. The treatment room. Follow me.
__label__KIRK Oh, Spock, one question. 
__label__KIRK Get off my ship. 
__label__KIRK We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go.
__label__KIRK Kirk here. What is it? 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK She tried to help Marvick. Marvick is dead. 
__label__KIRK Affirmative. 
__label__KIRK Your report covers all vegetation? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, have those transporter circuits checked. 
__label__KIRK Surely we can communicate with them some way. 
__label__KIRK I see you didn't waste time taking your shore leave. 
__label__KIRK I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones? 
__label__KIRK Kirk out.  STONE: It's a great pity. The service can't afford to lose men like Lieutenant Commander Finney. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter Room. Kirk to Bridge. Do you read me? Come in. 
__label__KIRK Yes. We do think a great deal about it. 
__label__KIRK His name was at the top of the duty roster. 
__label__KIRK Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin.
__label__KIRK There's no way into that place from up here. Prefect, is there another entrance to that chamber? 
__label__KIRK Nothing. Are you locked in on me? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, check the cargo hold. See if the drug is there. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's too bad. Why do you defy him? 
__label__KIRK There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate them has been destroyed. 
__label__KIRK What bearing? 
__label__KIRK They're children. 
__label__KIRK They're celebrating. 
__label__KIRK How old are you? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible. 
__label__KIRK What is it, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Very good, Spock. We may make a human of you yet. 
__label__KIRK Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mister Advisor. 
__label__KIRK I'm paralysed. 
__label__KIRK A personal conflict between us. Not like the duel before, but the real thing. The stakes, a human life. Mine. 
__label__KIRK Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action. 
__label__KIRK Very good, Mister Chekov. That might very well mean something. 
__label__KIRK Phasers. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector Nine. Pipe it down to McCoy's office. 
__label__KIRK We hope through our medical assistance programs. to develop and strengthen relations with star systems such as yours, Supreme Prefect.
__label__KIRK Bones, how is he? 
__label__KIRK We could use some more, if you don't mind. 
__label__KIRK Our thoughts will intertwine. 
__label__KIRK Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the intruder? 
__label__KIRK What was it you sensed? 
__label__KIRK How can you ignore that? 
__label__KIRK What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in the library. In the library.
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder. Several of them left just before Mister Scott and the girl did. 
__label__KIRK Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together.
__label__KIRK We've out grown you. You asked for something we could no longer give. 
__label__KIRK Do we have impulse power, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Get to the Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Very good. Thank you, Mister Scott. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK I'll be right there. Notify Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos. 
__label__KIRK Bridge. 
__label__KIRK They have to answer. 
__label__KIRK Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar?
__label__KIRK You can't think a man to death. 
__label__KIRK What sterilisation procedure? 
__label__KIRK And when something unexplained happens, their routine is disrupted. 
__label__KIRK Helen.
__label__KIRK We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Doc. How? 
__label__KIRK It must have been tied in to the tape viewer somehow. 
__label__KIRK Well, I'm sure that Sargon appreciated your co-operation, Doctor Mulhall. 
__label__KIRK You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing. 
__label__KIRK Can't it wait, Bones? 
__label__KIRK A place to sleep. 
__label__KIRK And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.
__label__KIRK In here, I presume, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Could more Klingons have beamed aboard? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking, a form of punishment administered to spoiled brats. 
__label__KIRK Totally. This is the Captain. Put a twenty four hour security on Mister Khan's quarters, effective immediately. 
__label__KIRK Anything? 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather. 
__label__KIRK Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?
__label__KIRK The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find these people. They were there, now they're not. Nor is Crewman Compton.
__label__KIRK But where are they? 
__label__KIRK This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking out phenomenon? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Doctor Adams. 
__label__KIRK It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine. 
__label__KIRK You've got it. I'll order the wardrobe section to prepare it now.
__label__KIRK Everything's secure here. Maintain position. If everything goes according to plan, you can beam us up in ten minutes. If you don't hear from us, carry out General Order Twenty Four on schedule. 
__label__KIRK Invasion status. All hands, this is the Captain. Battle stations.
__label__KIRK Permission granted.
__label__KIRK Mister Fox, it is their planet. 
__label__KIRK What was the reason for the dispersal? 
__label__KIRK I doubt that, Bones, but continue. 
__label__KIRK Is there anything you do? 
__label__KIRK Uhura?  UHURA [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
__label__KIRK If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible. 
__label__KIRK New course? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck. Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Those words are familiar. Wait a moment. 
__label__KIRK Yes. When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved with him. Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis. 
__label__KIRK One of Mudd's love crystals. 
__label__KIRK Sorry.
__label__KIRK Can we track it? 
__label__KIRK Who could have done such a thing? 
__label__KIRK No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can teach you. There's nothing you do not know. 
__label__KIRK We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did. 
__label__KIRK Johnson! 
__label__KIRK Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that? 
__label__KIRK You're fired. Four hundred people  MCCOY: Jim  KIRK: They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign. I had to follow orders, always orders. 
__label__KIRK And after they are finished in Sickbay, see to it that they're escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need. 
__label__KIRK Keep those screens up. Fire all phasers. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, are you there? 
__label__KIRK Not fright. Hunger. Look at her. 
__label__KIRK I took over the Enterprise from him. Spock served with him for several years.
__label__KIRK Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft? 
__label__KIRK Deflectors up. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man ADAMS [OC]: Is Doctor Van Gelder all right? And your people, no injuries?
__label__KIRK Warp factor seven.
__label__KIRK What can we do to stop it? 
__label__KIRK Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms? 
__label__KIRK Set course for Taurus Two. 
__label__KIRK Ready to give it a try? 
__label__KIRK Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. 
__label__KIRK Up to now, everything has gone wrong. I want it tested now. 
__label__KIRK We're all right. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, sir. I have considered all the alternatives. My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion. 
__label__KIRK Have your readings been fed into the computer? 
__label__KIRK You have one minute to restore my Bridge crew unharmed, or you will undergo full barrage. 
__label__KIRK What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there? 
__label__KIRK What happened to your ship, Matt? 
__label__KIRK You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off.
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Use the ship's sensors to locate them. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant. We offer you protection. 
__label__KIRK There must be no delay. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Turn the other heads this way! Bones, the serpent heads! Turn them to face the pyramid! I'm coming down. 
__label__KIRK But who would have the technology to build a ship that could travel at such a speed? 
__label__KIRK Let's find out. Phasers on stun. 
__label__KIRK He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I don't have to repeat myself. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, stand by. We're doing the best we can. How's Mister Sulu?
__label__KIRK Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu. Maintain orbit. 
__label__KIRK Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store.  
__label__KIRK Excellent. What's the emergency? 
__label__KIRK Bones, Scotty, quiet. 
__label__KIRK It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons. 
__label__KIRK Audio cut off, Spock. 
__label__KIRK All right. I'll handle it down here. Kirk out. (taking the model from Sylvia and the phaser from Spock) You've won. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock and I refuse to participate. 
__label__KIRK Are you suggesting that I did? 
__label__KIRK We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled.
__label__KIRK But why Nazi Germany? You studied history. You knew what the Nazis were. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Will you stop hovering over me, Yeoman?
__label__KIRK No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a machine could do these things? 
__label__KIRK They're trying to force a fight. Scotty, what's our energy status? 
__label__KIRK I'm a barrel of laughs. 
__label__KIRK You're at liberty to do so, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Who are you?
__label__KIRK Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned? 
__label__KIRK So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous. Stay in pairs. If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head. Concentrate it. Maintain it. It is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt. And if it can be hurt, it can be killed. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK What is it? What happened? 
__label__KIRK You're very good at making speeches, Parmen. Just make sure that this one sinks in. Now move aside. Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise.
__label__KIRK (gazing at Janice) No beach to walk on.
__label__KIRK It's right over there. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Bones.  [Bridge]
__label__KIRK (nuzzling her neck) Transmuter? 
__label__KIRK And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take. 
__label__KIRK Strange that such a highly developed race would be violent. 
__label__KIRK I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what it is, let's use reverse logic. Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what it isn't. 
__label__KIRK Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two. Is that correct? 
__label__KIRK I accept your terms. 
__label__KIRK Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant.
__label__KIRK How long have you been alone? Are you lonely? 
__label__KIRK Unbelievable. Do you recognise those uniforms? 
__label__KIRK Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind? 
__label__KIRK We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill  (As holder of the only gun, Kirk leads the way into the corridors of the city.)
__label__KIRK Try not to think of them. Try. 
__label__KIRK They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you try? 
__label__KIRK You're in line. You might even make captain. 
__label__KIRK I think you can take the time to lock this up first.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. 
__label__KIRK Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s? 
__label__KIRK Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet. We only received her radio report last month. 
__label__KIRK Bele. The chase is finished. 
__label__KIRK What do you want? 
__label__KIRK Time until explosion? 
__label__KIRK Absorbed? 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Oh, really? 
__label__KIRK All right, Bones. Bring him along. 
__label__KIRK You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there is. Would you mind telling me  AYELBORNE: It is our way of life, Captain. 
__label__KIRK I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again, and I ordered you here. 
__label__KIRK You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining yourself. 
__label__KIRK No, keep it open. I don't like this. Nothing since the first check in. Scott and Sulu should've contacted us again a half an hour ago. 
__label__KIRK Call battle stations, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties out. 
__label__KIRK Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain. 
__label__KIRK I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing, Councilman. I could destroy this planet. 
__label__KIRK Good, Scotty. Continue scanning. We'll maintain transmission.
__label__KIRK This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and await your reply. What is it, Mister Bailey?
__label__KIRK We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it. 
__label__KIRK Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise? 
__label__KIRK Yes, I'm fine, Bones. 
__label__KIRK I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us. Captain to helmsman. 
__label__KIRK No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK One more step and I'll kill you. 
__label__KIRK And it was almost covered with us. I don't know what's going on here, but it's going to stop before someone's hurt. 
__label__KIRK You might have had something else on your mind. 
__label__KIRK Tell Spock it worked. 
__label__KIRK We must get our communicators, contact the ship. 
__label__KIRK I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm. 
__label__KIRK Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Clayton, open the hatch and let our two scientists here get on with their business. 
__label__KIRK It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace. 
__label__KIRK Any type of gaseous cloud? 
__label__KIRK Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical.
__label__KIRK Computer. Criminological files. Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper. 
__label__KIRK Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge. 
__label__KIRK I concur, Mister Spock. Set phasers to stun, just in case. 
__label__KIRK Sunlight, palm trees. We're nine hundred light years from that kind of desert, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Probably. Rank hath its privileges.
__label__KIRK Andrea, give me the weapon.
__label__KIRK Yes, what is it? 
__label__KIRK I'll change first then. Captain out.
__label__KIRK I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my second in command. 
__label__KIRK Yes. I understand. Lieutenant Marla McGivers. Given a choice of court martial or accompanying them there. 
__label__KIRK I read the book as a child, Mister Spock, but I wasn't aware you indulged in the literature of fantasy. 
__label__KIRK Take us out of here, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Mission, routine investigation and report as per ship surgeon's medical log. As for my last entry, it seems I will get to meet Doctor Adams at last. However, I would have preferred other circumstances. Sickbay. Report, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Then the young child in the playpen  KARLA: My father, Captain. 
__label__KIRK They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death. 
__label__KIRK I want you to keep him in the transporter room. No sense in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary. 
__label__KIRK More of you? How many? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark eight. 
__label__KIRK The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time anymore. 
__label__KIRK Spock, no one thought about those pterodactyls, remember? There's more at work here than our imagination. 
__label__KIRK If we miss? 
__label__KIRK You used the transporter? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room! 
__label__KIRK All available personnel, on the double. Spock, with me. 
__label__KIRK He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows. 
__label__KIRK How are the stone knives and bearskins? 
__label__KIRK Pity you can't teach me that. 
__label__KIRK Ninety seven point eight three five. Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there? 
__label__KIRK Enterprise, this is Captain Kirk. Beam us aboard. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the odds on our getting out of here? 
__label__KIRK Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva.
__label__KIRK Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK I see.
__label__KIRK Continue the alert, Lieutenant.
__label__KIRK Magnification four. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, report to the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. 
__label__KIRK Helmsman, did you hear me? 
__label__KIRK That's a weapon. Be careful with that. 
__label__KIRK Could mental disease have infected all of the crew? 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We tried to prevent you from entering the Beta Niobe nova. We assumed your ship would burn up. 
__label__KIRK Let's find out. Computer. 
__label__KIRK You're a police officer. I recognise the traditional accoutrements. 
__label__KIRK Misleading the innocent? I wonder. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends? 
__label__KIRK What direction? 
__label__KIRK And if I refuse? 
__label__KIRK Yeah. 
__label__KIRK Gas all decks but this one. 
__label__KIRK How bad? 
__label__KIRK The alien is the real threat. That's the enemy we have to wipe out. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to attend to. What is it, Mister Spock?
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK How do you know our names? 
__label__KIRK Vaal, we are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or your people. 
__label__KIRK Inscrutable? Sulu, you're the most scrutable man I know. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is. I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out. 
__label__KIRK Where are my officers? 
__label__KIRK I don't intend to start it. 
__label__KIRK Familiar. Startling. Not rational. 
__label__KIRK That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself. 
__label__KIRK How long do you think this ship can take the pounding? I've got to get up there. 
__label__KIRK Is there a path down there? 
__label__KIRK Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control. 
__label__KIRK What the devil is this? Green leaves?
__label__KIRK Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Stay between us. 
__label__KIRK It's definitely phaser resistant. We had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it. It still lives. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, get a fix on the missile's point of origin. 
__label__KIRK It would seem so. 
__label__KIRK We'll have to carry the equipment. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK My last orders. The last orders that I left for both of you. The last taped orders. 
__label__KIRK Report on magnetic storm, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. I mean to catch them. 
__label__KIRK Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible range of examinations and tests. 
__label__KIRK We have urgent business with the Fuhrer. 
__label__KIRK It worked in a lab. With the creature exposed to everything we can give it. But what about the people who are infected? 
__label__KIRK Let's go. 
__label__KIRK Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull. 
__label__KIRK Living like the Indians, and finally even looking like the American Indian. American. Yangs? Yanks? Spock, Yankees!  SPOCK: Kohms? Communists? The parallel is almost too close, Captain. It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet. 
__label__KIRK What about? 
__label__KIRK Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We have no intention of staying as your guests. 
__label__KIRK I said dismissed. 
__label__KIRK We'd be delighted. 
__label__KIRK Hard to port, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning. Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan. Can you tame a world? 
__label__KIRK If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one. A big one. 
__label__KIRK Reverse all engines. 
__label__KIRK Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones, you come with me. 
__label__KIRK No? Observe. Fore! (Mudd swings.) Boom! 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever finds this please get it to Starfleet Command. I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn. 
__label__KIRK They fired at him. 
__label__KIRK Where's Mister Seven? 
__label__KIRK The first Klingon to step aboard this ship will be the last Klingon. Full security alert, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Explain. 
__label__KIRK Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting. 
__label__KIRK Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay. 
__label__KIRK Fire as he passes, Ensign. 
__label__KIRK Captain Christopher. Captain Christopher? Security, this is the Captain. 
__label__KIRK Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint. 
__label__KIRK Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations. 
__label__KIRK We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves. We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels, Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds. Just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time. 
__label__KIRK Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to Starbase for further treatment? 
__label__KIRK I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus. 
__label__KIRK When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation. 
__label__KIRK She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger? 
__label__KIRK Can't breathe. Suffocating. Help. Can't breathe. 
__label__KIRK The knife? No. 
__label__KIRK When he was promoted to Fleet Captain.
__label__KIRK It was not deliberate, I assure you. 
__label__KIRK And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling as a boy. 
__label__KIRK Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us. 
__label__KIRK Right? 
__label__KIRK We have a medical problem. Your ex-Lord, Harry Mudd. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, sound Red Alert. Mister Chekov, deflector shields on full. Phaser gun crews, lock on target. 
__label__KIRK Swensen, Bardoli come with me. 
__label__KIRK Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of incredible effects. 
__label__KIRK That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.
__label__KIRK Time factor? 
__label__KIRK Auxiliaries? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to transporter room. Report. 
__label__KIRK It means you're a very beautiful woman. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK That's your choice, Charlie. 
__label__KIRK We're all getting away. 
__label__KIRK Contact Starbase Twelve. 
__label__KIRK Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take official  MCCOY: I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command grade. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James T. Kirk, of the starship Enterprise. We came in answer to your distress call. 
__label__KIRK Something out there can't be seen. Explanation? 
__label__KIRK Miranda! 
__label__KIRK No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. (then he sees Ruth walking towards the group) On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK I must destroy that ship completely. 
__label__KIRK I'll be right up.
__label__KIRK Do you have any proof of that? 
__label__KIRK Commander.
__label__KIRK Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses. 
__label__KIRK Execute. 
__label__KIRK Septimus, we need your help. We must go into the city. We know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently. 
__label__KIRK What neutralising operation? 
__label__KIRK Will you take us where we can find the Others? 
__label__KIRK Our pleasure, madam. As soon as you're settled I'll arrange a tour of the ship. Mister Spock will conduct you. 
__label__KIRK Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, get back. 
__label__KIRK How's O'Shea, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Warp factor two. Bring us to course one four eight mark three. 
__label__KIRK Increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had. No. The only solution is what happened back then. Balance of power. 
__label__KIRK Let's look a little further. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed. 
__label__KIRK What about the hostages? Talk. Talk. 
__label__KIRK (to Sar) You. Come with me. Mister Osborne. 
__label__KIRK Not my personal property, but I'm the captain. 
__label__KIRK You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power. Turn off your repair operation. 
__label__KIRK It is our mission. We must classify this planet. We have to test it. 
__label__KIRK Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him. 
__label__KIRK Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a biological unit, and I created you. 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK And you, are you feeling all right? 
__label__KIRK They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream. A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers. 
__label__KIRK All right. Have them report to the Bridge on the double. Mister Sulu, take us away from the Romulans. Warp factor nine.
__label__KIRK I have some questions I want to ask you. 
__label__KIRK Bones. (McCoy sedates her) Aurelan, you're safe now. 
__label__KIRK Anything from the landing party? 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and I will handle this. 
__label__KIRK But it doesn't matter if we reach the Soul. Apparently the others didn't get this far. 
__label__KIRK Engines ahead. Warp one.
__label__KIRK She likes him. Mister Chekov. The floor is no place for an officer. Attention! Now stand absolutely still. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here. 
__label__KIRK You running a nursery, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Yes. There are thirty eight of them. 
__label__KIRK Bele. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK I instituted a phase one search. 
__label__KIRK Charlie. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you make the call to Starfleet. Mister Sulu, I ordered you to change course. Mister Sulu  SULU: Captain, stay away from the controls! If you touch them, we'll be destroyed. 
__label__KIRK I prefer to call it inspired. 
__label__KIRK That's strange. 
__label__KIRK Andromeda? Why? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK The records of the Enterprise are open for your inspection. All the history of Earth and the Federation is at your disposal. Look, look at General Order number One. No starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society. Compare that with the Earth you once knew. 
__label__KIRK Launch probe. 
__label__KIRK (answers communicator) Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe! 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Good. Get him out of here. 
__label__KIRK It's a killer, Spock. I intend to render it harmless. Get down to the Brig. Run a full analysis on the mechanism. I want to know what makes that thing tick. 
__label__KIRK They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Doctor McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes. 
__label__KIRK Then we can't wait any longer. Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship. 
__label__KIRK (thumping the table) It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote. 
__label__KIRK There were no witnesses? 
__label__KIRK (reading scroll) You are hereby directed to surrender for trial by the people of Dramia, Doctor Leonard McCoy, Medical Officer, USS Enterprise. Is this some kind of joke? 
__label__KIRK How could this have seemed right to John Gill? 
__label__KIRK Very well, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Scotty? 
__label__KIRK James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK The Klingons are free. They're armed as we are. They'll try to take the ship. Scotty, how many men do we have? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Don't you take shelter? 
__label__KIRK This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite.
__label__KIRK My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame, women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy. 
__label__KIRK Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power. 
__label__KIRK Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite. How do they get their moisture? If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can. 
__label__KIRK You're being unreasonable. 
__label__KIRK Thank you. And thank you for taking care of Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Spock, do you honestly believe that as long as we're in this universe we can work magic too? 
__label__KIRK It's all right. 
__label__KIRK Arrives where? Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter? 
__label__KIRK Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it, if we can. Well, let's not disappoint the chess master. Phasers on full. 
__label__KIRK You won't get it through torture. 
__label__KIRK Position of the intruder, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him. She's doing her job. I think it's about time you started doing yours. We've got to find out the source of his power. You've got a tricorder. Use it if you're able to. 
__label__KIRK No, no, no. Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them? 
__label__KIRK It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to get away. 
__label__KIRK I won't hurt you. 
__label__KIRK Scanners operative on the planet's surface? 
__label__KIRK Then you heard the word of the sun? 
__label__KIRK Backward child, but growing. 
__label__KIRK Blast regulations! Mister Spock, I order you to assume command on my personal authority as Captain of the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Notify Transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party. Then have Doctor McCoy report to me in the Transporter room on the double. 
__label__KIRK There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life. This device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and then provides the necessary grammar. 
__label__KIRK Sensor readings. 
__label__KIRK These are people, not robots. They should have the opportunity of choice. We owe it to them to interfere. 
__label__KIRK Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? 
__label__KIRK All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place. You ought to see it. 
__label__KIRK You say they make the firesticks themselves? How can you be sure?
__label__KIRK Get on it. 
__label__KIRK Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family  SPOCK: No. Nothing of that nature, Captain. 
__label__KIRK He was so young. 
__label__KIRK We need both the matter and the antimatter engines regenerated. 
__label__KIRK We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body. 
__label__KIRK Why, Mister Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles. 
__label__KIRK How did you arrange to touch her, Bones, give her a happy pill? 
__label__KIRK Analysis, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Computer, accuracy scan. 
__label__KIRK Not if we join together to fight you. 
__label__KIRK Scanner readings? 
__label__KIRK Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts. 
__label__KIRK Helm, give us warp speed.
__label__KIRK This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol. 
__label__KIRK Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins? Carstairs is an ensign, no experience. This is his first tour of duty. Rawlins is chief geologist.
__label__KIRK No, I don't see that at all. 
__label__KIRK We heard that you might have rooms for us. 
__label__KIRK He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy? 
__label__KIRK Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to command. I'm losing the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Miri said all the adults died. 
__label__KIRK What kind of biology? 
__label__KIRK And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara. 
__label__KIRK Then some of your makers survive. 
__label__KIRK No, the one inside my head. How long have I  (Tries to sit up and fails.) 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation. 
__label__KIRK You called that skin mottling. 
__label__KIRK Condition Green, all's well. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK If ever there was a time to get out of here, it is now. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, come in. 
__label__KIRK You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to? 
__label__KIRK What about your animals? 
__label__KIRK Right here, it seems. 
__label__KIRK I think he'll cut it.
__label__KIRK You seem to be getting a response. 
__label__KIRK Position.
__label__KIRK I popped in out of thin air. 
__label__KIRK My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered. In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. If the zenite is not delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason. 
__label__KIRK What's so strange about that? 
__label__KIRK When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him. His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines. He could talk only to the ship. Now he can see nothing but the woman.
__label__KIRK Close to Earth conditions. 
__label__KIRK I can't. 
__label__KIRK And you are to be her teacher? 
__label__KIRK Then what was? Winston. 
__label__KIRK You can't just stop the fleet. What gives you the right? 
__label__KIRK (panic stricken) I don't care about the Romulans, I just want to avoid that energy field we passed through before. Helmsman, do you have a fix on it? 
__label__KIRK If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back, we might be able to stop the slaughter. 
__label__KIRK Stand by for check. Scotty, we're still off course. 
__label__KIRK This system's star is a trinary. Limits it a bit, but we're a long way from the Enterprise, if we're in the same dimension. 
__label__KIRK Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk. 
__label__KIRK We need more venom. 
__label__KIRK That ought to do it. 
__label__KIRK How?
__label__KIRK Beam up the security detachment from Triacus. (no one appears)
__label__KIRK You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister  (The man presses a button on his belt, and Kirk, Spock and McCoy are immobilised. The woman does the same to the Yeoman and guard.) 
__label__KIRK Prepared? I was not prepared. Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me in any way. 
__label__KIRK I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now. Is that clear? 
__label__KIRK Type of vessel. Location. 
__label__KIRK If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety.
__label__KIRK What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again. 
__label__KIRK Those old records may hold the key to reversing our mutations.
__label__KIRK You were left alone down here, Ron. What happened? 
__label__KIRK That's what I would have done. 
__label__KIRK Oh. (sitting up) My neck feels like it's been twisted off. 
__label__KIRK On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth, men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy. 
__label__KIRK Hang on, Scotty. Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts. I'll be right down.
__label__KIRK If you kill us, you'll still stay. 
__label__KIRK What do you want from me now? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't want to come in here and use our muscle, you know what I mean? That ain't subtle. So what we do is we help one guy take over the planet. He pulls the strings, and then we pull his. (to Spock) Hey, you, sit down.
__label__KIRK Nothing happened. 
__label__KIRK Spock?
__label__KIRK Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on. 
__label__KIRK I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles. 
__label__KIRK Confirm co-ordinates, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security detail. 
__label__KIRK What happened to your crew? 
__label__KIRK Cancel implementation of General Order Twenty Four. Alert transporter room. We're ready to beam up. 
__label__KIRK Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the assembled personnel to look at Doctor Janice Lester and visualise that historic moment. Can you, can you tell me why Doctor Janice Lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange? 
__label__KIRK Are you? (Spock nods)
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Acknowledge. Acknowledge.
__label__KIRK Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomena. Give me an ETA for its possible impact. 
__label__KIRK Well? 
__label__KIRK It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.
__label__KIRK Trouble? 
__label__KIRK Can you help it? 
__label__KIRK And what will you do? 
__label__KIRK Origin? 
__label__KIRK What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Van Gelder?
__label__KIRK All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly butchered. 
__label__KIRK In other words, it's too good to be true. 
__label__KIRK We will go now. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, I'll find out. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge. 
__label__KIRK What's going on, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship. 
__label__KIRK Somewhere down there is where the Others live. Scotty, see if you can find a way down. 
__label__KIRK They still have power? We still control them? 
__label__KIRK Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look. 
__label__KIRK Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home.
__label__KIRK Beam down two security men. 
__label__KIRK The starship Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty? 
__label__KIRK I created you? 
__label__KIRK Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon. 
__label__KIRK Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him. 
__label__KIRK I saw you on my ship. 
__label__KIRK Sorry. 
__label__KIRK Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney. 
__label__KIRK What was in the bar? 
__label__KIRK Very pretty.
__label__KIRK Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, what's happened to the shields? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, come with me. Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd. 
__label__KIRK Which means our weapons are useless, and we have no alternative but to go back down there and try to rescue Spock without them. 
__label__KIRK Captain's log, supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and reenergised. 
__label__KIRK Give me Spock. 
__label__KIRK Keep trying to contact the Enterprise. Maybe we can distract them. 
__label__KIRK To fight each other, and the Providers gamble on the winner. 
__label__KIRK Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard. 
__label__KIRK Expand search radius. 
__label__KIRK All right. We can't break out. There must be another way. 
__label__KIRK You're fired. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Anything? 
__label__KIRK This is no time for a vendetta. Maintain your post. 
__label__KIRK You butchered helpless human beings GORN [OC]: We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you!
__label__KIRK Yes, I hope so. 
__label__KIRK Of course we blew it up. Deliberately. 
__label__KIRK Try GSK-783, sub-space frequency 3. 
__label__KIRK No, I don't. Won't you tell me? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK We're simply strangers from  NONA: From one of the lights in the sky, and you have ways as far above firesticks as the sky above our world. 
__label__KIRK What are they? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Put it on. 
__label__KIRK Why did the Vedala call this the Mad planet? 
__label__KIRK This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Open it. 
__label__KIRK There's that laugh again. Something awfully familiar about it.
__label__KIRK Where's McCoy? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim.
__label__KIRK Anything? 
__label__KIRK I know.
__label__KIRK Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your administrative area. 
__label__KIRK Fire. 
__label__KIRK You got a better idea? 
__label__KIRK My wife. Is she all right? 
__label__KIRK I thought you lived alone. 
__label__KIRK Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that. 
__label__KIRK Can you calculate the geographic centre of the wave emissions from the planet's surface? 
__label__KIRK It has to hold longer than a bit. 
__label__KIRK Request denied. 
__label__KIRK We come (moves forward and gets pushed back by a weapon) Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace.
__label__KIRK Put him on. 
__label__KIRK Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people down? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately. 
__label__KIRK Our only chance is the intruder control circuit. Although he's cut it off at the Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Full alert. Tricorder readings, Mister Spock. Life detection.
__label__KIRK At another place in time, I think. If we check closely, I believe we'll find many of those ships are the ones designated as lost in the Delta Triangle. 
__label__KIRK He's some kind of colony creature. And take care not to injure any of the natives here. Phasers on lightest possible stun setting. And don't fire unless absolutely necessary. 
__label__KIRK But why would he want to kill only two of us? 
__label__KIRK These are strange aliens we're fighting. Scotty, as soon as we beam down, I want you to leave orbit. If they think we've gone, they won't be scanning the surface. Give us thirty minutes. 
__label__KIRK There it is again. A flapping sound. (it goes dark) Agmar! 
__label__KIRK Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Tell me something. Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us? 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, stand by to beam us back. 
__label__KIRK That's strange. Repeat the call. 
__label__KIRK Well, that settles that. A force field. 
__label__KIRK We missed you, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK He has fled. 
__label__KIRK By now it must be obvious to you that you have been expected. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator.
__label__KIRK Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates? 
__label__KIRK Prepare to destruct. 
__label__KIRK Get with it. I'm giving the orders here. 
__label__KIRK No, you'll live and develop as you should have. All this shouldn't have been done for you. Now the women here below and the men here above will control together. 
__label__KIRK Yes, especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes. Apparently, none of them survived. 
__label__KIRK (helps her out of vent) Helen, are you all right? (kisses her) 
__label__KIRK Take him. 
__label__KIRK It is. We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer the ways of peaceful contact. I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing. We have sought you out to join us. Our mission is still one of peace. 
__label__KIRK Go on, get on with it, Harry. 
__label__KIRK What about sensor failure? 
__label__KIRK Hold position. Analysis, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life. His wife is the only way to reach him. If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe she'll convince him.
__label__KIRK Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks. You hear that, Proconsul? It won't work. I'm not co-operating. I may die, but you won't get any entertainment out of it. 
__label__KIRK Worried about the delivery? 
__label__KIRK He is unharmed. I have taken his body to demonstrate  MCCOY: (drawing his phaser) I won't go along with this. Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are. 
__label__KIRK Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?
__label__KIRK Photon torpedoes. Fire one. 
__label__KIRK Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet. No circumstances what so ever. 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Scotty. Kirk out. Uhura, reduce mayday signals. One per ten minute cycle. Cut down sensor sweeps, Mister Arex. 
__label__KIRK Spock, on board? 
__label__KIRK You're not Andorian. Who are you? 
__label__KIRK What kind of jewels are in this? 
__label__KIRK To build. To build humanoid robots. We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers. 
__label__KIRK Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it. We have a duty to forget what happened. 
__label__KIRK Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a place this beautiful exists. 
__label__KIRK My first officer, Commander Spock. 
__label__KIRK Nomad, come here.
__label__KIRK This hearing is convened. Mister Spock, you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice?
__label__KIRK No one is to move. Spock? Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Quick, your hypo. Full tranquilliser setting. 
__label__KIRK Report, Mister Spock. Spock, report. 
__label__KIRK What about Korob? 
__label__KIRK None whatsoever. Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity.
__label__KIRK I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control? 
__label__KIRK Stabbed, a dozen times. 
__label__KIRK Feed beam down co-ordinates to the transporter room. Mister Sulu, you'll accompany me. Mister Spock, you have the conn. 
__label__KIRK Ready? 
__label__KIRK You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling, hurting, burning. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order. 
__label__KIRK It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs  KORBY: Captain, I'd much prefer  KIRK: Rayburn, are you receiving? 
__label__KIRK Spock, come in. Come in. 
__label__KIRK Am I behaving incorrectly? 
__label__KIRK Report on damage sustained in mock attack. 
__label__KIRK No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?
__label__KIRK What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force? 
__label__KIRK Suit temperatures to seventy two. Life-form readings, Mister Spock? (gets a look) Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Then we're not home yet.
__label__KIRK Isn't it? 
__label__KIRK What do you mean? 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK That's a very good idea, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Sounds most promising. Good luck. 
__label__KIRK Correction, Bones. Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game.
__label__KIRK I had no idea that history was your specialty. 
__label__KIRK We won't harm you. We're friends. 
__label__KIRK No longer. 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Bridge, this is Kirk. Sulu? 
__label__KIRK What do they want from us? 
__label__KIRK You're as bad as she is. It's not required that you like each other. Just do your job. 
__label__KIRK I can't. Power level's dropping too fast.
__label__KIRK Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered? 
__label__KIRK Answer me! 
__label__KIRK Maintain Red Alert. 
__label__KIRK Belay that, Mister Scott. Yes, sir? 
__label__KIRK They tried to brain us with these clubs. Check them out, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Lock phasers on target. Mister Bailey, lock phasers. 
__label__KIRK Because they may not be dead. We have to find out. 
__label__KIRK If we beam down, can you compare our position with his control setting? 
__label__KIRK Bugs the? Well, carry out the standard procedures on Pollux Four.
__label__KIRK If necessary. Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott. 
__label__KIRK This is a day to remember, Major. 
__label__KIRK Warp eight, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Reduce to warp one, Mister Walking Bear. 
__label__KIRK Quickly! 
__label__KIRK It's a suicide mission. 
__label__KIRK We've got four minutes, maybe five.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal with them. 
__label__KIRK You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman Green. General quarters, security condition three. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, if you'd concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already. 
__label__KIRK There are few in the Federation who wouldn't recognise your face, sir. I'm Captain James Kirk, commanding this vessel. Mister Spock, my first officer, Doctor McCoy, senior medical officer. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK I have a crew of four hundred and thirty, Karla Five. Your ship is suitable for only a few people. 
__label__KIRK That seems to frighten you. 
__label__KIRK Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take. 
__label__KIRK I'm sorry, Shahna. (takes the magnetic key and unlocks his door) 
__label__KIRK I was preoccupied. 
__label__KIRK It's very old. Does it have a name? Shahna, could it have been a city for the Providers? 
__label__KIRK We've got to figure this out and devise a defence against it. Is it possible that the rocks have life? 
__label__KIRK Thank you. Kirk to Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Something is shaking us apart. 
__label__KIRK I'm a stranger. 
__label__KIRK Bring some for the doctor, too.
__label__KIRK We'll know that in ten minutes. After that, it won't matter anymore. Prepare to energise. 
__label__KIRK Those people have done you no harm. 
__label__KIRK And tried to destroy Antos Four. SPOCK: Why? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. This is not a zoological expedition. Maintain a constant reading on the creature. If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels. We'll try to surround it. I'm sorry, Mister Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die. 
__label__KIRK Put it on screen. 
__label__KIRK Bones, how did you do it? 
__label__KIRK Interesting. An Arcturian Macbeth. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But where is the source of that power? 
__label__KIRK What we need is more information about Landru. (Reger shakes his head) You said you wanted us to help you. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I see. Scout up the trail that way. See what we have in the way of an exit. I'll take a look around. 
__label__KIRK But you probed our memory banks.
__label__KIRK And you? (clunk as grate closes)
__label__KIRK Just a minute  METRON [OC]: There will be no discussion. It is done. 
__label__KIRK Negative pressure in all ship's vents. Alert all decks. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps.
__label__KIRK Spock, run additional tricorder readings. Learn anything you can.
__label__KIRK Would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and holding them there. 
__label__KIRK I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started the fight? 
__label__KIRK You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane. 
__label__KIRK No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made. 
__label__KIRK I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a similar situation. Steady as we go, helm.  
__label__KIRK Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War. 
__label__KIRK Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body. 
__label__KIRK What is it, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Strange, that's the way I feel about you, too. My dear friend, Spock. Come, let's go get Mudd and Christine. 
__label__KIRK Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer. 
__label__KIRK Annoyed, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Spock, play the last log tape. Maybe they had time to record what happened to them. 
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase Six. Ahead warp factor five. I'm still looking forward to a nice period of rest and relaxation on some lovely (gazes at yeoman) planet.  
__label__KIRK Increase speed to warp eight. 
__label__KIRK I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here. I'm sure that you can appreciate that. 
__label__KIRK Where is it? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves. 
__label__KIRK Are you out of your mind? (grabs Mudd by the throat) You can't beam down an entire crew of a spaceship. Somebody has to be on board. 
__label__KIRK Good. Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the arsenal. Keep them inconspicuous. Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours. Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about. It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times. 
__label__KIRK Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up. 
__label__KIRK Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do. 
__label__KIRK Are you certain of your sensor readings? 
__label__KIRK What is it, Mister Spock? Is it a hand? 
__label__KIRK Speculate. 
__label__KIRK If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves.
__label__KIRK You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you understand the nature of it? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Everyone, including yourself. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him do it. 
__label__KIRK Chekov. Chekov. (picks him up) Is this what's in store for us, from here on in? Violence, hatred. 
__label__KIRK Bones, answer me! Bones, what is it?
__label__KIRK Stand by to fire. Fire. 
__label__KIRK Salud! 
__label__KIRK Certainly. 
__label__KIRK (in pain) I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just hurry, please. 
__label__KIRK Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert. 
__label__KIRK But I am your creator. 
__label__KIRK Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition? 
__label__KIRK Who is it? 
__label__KIRK Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked.
__label__KIRK You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered girl. 
__label__KIRK I'm happy. I'm so happy. If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately. All bridge personnel, report immediately. 
__label__KIRK Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds? 
__label__KIRK We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will. 
__label__KIRK A planet that even Spock can't explain. Prepare to transport.
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too. Our ship has need of us. We have tasks to perform. 
__label__KIRK Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm. Correlate following hypothesis. Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional contact with a parallel universe? 
__label__KIRK No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of three starships. Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital. 
__label__KIRK Range, Mister Chekov? 
__label__KIRK Has the target changed location, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Answers.
__label__KIRK You say you're convinced he knows what it is? 
__label__KIRK Wide scan, Scotty. We'll be moving. Spock, in here. Spock! 
__label__KIRK Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer here at any one time. The other will monitor him on the dispensary screen. 
__label__KIRK I'll see if I can pick up anything on my communicator. This is Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise, calling the crew of the Ariel. Come in please. Come in. 
__label__KIRK We mean you no harm. We're not your enemies, we're your friends.
__label__KIRK Yes, of course. I should've guessed. Congratulations. Tyree, we must talk now. The villagers, their new weapons. I want to hear all about that. We must make plans. 
__label__KIRK Who are you, Sargon? 
__label__KIRK Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas? 
__label__KIRK Sure. We can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice. You know what I mean? He's standing about twelve feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal. 
__label__KIRK Nonsense. 
__label__KIRK Is she all right? 
__label__KIRK Any contact, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Under no circumstances allow them in here yet. The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through. 
__label__KIRK It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do. 
__label__KIRK Landru died six thousand years ago. 
__label__KIRK I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo? 
__label__KIRK Not enough. I have a ship to command. 
__label__KIRK What is your authorisation? From what source? 
__label__KIRK I'll want a complete transcript of everything that happens down there, Yeoman. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain Kirk. This ship is under my command. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up. 
__label__KIRK Mister Scott, start repairs. Install the auxiliary controls. 
__label__KIRK Any time you can bluff me, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Secure from general quarters. 
__label__KIRK He's cut off both helm and power.
__label__KIRK This was not written for chiefs. (general consternation) Hear me!
__label__KIRK But he didn't. And history has made its judgment. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, contact Governor Wesley. Tell him to bring his ships back. 
__label__KIRK Your orders are to stand by. Now, carry them out! Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Dead. But it had you, too. 
__label__KIRK And how will you pay for your acts of murder? 
__label__KIRK Yes, of course. 
__label__KIRK Then cut power. 
__label__KIRK Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice.
__label__KIRK Forward phasers, stand by. (the Romulan becomes a clear image)
__label__KIRK The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives, potential, resources, time. I submit to you that your Empire is illogical because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to be a willing part of it. 
__label__KIRK Decoding? 
__label__KIRK I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister Spock. (to Elaan) I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected part of the ship. 
__label__KIRK One hallucination flattened me with a clout on the jaw. 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK Help him. 
__label__KIRK Put me on ship-wide intercom. 
__label__KIRK Just a little while longer, Scotty. Report on the computer search. 
__label__KIRK They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what? 
__label__KIRK The engineer will need aid from my first officer to complete repairs. Is that permitted? (silence) I guess it is. 
__label__KIRK Correct it after you release control of my ship. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK There are times, Mister Spock, when I think I should have been a librarian. 
__label__KIRK I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas.
__label__KIRK Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment. 
__label__KIRK Do we look like any Romans you ever saw ? 
__label__KIRK Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment. 
__label__KIRK It won't work. 
__label__KIRK Compute new course, Mister Arex. Let's see what's going on. 
__label__KIRK We're not slaves to our starship. We, or men like us, created the Enterprise to carry us through space. 
__label__KIRK Put it on the viewscreen, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Can we take it, Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Your word first. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Your time is running out. This sun is about to nova. When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet, and this insane torture chamber. 
__label__KIRK Drop it! (he fires, Brown falls straight backwards and the big figure bursts in and lifts Kirk off his feet. Chapel screams as she sees the hole in Brown reveals electronic parts)
__label__KIRK Contact medical stores. I want as much haemoplasm as they can spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters.
__label__KIRK Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist? 
__label__KIRK That's an order. Watch him. Captain out. 
__label__KIRK I see. And you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety? 
__label__KIRK Look, Lucien, or whatever you want to call yourself, I want to know why you brought us here. 
__label__KIRK Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy? 
__label__KIRK Fire main phasers.
__label__KIRK Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong? 
__label__KIRK Which is? 
__label__KIRK Let's see them. 
__label__KIRK I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating.
__label__KIRK Larry Marvick? Why? 
__label__KIRK I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me. 
__label__KIRK Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes. 
__label__KIRK Cartographic Detail, stand by. 
__label__KIRK Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our old age. Which won't be for some while, I hope. Take over, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. 
__label__KIRK This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Has the Ambassador been hurt? 
__label__KIRK Final sensor readings? 
__label__KIRK I don't intend to kill you unless I have to. 
__label__KIRK Now listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late. 
__label__KIRK Are you scanning for any unusual movement? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened? 
__label__KIRK Warp factor three, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Twenty three minutes. 
__label__KIRK Let me speak to you! 
__label__KIRK Scotty, we've got six.
__label__KIRK Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Thing destroyed your entire civilisation. 
__label__KIRK Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light. 
__label__KIRK What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference? 
__label__KIRK The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out. We're barely surviving at this distance. 
__label__KIRK We're interested in you, Harry. For fraud, illegal drug manufacture and swindling. 
__label__KIRK Stand by tractor beams. 
__label__KIRK How long? 
__label__KIRK No apparent opening. 
__label__KIRK All right, mister. You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies.
__label__KIRK And if he's lying? 
__label__KIRK Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?
__label__KIRK Who, me, Doctor? 
__label__KIRK (to guards) Gentlemen, I want a picture of you two with the Hero of the Fatherland listening to the stirring Fuhrer's speech. Get that light over there, please. Get this light around here. Smile, gentlemen. Turn around, smile, and now. 
__label__KIRK Something else we'd better determine first. How long can we expect to maintain control of our ship? 
__label__KIRK Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream. 
__label__KIRK Put a guard on him. 
__label__KIRK Take over, Mister Sulu. Thank you, Ambassador. Mister Chekov, plot a new course. 
__label__KIRK You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman.
__label__KIRK Slaves and gladiators. What are we seeing, a twentieth-century Rome? 
__label__KIRK Get back to Engineering. Try to re-establish engine control, and talk to ordnance about manufacturing phaser replacements. 
__label__KIRK Bones, check the prisoner you'll find in security confinement. I want a medical analysis fast. Is he or isn't he human?
__label__KIRK Keep Sulu's attention off that board. 
__label__KIRK Controls are fused. Drop! 
__label__KIRK Report, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Can he control it the way he says, Bones? 
__label__KIRK Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death. 
__label__KIRK What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal?
__label__KIRK I don't know. Green! (Green arrives) Did you see this? 
__label__KIRK I'm not interested in your excuses, Lieutenant. Re-establish contact with that transmitter. 
__label__KIRK Ship to ship.
__label__KIRK Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship? 
__label__KIRK Who are you? 
__label__KIRK Well, of course not. We're here to help. 
__label__KIRK The President and Edith Keeler. 
__label__KIRK We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there. 
__label__KIRK Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. 
__label__KIRK In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than that. 
__label__KIRK You could have a point, Bones. Those ships, the city. The Phylosians built a technology possibly greater than we animal species did. 
__label__KIRK Are you certain? 
__label__KIRK The danger to you is Korby. 
__label__KIRK Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice? 
__label__KIRK What about the other systems? 
__label__KIRK Malfunction, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my crew. Are they dead? 
__label__KIRK Trelane, we haven't planned  TRELANE: Tut tut. Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem. Quite the contrary. I have nothing but admiration for your whole species. 
__label__KIRK Very beautiful, much like Earth. 
__label__KIRK (looking at a car advert) The Jupiter Eight. Conventional internal combustion engine. You were right about the smog. But the Jupiter Eight?
__label__KIRK That would explain why there are no adults. 
__label__KIRK Neither do the pods. Communications are dead. Building overload.
__label__KIRK Mister Cochrane. We were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn't identify. 
__label__KIRK We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean, drama about to unfold? 
__label__KIRK Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship! 
__label__KIRK You keep the dilithium shipment, no mention of the whole incident to Starfleet or in my log, plus and additional galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the drug. 
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK If that structure is the source of his power, I want to know where he is when we attack it. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? (he takes a walk around then) Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the bridge? 
__label__KIRK Bones, Spock. since you are playing this tape, we will assume that I am dead, that the tactical situation is critical, and both of you are locked in mortal combat. It means, Spock, that you have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career. I can offer only one small piece of advice, for whatever it's worth. Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship. But temper your judgment with intuitive insight.
__label__KIRK Are you going to help us find it? 
__label__KIRK You must create the good. That is the will of Landru, nothing else. 
__label__KIRK Shore leave? 
__label__KIRK Chekov, arm photon torpedoes. 
__label__KIRK By what, Spock? 
__label__KIRK I think we know that man. 
__label__KIRK Am I disturbing you? 
__label__KIRK Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand? 
__label__KIRK But you are afraid. 
__label__KIRK Good. No problems between you? 
__label__KIRK Hey, Bela, no, no, no. The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this. No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss. Krako, you'd be his lieutenant. The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation. We'll be back every year to collect our cut. 
__label__KIRK I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in.
__label__KIRK Enterprise. Enterprise, can you hear me? 
__label__KIRK What's so fascinating?
__label__KIRK All right, Spock. Get at it. 
__label__KIRK The Archons. Tell me about them. 
__label__KIRK No. No, it might require amassed phasers. 
__label__KIRK Situation, Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK (grabbing him by the neck) I said, give me the brandy! (leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters) 
__label__KIRK My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate. 
__label__KIRK Another technical journal, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Where is everyone? 
__label__KIRK Engineering deck, Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor. You'll prepare for direct transfer of equipment. 
__label__KIRK A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?
__label__KIRK She said something else, words that didn't make sense. 
__label__KIRK How come we always end up like this? 
__label__KIRK Did it work? 
__label__KIRK He will not stay. (He makes Spock release her, and grabs her himself, taking off her bracelet.) Now, you took his brain. You will put it back. How did you do it? 
__label__KIRK Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er  EVE: They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness. 
__label__KIRK These Providers of yours, are they  GALT: Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs. 
__label__KIRK Blow out the bulkheads if you have to. We need numbers. What kind of luck have you had controlling the ship's speed? 
__label__KIRK Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused. The guilt. 
__label__KIRK  You brought me here to learn this? Does she know? 
__label__KIRK I can't. I'm sorry. Our power is balanced for four. There's no guarantee that we'll make it with five. All could die. Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Oh, no. I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you.
__label__KIRK All right. (takes the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Why not? 
__label__KIRK The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question. 
__label__KIRK Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder. 
__label__KIRK Auxiliary control to Doctor McCoy. Bones, are you all right? 
__label__KIRK What? What? What's quadrotriticale? (Lurry hands him a small packet) Wheat. So what? 
__label__KIRK Human. 
__label__KIRK Who caught you? 
__label__KIRK You know my name?
__label__KIRK Execute. 
__label__KIRK Yet one of them accomplished it. 
__label__KIRK What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a Thasian? 
__label__KIRK I was afraid of that. Once out of our sight, he can become anyone or anything aboard this ship. 
__label__KIRK That helmet covers a multitude of sins. 
__label__KIRK You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough. 
__label__KIRK Lazarus! You stay here. All personnel, security red. 
__label__KIRK Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Then, Mister Spock, comply. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet. 
__label__KIRK Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter? 
__label__KIRK Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars. 
__label__KIRK Can you decode it? 
__label__KIRK I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far as I could tell, she was being attacked. 
__label__KIRK Prepare the arrest report, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Now what? 
__label__KIRK Watch out. We know their development is primitive. 
__label__KIRK Mine is Jim Kirk. His is Spock. 
__label__KIRK Do what you can for him, Doctor. 
__label__KIRK Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's boring. Adjusting the translator will give you something to do. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Certainly. 
__label__KIRK Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in. 
__label__KIRK Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced such a race of beings? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news? 
__label__KIRK Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to become fully conscious she'll know what has happened. 
__label__KIRK You're running a big risk, Spock. 
__label__KIRK We're less cold-blooded about it than you are. 
__label__KIRK Let's find out where we stand. Computer. 
__label__KIRK Then I'll talk to Lady Macbeth. 
__label__KIRK And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors. 
__label__KIRK Yes. I think so. 
__label__KIRK You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you. 
__label__KIRK Don't you ever relax? 
__label__KIRK Fire! 
__label__KIRK Harry, Harry, you'll never get away with it. 
__label__KIRK We could put you in suspended animation until we determine what to do with you. 
__label__KIRK All right, Scotty. I'll handle it down here.
__label__KIRK Tribbles. 
__label__KIRK Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several days old. They seldom stay in one place. 
__label__KIRK We've got it. 
__label__KIRK I see. All right, Lieutenant. Monitor all frequencies. Phaser crews stand by. Maintain Yellow Alert.
__label__KIRK All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down here. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end. Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing ever is. Ready, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK We've got to communicate with them. 
__label__KIRK The electric eye. We've grown too small to make it work. 
__label__KIRK Did you get up into space? 
__label__KIRK Try ship to ship. 
__label__KIRK Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years after that. 
__label__KIRK You're very welcome, Mister Spock. But no human can look at Kollos, even with a visor, without going mad. How do you manage? 
__label__KIRK Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time. 
__label__KIRK He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you volunteered to go. What is that thing out there, Bones? It's not intelligent. Not yet. 
__label__KIRK Lay in a course for Argona Two, Navigator.
__label__KIRK Later, later, later. Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Mister Scott.
__label__KIRK Scotty, throw the switch on that device. 
__label__KIRK Yes, but later. Let's not spoil their fun just yet. 
__label__KIRK Then go to Red Alert. 
__label__KIRK If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed. 
__label__KIRK Was he trying to kill himself?
__label__KIRK Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died? 
__label__KIRK Barrows, give me a report.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott beam us up. 
__label__KIRK One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place where we can care for her. 
__label__KIRK You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life. 
__label__KIRK Did Outpost 4 give anything at all on the attacking vessel, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their weapon. SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the intruder. 
__label__KIRK What about us, Charlie? 
__label__KIRK Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for dikironium in the atmosphere. Set your phasers on disrupter-B. If you see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately. You're on Red Alert. Make a sweep. 
__label__KIRK Kang. (switches off intercom) He won't answer. 
__label__KIRK Don't you get tired of these games? 
__label__KIRK Transporter room, ready to beam up. 
__label__KIRK How about it, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success. 
__label__KIRK I'll take over, Mister Spock. You report to Sickbay with Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK 14A. (a diagram of our solar system comes up on a screen) Nomad, can you scan that? 
__label__KIRK It does have advantages over chess. 
__label__KIRK Go to GQ four. 
__label__KIRK Volcanic activity? 
__label__KIRK Chekov, take over Spock's scanners. 
__label__KIRK Whoever you are, you've proven your skill at creating illusion.
__label__KIRK Superstition. 
__label__KIRK Enterprise. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Lock into orbit. 
__label__KIRK But so will yours. 
__label__KIRK I can't accept that, Bones. We've got fourteen science labs aboard this ship. The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy. 
__label__KIRK There's your murder charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It's killing men and women. Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women! 
__label__KIRK I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen. I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it. I want another answer. I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me. I want that third alternative. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, set the controls for deep space. Two ten, mark one. 
__label__KIRK Yes. 
__label__KIRK Start immediate evacuation of all colonists to the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you see what's going on? 
__label__KIRK Find something? 
__label__KIRK Always to the same place? 
__label__KIRK Can we break out of orbit if we have to? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Not if we used all of the power pack's energy for one high speed run. 
__label__KIRK Do you like what you see? Absolute power corrupting absolutely.
__label__KIRK I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead.
__label__KIRK That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK What was that? 
__label__KIRK You can't escape the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK How's it going? 
__label__KIRK Get up here on the double.
__label__KIRK What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust? 
__label__KIRK It's all right. 
__label__KIRK Put the ship on Red Alert. How fast is it travelling, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight? 
__label__KIRK You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy. 
__label__KIRK That's a powerful signal to reach here from that great a distance. 
__label__KIRK The virus you need is very rare. Who will provide it? 
__label__KIRK I can afford even less to lose the Enterprise. Open the hailing frequency again, Lieutenant. Captain Koloth. I'm going to give you one last chance to release the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK There's so much you must learn here first. The Providers will teach you. Learn it, Shahna. all your people must learn before you can reach for the stars. Shahna. (he gives her a farewell kiss) Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Consider it a challenge. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, take us back to the space station. Ahead, warp factor two.  
__label__KIRK Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows. Front and centre.
__label__KIRK Stand by to beam up landing party. 
__label__KIRK Scotty, set automatic return for me. If there's anything to be found down there, ten minutes should do it. 
__label__KIRK Well, well, well. It is our worship word, too. 
__label__KIRK Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Where do you come from? 
__label__KIRK I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died. All right. All right.
__label__KIRK (with a large metal bar in his hand)
__label__KIRK Detail, fan out. What is this thing, Mister Spock? It seems to be pulsating with power of some kind. Analysis, please. 
__label__KIRK The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes visible. End run, gentlemen. We'll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment. 
__label__KIRK Good. I like yours, too. I like you. 
__label__KIRK If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations. 
__label__KIRK We're tired of your phony fireworks! 
__label__KIRK Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness. One of the last of our prejudices. At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty. (they stand for the toast) To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship. 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Try to warn him. If he loses power now  FARRELL: There go his engines, sir. 
__label__KIRK report to Mister Spock for assignment.
__label__KIRK And very brief. 
__label__KIRK Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this. 
__label__KIRK I like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining  SCOTT: Come along. 
__label__KIRK From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light.
__label__KIRK Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go? 
__label__KIRK We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here. 
__label__KIRK Put it on audio. 
__label__KIRK Who is this, the Metron?
__label__KIRK Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus colony.
__label__KIRK At the moment, I seem to have no choice. 
__label__KIRK This is Spock. You saw him on the ship. You have his brain. It must be restored to him immediately. What have you done with it? 
__label__KIRK My brother's son? 
__label__KIRK He failed a psycho-simulator test. All it takes is a split second of indecision. Hardly the type to become a political strongman. 
__label__KIRK Open a channel, Uhura. 
__label__KIRK No, that won't be necessary. I'll come by later for that examination. Let's go, Spock. 
__label__KIRK What is it?
__label__KIRK Sulu? 
__label__KIRK It's only the wind and the thunder. 
__label__KIRK He's a Vulcan. They don't react like humans.  MCCOY: He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance he'll live. 
__label__KIRK The Joining day? 
__label__KIRK You show emotion, Spock. 
__label__KIRK Nomad? Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems. 
__label__KIRK It was a foolish mistake. 
__label__KIRK But does she want to? She's been in there so long. 
__label__KIRK You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack. 
__label__KIRK You have fifteen minutes, Scotty.
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Out of range.
__label__KIRK We can't arrest you, Harry, but you can give yourself up. 
__label__KIRK But obviously no more consideration. 
__label__KIRK Stand by, phasers. Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight. 
__label__KIRK We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist. 
__label__KIRK We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova? 
__label__KIRK Bones, what do you make of that? 
__label__KIRK You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot, every opening. You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. Phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this. Fifty people have died. I want no more deaths. 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Are you all right? 
__label__KIRK Do you post sentries? Guards? 
__label__KIRK Bones, can you do something? 
__label__KIRK In search of his brain, Doctor. From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him. 
__label__KIRK The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's clear. 
__label__KIRK Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint. 
__label__KIRK Yes, we have to control our emotional reactions. 
__label__KIRK Easy. Bones? 
__label__KIRK Say again. 
__label__KIRK You'll never get off the ship.
__label__KIRK May I see it?
__label__KIRK Tormolen's record?
__label__KIRK What's on your mind? 
__label__KIRK As her husband? 
__label__KIRK It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to Vanna. 
__label__KIRK Can you neutralise the gas? 
__label__KIRK Klingon battle cruiser. Deflector shields up, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Commander Bem, you were assigned to this ship as an independent observer, yet you have spent the past six missions in your quarters.
__label__KIRK We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out.
__label__KIRK Stand-by alert. 
__label__KIRK Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know. 
__label__KIRK Surely you don't believe  JUDGE: You heard these spirits? 
__label__KIRK We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand? 
__label__KIRK I agree. What in your opinion does direct them? 
__label__KIRK That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen.
__label__KIRK I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your theories, your quaint philosophies.
__label__KIRK Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty.
__label__KIRK You'll have to stand trial. But you did save the Enterprise from the Romulans, and I will recommend that be taken into consideration. 
__label__KIRK We received a subspace message asking us to divert here immediately.
__label__KIRK No point in repeating that it's illogical, Spock. I'm quite aware of it. 
__label__KIRK Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment. 
__label__KIRK Back to his old course. 
__label__KIRK The children! (all dash out, while Jahn sneaks in and collects the communicators from the desks)
__label__KIRK Bones. Bones. 
__label__KIRK Strange. 
__label__KIRK You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? 
__label__KIRK Like a spider spins his web. 
__label__KIRK And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong.
__label__KIRK Anything? 
__label__KIRK How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right  AYELBORNE: To wage war, Captain? To kill millions of innocent people?
__label__KIRK Out of control. Put it on manual. Bridge. 
__label__KIRK Then why do it if you don't want to? 
__label__KIRK What makes you think you can interfere with  METRON [OC]: It is you who are interfering. We are simply putting a stop to it. The place we have prepared for you contains sufficient elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other, which seems to be your intention. The winner of the contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed. The loser, along with his ship, shall be destroyed in the interests of peace. The contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity, brute strength against brute strength. The results will be final. 
__label__KIRK Meet Kol-Tai, Mister Scott. A friend of Doctor McCoy's. 
__label__KIRK And the computer controls the ship. 
__label__KIRK Oh, it exists, illegally. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK How is she, Doc? 
__label__KIRK Doesn't give us much choice, does it. 
__label__KIRK Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock.
__label__KIRK You require? Who and what are we? 
__label__KIRK I don't think we're going to have any choice. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Computer, accuracy scan. 
__label__KIRK You are programmed to serve. If we're not allowed access to our medical equipment, Harry Mudd will die. He will cease to function. You will have failed to serve. 
__label__KIRK I'm a little pleased myself. Situation? 
__label__KIRK A show of strength. 
__label__KIRK Captain Kirk. 
__label__KIRK Isn't there any way we can help them? 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet security team? 
__label__KIRK Perhaps you can, Mister  ATOZ: Mister Atoz. I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you. I had thought that everyone had long since gone.
__label__KIRK That's the primitive glaciated planet. 
__label__KIRK Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your woman away from you. You're jealous! You tried to kill me with your bare hands. Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting with the emotions of a human. You are a human. 
__label__KIRK We don't want any trouble. We'll be glad to co-operate. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump. 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)
__label__KIRK Kirk here.
__label__KIRK We'll have to wait until nightfall. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm. Explain. 
__label__KIRK Scotty! 
__label__KIRK Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous novelist will write a classic using that theme. He'll recommend those three words even over I love you. 
__label__KIRK I know. Almost impossible. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's right. We're from the valley. 
__label__KIRK One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in places like this. I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman. 
__label__KIRK Cross your fingers. Kirk out. Death, destruction, disease, horror. That's what war is all about, Anan. That's what makes it a thing to be avoided. You've made it neat and painless. So neat and painless, you've had no reason to stop it. And you've had it for five hundred years. Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and my ship, I'm going to end it for you, one way or another. Mister Ambassador. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Sulu. Report. 
__label__KIRK Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. 
__label__KIRK It's too late for that. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about? 
__label__KIRK Logical, as always, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK You've killed thousands of her children. 
__label__KIRK Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any bigotry in your quarters. There's no room for it on the Bridge. Do I make myself clear? 
__label__KIRK The situation is not immediately dangerous. Have the volunteers stand by. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK And if we do stop, we'll be drawn into one of the villi and the ship will explode. 
__label__KIRK You're wrong. It hasn't begun. 
__label__KIRK Which you sold to a thousand inhabitants, who immediately became ill from using it. 
__label__KIRK No! Stay here. All right, Scotty. Turn it off. 
__label__KIRK Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs. Tell them, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Spock, are you slumping? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Yeoman. That's sufficient.
__label__KIRK Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen. 
__label__KIRK Specify. 
__label__KIRK Go ahead. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself. 
__label__KIRK All engines stop.
__label__KIRK You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled. Many lives were lost. 
__label__KIRK Sensor readings? 
__label__KIRK Spock, have you seen anything like that before? 
__label__KIRK Survivors?
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK Who's this?
__label__KIRK Whose? 
__label__KIRK Plot co-ordinates for orbit. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished. Interment will take place on Benecia.
__label__KIRK Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK No? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with some questions.
__label__KIRK That should be enough time. Let's get at it. 
__label__KIRK Gravitation on automatic. (consoles blow up) Emergency stations.
__label__KIRK What? 
__label__KIRK Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.
__label__KIRK What do you want? What are you doing here? 
__label__KIRK My phaser didn't cut through it. 
__label__KIRK Space Station K7, this is Captain Kirk of the Enterprise. What is your emergency? 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones.
__label__KIRK Get to the point. 
__label__KIRK Lock in on McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do. 
__label__KIRK What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise, that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised but only dreamed! The highest reality. 
__label__KIRK Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.
__label__KIRK I think I see  (But a volcanic eruption knocks him off his feet and he drops the communicator. It gets hit with a globule of lava. Kirk runs for it, dodging lava flows until he finds a miniature city. Then he is caught in a transporter beam) 
__label__KIRK A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda? You're young, attractive and human. Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself, someone who isn't ugly. 
__label__KIRK The masks can change that. 
__label__KIRK Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this. 
__label__KIRK I appreciate that. 
__label__KIRK Spock, what did you perceive? 
__label__KIRK You heard the man, Mister Scott. 
__label__KIRK Who do you think I am? 
__label__KIRK (pacing) Vulcan mind techniques. They seem so untrustworthy now that Spock's life is at stake. 
__label__KIRK Standby to activate warp drive unit. 
__label__KIRK Speed, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary? 
__label__KIRK What if it turns out you're an invading alien from the future? 
__label__KIRK Thank you, Doctor. (the lights come back on) Report, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Quite a festival they had. 
__label__KIRK Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy. In fact, they couldn't have been taken for anything else. 
__label__KIRK Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier? 
__label__KIRK Lock in and energise. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to you. 
__label__KIRK Of course. Perhaps I'll see  SPOCK: I'll escort you to your quarters. 
__label__KIRK An android. 
__label__KIRK And what is that word? 
__label__KIRK Computer, identify verification. 
__label__KIRK Random sentences strung together. 
__label__KIRK According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a humanoid. 
__label__KIRK Nothing yet, Ambassador. We're awaiting a reply. Today's the first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal. 
__label__KIRK They are both stubborn. 
__label__KIRK We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only circumstantial. 
__label__KIRK Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities  MARLENA: You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher. 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do there. 
__label__KIRK It's still no deal. 
__label__KIRK What about Miri? 
__label__KIRK Report, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of inhabitants there. 
__label__KIRK Careless of me, Mister Spock. Planetary life forms? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway. Conserve power as much as possible. Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive. Poor Matt. He gave his life in an attempt to save others. Not the worst way to go. 
__label__KIRK Don't say any more. 
__label__KIRK Yes. This utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secret in the galaxy. Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit.
__label__KIRK Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am? 
__label__KIRK Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone? 
__label__KIRK As far as I know. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant. Lieutenant. 
__label__KIRK Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that? 
__label__KIRK How near is Mantilles, Mister Arex? 
__label__KIRK Mister Sulu, did you experience any strange occurrences? 
__label__KIRK Go ahead, Doctor. Put the Teacher on. 
__label__KIRK Fantastic architecture. Only an incredibly advanced race could have built it. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK What happened? 
__label__KIRK How do you know? 
__label__KIRK The damage he'd caused was considerable, but not irreparable. With luck, I would be able to effect repairs before our orbit decayed completely. 
__label__KIRK Did you see your father today? 
__label__KIRK What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock? 
__label__KIRK Okay, stand by. 
__label__KIRK What are you doing on my ship? 
__label__KIRK An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet. This planet is uninhabited, Mister Spock, to the best of our information? 
__label__KIRK Starfleet force is used only as a last resort. We're an instrument of civilisation. And it's a better opportunity for a scientist to study the universe than he can get at the Vulcan Science Academy. 
__label__KIRK Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, you misunderstand us. We can be against him and admire him all at the same time. 
__label__KIRK These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger with each passing day. However, the dreams return every night.
__label__KIRK What about that, Spock? Is it possible? 
__label__KIRK The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long to wait now. 
__label__KIRK What do you propose? 
__label__KIRK Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills. 
__label__KIRK You could go. We're willing to take passengers. 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, what can we expect to find on Lactra Seven? 
__label__KIRK Excuse me. Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK The planet is dead. There's no possibility of life there as we understand life. 
__label__KIRK Aren't you worried about him? 
__label__KIRK Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them down. And mark the incident closed. 
__label__KIRK Sulu, are we still on the same co-ordinates? 
__label__KIRK Both these outposts and this vessel will be considered expendable. Captain out. 
__label__KIRK That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything. 
__label__KIRK You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up. Did you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease, and they became like, Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has.
__label__KIRK How's it going down there, Mister Sulu? 
__label__KIRK I wish to apologise. 
__label__KIRK He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research station. 
__label__KIRK I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of reception you're going to receive. Your safety is my responsibility.
__label__KIRK What do you intend to do with us? 
__label__KIRK Never mind, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Mister DePaul. 
__label__KIRK Young lady. Young lady. 
__label__KIRK All right, Compton. 
__label__KIRK Then we can leave any time we want to. Tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become a fountain of youth.
__label__KIRK I know. 
__label__KIRK Bones? 
__label__KIRK Why did you do it? 
__label__KIRK Now. 
__label__KIRK Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock. I propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the Iotians into a more ethical system. Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities. Isn't that logical?
__label__KIRK Yes, logical. That's what it is. And that in turn gives us a weapon that we can use against them. We must use wild, insane, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman! 
__label__KIRK Hard over, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK Miranda, don't. 
__label__KIRK Even if we could, it's out of the question. We need that projector to bring our people back to human form. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK Quote. All research personnel on alien planets are required to have their health certified by a starship surgeon at one year intervals. Like it or not, Professor, as commander of the starship, I'm required  CRATER: To show your gold braid to everyone. You love it, don't you. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command. Tell them we have a prisoner. 
__label__KIRK The Enterprise is waiting, Mister Cochrane. 
__label__KIRK Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship. We've showed our good faith. Now you show yours. I want this ship released immediately. 
__label__KIRK Daystrom! 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley. 
__label__KIRK Steadying on course marked in red. 
__label__KIRK You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth. 
__label__KIRK I see. 
__label__KIRK Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be watched. We're moving out. Formation L. 
__label__KIRK Have Doctor McCoy beam down immediately. 
__label__KIRK That's how my arm got hurt. 
__label__KIRK Goodbye, Harry. Have fun. 
__label__KIRK Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just pointed out how illogical this situation is. 
__label__KIRK What is it? 
__label__KIRK Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings? 
__label__KIRK All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions and I'll let you up. 
__label__KIRK Specify. 
__label__KIRK Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god needs compassion. Mitchell! Elizabeth. 
__label__KIRK Can you get to the library? 
__label__KIRK Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your response? 
__label__KIRK We're free people. We belong to no one. 
__label__KIRK Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless. 
__label__KIRK Is she all right? 
__label__KIRK Bones, can you remember anything that might help us? Anything at all? 
__label__KIRK We are going to Ariannus. The lives of a billion people make no other choice possible. 
__label__KIRK That's my decision, Doctor.
__label__KIRK Yes, certainly. I'll take you. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to security. Post a guard on the children. They're to be kept under constant watch.
__label__KIRK What do you mean, if both survive? 
__label__KIRK We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach without being seen. 
__label__KIRK But no soul. 
__label__KIRK And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to Doctor McCoy. 
__label__KIRK Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command. 
__label__KIRK All right. I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes. I'll meet you in Sickbay afterward. 
__label__KIRK Yes. Why? 
__label__KIRK Let's go, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK I wish I knew. Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock? 
__label__KIRK How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before? 
__label__KIRK You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of command chair) 
__label__KIRK (looks at monitor) You? Spinoza? 
__label__KIRK So help me, if you don't tell me where Spock has been taken  OTHERS: The Master. Praise to the Master. The Master, our Saviour.
__label__KIRK Now you're sounding like Spock. 
__label__KIRK That's funny. 
__label__KIRK Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception. The Federation will provide anything you need. 
__label__KIRK Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner. The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged. This will be your final battlefield. Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will have been wasted. 
__label__KIRK We must get her into the pressure chamber. 
__label__KIRK It's important, Rila. Not just for us. The population of another planet is threatened by surface changes, too. Argo's ancient knowledge can help save them. 
__label__KIRK On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us. 
__label__KIRK That should make a good specimen. 
__label__KIRK No survivors, no bodies either. 
__label__KIRK I didn't come to drink. 
__label__KIRK Which is physically impossible for one man. 
__label__KIRK Not if he cloned a new copy of himself every so often to carry on the search. Remember, he said he was Keniclius Five. 
__label__KIRK Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK What happened here? Where is everybody? 
__label__KIRK We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves. 
__label__KIRK Scotty. 
__label__KIRK Good. Let's see how long he can do it. 
__label__KIRK Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your problem to the Federation. Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization. 
__label__KIRK The man making it is Doctor Roger Korby. 
__label__KIRK I want those phasers and communicators now. 
__label__KIRK Bones. 
__label__KIRK How much time before the youngest crew member returns to the time of birth? 
__label__KIRK An oversight? 
__label__KIRK Spock? 
__label__KIRK Your figures are specific and absolutely correct, of course?
__label__KIRK Mister Scott? 
__label__KIRK Bridge reports. 
__label__KIRK Yes, you presume correctly. 
__label__KIRK Put them in the hut. Find out where the women are. Put them in there, too. 
__label__KIRK This way. 
__label__KIRK This hearing is now in session. Under the authority vested in me by Starfleet Command, I declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped. 
__label__KIRK Ayelborne! 
__label__KIRK Have you ever seen anything like that, Spock? 
__label__KIRK Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. How are they holding out, Scotty? 
__label__KIRK Scotty, energise. 
__label__KIRK Can you do anything for her? 
__label__KIRK I didn't have much of a chance to thank him. 
__label__KIRK Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect? 
__label__KIRK We have no intention of causing harm. 
__label__KIRK Get him back to the Sickbay. Use security restraints. 
__label__KIRK Where are they? 
__label__KIRK Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you. 
__label__KIRK Look, every pod, they've all been burst open. 
__label__KIRK No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain. You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us. 
__label__KIRK Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us. 
__label__KIRK Computer don't kill a half million people. 
__label__KIRK Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions. 
__label__KIRK Kirk here. 
__label__KIRK I see. Bones, were you thinking about that book? 
__label__KIRK We want the inner one, Ekos. Plot a standard orbit, Mister Chekov, and take us in. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain. 
__label__KIRK Very well, Mister Scott. Kirk out. 
__label__KIRK Any change? 
__label__KIRK James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of Janice Lester. The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission, on the course set before I took over command. Now the years I spent studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested.
__label__KIRK Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price. 
__label__KIRK Who? 
__label__KIRK This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical officer. Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist. 
__label__KIRK You need my approval? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores? 
__label__KIRK You have to remember, for you and your mother to live. 
__label__KIRK Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir. 
__label__KIRK You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?
__label__KIRK Thank you, Mister Spock. (into communicator) Scotty, you can mark this vein as confirmed. Inform Starfleet I recommend that they dispatch a survey vessel immediately. 
__label__KIRK Stand by on alert status, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him  MCCOY: In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will.
__label__KIRK Make your point. 
__label__KIRK The blast, yes. 
__label__KIRK Cestus Three has been destroyed.
__label__KIRK Navigation? 
__label__KIRK Why should we walk right into your hands? 
__label__KIRK Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting better. 
__label__KIRK And what do you think they felt? 
__label__KIRK Good. 
__label__KIRK (on floor) He's right, Spock. You must shoot, but shoot both of us. It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one colour. No key to where the pieces fit in. Why? 
__label__KIRK A hundred serpents. Serpents for the Garden of Eden. We're very tired, Mister Spock. Beam us up home. 
__label__KIRK Bones! Get back to your positions. 
__label__KIRK Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam? 
__label__KIRK Ben. Why kill innocent people? 
__label__KIRK We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary. 
__label__KIRK And the little ones. What's going to happen to them after you've gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? Oh, they'll still be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten it. Maybe six months left, that's all, and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll die, too. 
__label__KIRK And since then two expeditions have failed to find him. 
__label__KIRK No, he's in Sickbay. Doctor McCoy is running a check on the landing party. What is it, Lieutenant? 
__label__KIRK It takes a while for its effects to be noticed. 
__label__KIRK Spock, could I ask for some figures? 
__label__KIRK And how much time did you say we have to investigate? 
__label__KIRK Good.
__label__KIRK Take all action necessary to protect the ship. We'll hold out here. 
__label__KIRK This is Doctor McCoy, our Chief Medical Officer. Daras, secretary to the National Socialist Party. 
__label__KIRK Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s. 
__label__KIRK What was it? 
__label__KIRK How long will the power hold out? 
__label__KIRK But there are other bosses, other territories? 
__label__KIRK Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger? 
__label__KIRK A more important question, gentlemen, is whether or not there's a way out of here. A force field. It seems harmless enough. 
__label__KIRK I'd like to talk to you.
__label__KIRK What was it? 
__label__KIRK I guess they can take it faster than we give it. 
__label__KIRK No. But we would welcome friends. 
__label__KIRK Learning to protect ourselves, Lucien. 
__label__KIRK What are you complaining about? It kept you alive. 
__label__KIRK I'm telling you now. 
__label__KIRK Bridge to Sickbay. Casualty report. 
__label__KIRK Bones, you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit. Give me one. 
__label__KIRK Top priority. 
__label__KIRK All right, Winston. You can come out now. I suggest you show yourself, Winston, or whatever you are. 
__label__KIRK You talk about creating life with your clones, but you have to murder to do it. (picks up Spock) Come on. 
__label__KIRK It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius. 
__label__KIRK It's Tom Leighton. He's dead. 
__label__KIRK I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise.
__label__KIRK Doctor.
__label__KIRK Anything else? 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Report. 
__label__KIRK Korob and Sylvia as they really are. Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else. Only the power pack gave them reality. 
__label__KIRK Cease fire. 
__label__KIRK No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov. 
__label__KIRK But not an exact match, Mister Spock. We're dealing with a man's life. No machine can make that decision. 
__label__KIRK (with chair) I'm your Captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot!
__label__KIRK Take it easy, Bones. 
__label__KIRK Any luck? 
__label__KIRK Go to your quarters. 
__label__KIRK We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's going on. 
__label__KIRK I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Why? 
__label__KIRK Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK How have you been? 
__label__KIRK We're under attack. I have to go to the Bridge. I've got to go to the bridge. 
__label__KIRK Spock, how do you read that? 
__label__KIRK Peculiar stuff to find in paradise. 
__label__KIRK Doesn't seem likely, does it? 
__label__KIRK Just have those crystals here when I get back.
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, try and warn them of  UHURA: I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference. 
__label__KIRK Let's get out of here. 
__label__KIRK Nomad. Nomad? Stop. Nomad, stop! Nomad. 
__label__KIRK Better do what they want for now, anyway. They activated another force field. 
__label__KIRK Yes, I know.
__label__KIRK What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time? 
__label__KIRK Doctor, is there something I can do for you? 
__label__KIRK This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.
__label__KIRK Research is not the Klingon way. 
__label__KIRK You mean you brought us here? 
__label__KIRK The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can help it. M-5, tie-in. 
__label__KIRK Total senility? 
__label__KIRK Cut that thing off. 
__label__KIRK Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over and out. Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK Yet you can kill a young girl. 
__label__KIRK Three against one? Those are pretty high odds. 
__label__KIRK Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where is she? 
__label__KIRK Read out, Mister Spock. 
__label__KIRK Such as? 
__label__KIRK Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our action.  
__label__KIRK You'd think they had people beaming down every day. 
__label__KIRK Yes, Mister Sulu.
__label__KIRK Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier. 
__label__KIRK Normal orbit approach procedures, Mister Sulu. 
__label__KIRK No. 
__label__KIRK No, I'm not. Now listen to me! Hear me out. When your ancestors discovered that their world was dying they built a great ship and chose their best people. They wished for their race to survive. They sent the ship out into space. 
__label__KIRK No! 
__label__KIRK I have the distinct feeling this planet's playing cat and mouse with us, but for what reason? 
__label__KIRK The Colonel is drunk. He's had a little too much to drink. 
__label__KIRK Why?
__label__KIRK Mousetrapped. If the first ship doesn't succeed in blasting us out of existence, they have two backup ships to do the job. 
__label__KIRK From Ekos? 
__label__KIRK Kirk to bridge. 
__label__KIRK Kirk to Enterprise. 
__label__KIRK You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister. 
__label__KIRK He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by. 
__label__KIRK Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off? 
__label__KIRK Why, Gill? Why? 
__label__KIRK Fizzbin. It's not too difficult. (begins dealing) Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven. 
__label__KIRK Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers. Does that give you any choice? 
__label__KIRK Energise. 
__label__KIRK I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are. 
__label__KIRK I don't understand. 
__label__KIRK Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel. 
__label__SPOCK Right, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Including, I would hope, some of that monotonous, old dispensing of the regular vitamin rations to the crew. 
__label__SPOCK (spotting shelves of discs) Captain. Intelligence files. Their banks contain the total knowledge of the Fabrini, ready for the people to consult when they arrive at their destination. (scans them) And they seem to have amassed a great deal of medical knowledge.
__label__SPOCK It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK (looking about the same as usual) Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time. 
__label__SPOCK Small change occurring there, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Thirty seconds is very slim timing. 
__label__SPOCK I'm doing that, Captain, as per your previous order. We discussed that earlier. 
__label__SPOCK You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5 circuits. 
__label__SPOCK To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission. 
__label__SPOCK Quite correct. 
__label__SPOCK This is Mister Spock. 
__label__SPOCK You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel. 
__label__SPOCK It is true then, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.
__label__SPOCK The fifth setting seems to be an energy absorber. Fascinating. I had no idea the Slavers had such things. 
__label__SPOCK We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future?
__label__SPOCK Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through there to be used as a duodynetic field core...
__label__SPOCK Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction. 
__label__SPOCK Complete Earth parallel. The language here is English. 
__label__SPOCK I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before. 
__label__SPOCK I was speaking of a legend, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it.
__label__SPOCK Commodore? 
__label__SPOCK Bridge acknowledging. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, an ancient superstition. 
__label__SPOCK One hundred twenty degrees. 
__label__SPOCK I'm aware of that, Captain. I trust that you are aware of the reverse. 
__label__SPOCK No problems here, sir. 
__label__SPOCK We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently.
__label__SPOCK T'Pau. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T.
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK One man cannot summon the future. 
__label__SPOCK Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field. 
__label__SPOCK What is our name? Who are we?
__label__SPOCK Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating.
__label__SPOCK The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain.
__label__SPOCK My big chance? For what, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK She is dangerous only to your authority, sir. 
__label__SPOCK The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Amazing. This deck is covered with ice. 
__label__SPOCK It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex. 
__label__SPOCK Is there a structure of some sort near you? 
__label__SPOCK In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course.
__label__SPOCK There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate.
__label__SPOCK As you may recall from your histories, this conflict was fought,  [Engineering]
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Or it toward us. 
__label__SPOCK True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, you have never commanded a starship. 
__label__SPOCK First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain. 
__label__SPOCK Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK My pleasure, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It is difficult to know which is best, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold. 
__label__SPOCK No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War. 
__label__SPOCK Better than warp seven. 
__label__SPOCK Status of mission, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK When transporter is energised, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads. 
__label__SPOCK This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire culture based on this. 
__label__SPOCK Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and communications under repair. Random chance seems to have operated in our favour. 
__label__SPOCK Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it? 
__label__SPOCK I find them strangely attractive. 
__label__SPOCK Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a large, well-armed landing party. 
__label__SPOCK It could happen. 
__label__SPOCK Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. 
__label__SPOCK I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down. 
__label__SPOCK Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre.
__label__SPOCK Your recommendations, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK I do not desire a ship of my own. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this. 
__label__SPOCK Mind probing? Hypnosis? 
__label__SPOCK Captain.
__label__SPOCK That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal spines? 
__label__SPOCK I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so. 
__label__SPOCK Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. (into communicator as Kirk joins him.) Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make? 
__label__SPOCK They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences. 
__label__SPOCK Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element?
__label__SPOCK Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians, Captain. It may work. It may not. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the warriors. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It's incredibly powerful. 
__label__SPOCK Reverse engines and come about. Lay in spiral evasive course for Kukulkan's ship. 
__label__SPOCK It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not show. 
__label__SPOCK I do not understand, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past)
__label__SPOCK I dare say you will. Come now. 
__label__SPOCK Always in the past tense.
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli Six. 
__label__SPOCK A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system.
__label__SPOCK Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials. 
__label__SPOCK There must be some logical explanation. 
__label__SPOCK Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way. 
__label__SPOCK There is a vessel out there, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Spock, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Because it is not there. 
__label__SPOCK How many coming, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors are picking up three ships, Captain. Magnification shows them to be Romulan warships. 
__label__SPOCK Would you rather stay here? 
__label__SPOCK Very well, sir. Engineer? 
__label__SPOCK It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it. 
__label__SPOCK A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say. 
__label__SPOCK A moment, Captain. The results are unclear. 
__label__SPOCK We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy. 
__label__SPOCK I shall do so. 
__label__SPOCK Debris on our scanners. 
__label__SPOCK I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland? 
__label__SPOCK If so, it is the first ever discovered. An important historical find. 
__label__SPOCK May I have them, please? 
__label__SPOCK Please, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities. First, a space buoy of some kind. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing but Doctor McCoy's gloating. 
__label__SPOCK We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.
__label__SPOCK Queen to queen's level three. 
__label__SPOCK At norm, Mister Kyle. Controls at neutral. 
__label__SPOCK I understand. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. Your Earth people glorify organised violence for forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately.
__label__SPOCK Eminently practical. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy, you do not know your good fortune. IF the times were different, you would have to recalibrate for an Andorian. 
__label__SPOCK The stars. 
__label__SPOCK About as much as a mother learns from a six month old infant. 
__label__SPOCK Reading goes off my scale, Captain. Must be a mile in diameter.
__label__SPOCK Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. 
__label__SPOCK I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared. Energise.
__label__SPOCK I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments. 
__label__SPOCK We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface which seems to have something to do with the force field. 
__label__SPOCK Correct, Commodore. Now if you'll watch the star map, you'll see the Milky Way. Here is Beta Niobe, and here is Earth. It corresponds exactly with Arret. By superimposing both star maps, we will see where two stars occupy the same place in both universes. The red spheres indicate where two stars are in the same space. No pair are novas in both universes. 
__label__SPOCK It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of this sector. 
__label__SPOCK He did say his planet was hidden, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK That is very unlike the captain. 
__label__SPOCK Chronometers moving forward again, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged.
__label__SPOCK I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning nothing. 
__label__SPOCK This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You recall his name. 
__label__SPOCK Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live. 
__label__SPOCK Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down there. 
__label__SPOCK It seems the only way. 
__label__SPOCK Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)
__label__SPOCK Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack becomes even more imperative. 
__label__SPOCK Please continue, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK (brings over a magazine) Captain, I thought you might find this interesting. 
__label__SPOCK We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar system.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety is vital to the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed, Captain. Tribbles appear to be a much more effective weapon. 
__label__SPOCK Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders. 
__label__SPOCK Surely, you're coming, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Go ahead, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. In a very short time. 
__label__SPOCK I was conserving energy, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Logical. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities. (the sound of a transporter off screen) T'Pring. Explain. 
__label__SPOCK I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified. 
__label__SPOCK A serious breach of orders, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do violence? 
__label__SPOCK Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments. 
__label__SPOCK Due to your error, Mister Kyle? 
__label__SPOCK I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all. 
__label__SPOCK The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim.
__label__SPOCK Please restrict your movements, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Security guards to the Bridge. 
__label__SPOCK An extraordinary phenomenon, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy must've told you that twenty four hours is the maximum my body can  MCCOY: I told him. 
__label__SPOCK He's regaining consciousness.
__label__SPOCK You came in a ship? 
__label__SPOCK It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable. 
__label__SPOCK They will not accept their own deaths. 
__label__SPOCK His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I suggest you study this.
__label__SPOCK Spock to Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy. 
__label__SPOCK I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command.
__label__SPOCK I made an error in my computations. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits. 
__label__SPOCK Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.
__label__SPOCK I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential. 
__label__SPOCK Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did. My blood cells are quite different.
__label__SPOCK Are you prepared to beam over? 
__label__SPOCK If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes. 
__label__SPOCK The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of this.
__label__SPOCK Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop? 
__label__SPOCK I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in Engineering. 
__label__SPOCK How about weight? 
__label__SPOCK I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts. 
__label__SPOCK I've run a complete megalyte survey on the computer. 
__label__SPOCK (handing over his own phaser) And give this to Mister Scott in the event I don't return. 
__label__SPOCK The term is amusement park.
__label__SPOCK Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study.  ROJAN: Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise. 
__label__SPOCK We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance.
__label__SPOCK Jim.
__label__SPOCK We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum. 
__label__SPOCK Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen. 
__label__SPOCK Aye, sir. 
__label__SPOCK And Apollo? 
__label__SPOCK No evidence of intelligent life. Atmosphere at surface, eight hundred millibars, breathable. Gravity one point two. Temperature hot, but within Class M limits. 
__label__SPOCK Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger. 
__label__SPOCK Correction, Mister Seven. It appears we did not interfere. The Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like living rock with heavy fore claws. It's settling down now to completely human readings. 
__label__SPOCK Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK If I may suggest, sir? 
__label__SPOCK Is that you, Doctor McCoy, and are you with the Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return.
__label__SPOCK Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised. 
__label__SPOCK You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer. 
__label__SPOCK The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again. 
__label__SPOCK This room. What happens there?
__label__SPOCK Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us. 
__label__SPOCK If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I must agree. 
__label__SPOCK Message from the captain.
__label__SPOCK Explain. 
__label__SPOCK Outpost four disintegrated, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott  [Jefferies tube]
__label__SPOCK No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary. 
__label__SPOCK So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The sun's gravimetric pull increasing. 
__label__SPOCK I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before. 
__label__SPOCK I have checked the supplies, Captain. As expected, they are adequate and there are weapons. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. However, to this point, we have not seen anything more powerful than equipment Starfleet already has. 
__label__SPOCK I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life. 
__label__SPOCK It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.
__label__SPOCK Estimated repair time? 
__label__SPOCK As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level. 
__label__SPOCK Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped, circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles.
__label__SPOCK Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk, I shall consider it. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you too late. 
__label__SPOCK Logical, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor.
__label__SPOCK Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the possibility. 
__label__SPOCK I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her. 
__label__SPOCK Guidance control's taking over. I believe we can allow this ship to go back to its automatic control. 
__label__SPOCK Deck two. It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger. It was not intentional. All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device. 
__label__SPOCK You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it. 
__label__SPOCK I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning. 
__label__SPOCK Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice! 
__label__SPOCK It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact, extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the magnetic force? 
__label__SPOCK Engineer at his post?
__label__SPOCK There is no such word in the linguistics bank? 
__label__SPOCK Sir, you are employing a double negative. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under observation. 
__label__SPOCK The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Most logical. If the flow of time is reversed, then one is born at an old age, and dies in infancy. Your descendants are born before you, and your ancestors are born after you. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, may I ask where you'll be? 
__label__SPOCK That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does express the thought. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir.
__label__SPOCK Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to it. 
__label__SPOCK And we are still increasing speed. Contact with the nova in thirty five point one eight seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps the transporter is the key. 
__label__SPOCK There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push. We have no time for emotionalism. 
__label__SPOCK If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes.
__label__SPOCK The Queen of Hearts and her cards are characters from Alice Through the Looking Glass, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK (with a grin and echoy voice) Hello. Oh, you are a lovely female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years. 
__label__SPOCK Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure you that I have full control over your friends. 
__label__SPOCK Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you. 
__label__SPOCK As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours. 
__label__SPOCK Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Deflector shields at full power. They can't take much more of this. 
__label__SPOCK Captain.
__label__SPOCK The same. You must release Doctor McCoy temporarily. He is needed to find an antidote. 
__label__SPOCK James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet.
__label__SPOCK It can be done. 
__label__SPOCK Spock, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Is there something I can do for you, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work. 
__label__SPOCK I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five. 
__label__SPOCK As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At first we were not certain what it was.
__label__SPOCK Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.
__label__SPOCK None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary. 
__label__SPOCK This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander, Captain Christopher Pike.
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy. Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons. 
__label__SPOCK Absolutely none, Captain. Berthold rays are such a recent discovery. We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. It is known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure.
__label__SPOCK I am not like you. 
__label__SPOCK They might to another Pandronian, Captain. I believe he went that way, Captain. On the other hand  KIRK: I think we've lost him. That way. 
__label__SPOCK And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty. 
__label__SPOCK It would require physical contact, which is impossible, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Anything else, sir? 
__label__SPOCK I presume my calculations are correct. 
__label__SPOCK It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way. 
__label__SPOCK Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course.
__label__SPOCK The Terratins are making available all possible dilithium. The crystals are small, but I believe they will provide enough power until we can obtain larger pieces. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will do even better. Would it not, Commander? 
__label__SPOCK You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I shall operate the transporter. You have two minutes and ten seconds. 
__label__SPOCK It is, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott is still with us. 
__label__SPOCK I also picked up indications of large cities. 
__label__SPOCK Our air is being pumped full of nitrous oxide. Better known as laughing gas. But it's no laughing matter, especially for Vulcans. 
__label__SPOCK Not here. The doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them. 
__label__SPOCK No, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive. 
__label__SPOCK Listen to me. I'm going to come into your thoughts. And at the same time, you will come into mine. 
__label__SPOCK Jim! 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further. 
__label__SPOCK A capability, I'm afraid, out of the reach of most humans. 
__label__SPOCK I was curious to see how they appeared.
__label__SPOCK The Empire shall be overthrown, of course. 
__label__SPOCK (bad static) Captain, I have a reading from Life Support centre  KIRK: Spock, I can't hear you. Check your circuits. Is there a malfunction? 
__label__SPOCK No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment. 
__label__SPOCK Try inverse phasing. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we could preserve and study this  (But the little puppets collapse and die. Smoke rises from the bodies.)
__label__SPOCK I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense. 
__label__SPOCK Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this body. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that Sargon will die with him.
__label__SPOCK No, sir. You did. 
__label__SPOCK This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race. 
__label__SPOCK Three to beam up, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir.
__label__SPOCK Incredible, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Still approaching, Captain. Going sublight. It continues to probe us. Its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, wait.
__label__SPOCK Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.
__label__SPOCK Nor have I. 
__label__SPOCK You cannot go back? 
__label__SPOCK An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe.
__label__SPOCK This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her.
__label__SPOCK Here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fuel temperature.
__label__SPOCK Have you tried overload?
__label__SPOCK Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals. 
__label__SPOCK Understood. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian ship. Mister Sulu, lock in phaser tracking controls. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. I presume your log will show that Commodore Decker died in the line of duty. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind.
__label__SPOCK There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind. 
__label__SPOCK Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council. 
__label__SPOCK I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening, gentlemen. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, what is our position? 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps you were. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. I know what it is like. 
__label__SPOCK About three hundred years. 
__label__SPOCK There is something else, Captain. I'm getting a reading of some kind of power from that building) 
__label__SPOCK Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands? 
__label__SPOCK And we never fired upon her. 
__label__SPOCK Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion. 
__label__SPOCK The Ambassador? 
__label__SPOCK Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles. Outer layer studded with space debris and waste. Interior consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi-fluid central mass. Condition, living. 
__label__SPOCK Approximately warp fifteen, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Comply, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be involved. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. We are relatively stable at the moment. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart. 
__label__SPOCK I would say so, Captain. The instinctive reaction of all frightened creatures is to retreat to a place of safety. 
__label__SPOCK I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit.
__label__SPOCK They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before. 
__label__SPOCK Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately, there. That is, of course, a crude estimation. 
__label__SPOCK What was it? 
__label__SPOCK Evidently something totally alien in all respects. 
__label__SPOCK Damage to Klingon number three shield. Number four shield obliterated. Loss of manoeuvre power. 
__label__SPOCK I would find it most interesting, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Cut power, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, we must restore communications with the landing party. 
__label__SPOCK I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers. 
__label__SPOCK Deflectors, full intensity.
__label__SPOCK It would seem the only answer. 
__label__SPOCK Even if he shouldn't. 
__label__SPOCK You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later. Join us. Please. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's giving out again. 
__label__SPOCK I have a theory, Captain, but first I suggest that if Officer Scott moves away from the computer, it might feel less threatened. 
__label__SPOCK Power up. All instruments activated. All readings normal. All go. 
__label__SPOCK Tonal control. Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us reverse power. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK What drug? 
__label__SPOCK Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death. 
__label__SPOCK I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta. 
__label__SPOCK I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are you ready? 
__label__SPOCK He has the capability, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, they are highly intelligent. I'm sure they are quite aware of the purpose of each piece of equipment now. 
__label__SPOCK It should be possible to filter out the human factors. 
__label__SPOCK Animals in a zoo rarely do. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel. 
__label__SPOCK Have a look at this, Captain.
__label__SPOCK The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain. Shall we turn off the tractor beam? 
__label__SPOCK That is to be expected. The surface of this planet shifts constantly. Even the Vedala are not certain where the Soul is. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals. 
__label__SPOCK Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity, though of a unique technology. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal. 
__label__SPOCK I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference. 
__label__SPOCK The underground complex is shielded by a combination of granite and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate. 
__label__SPOCK This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK Revenge, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense. 
__label__SPOCK The object's neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible. 
__label__SPOCK Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume they are dead. 
__label__SPOCK What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish? 
__label__SPOCK Without them, it could be a beaker full of death. 
__label__SPOCK Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase. 
__label__SPOCK Our direction is indicated. 
__label__SPOCK Your decision is most illogical, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing. 
__label__SPOCK Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do anything that changes history  KIRK: I'm aware of that. But I must know if he's lying, and we can't answer that sitting up here. Have ship's stores prepare the proper costumes. Stand by to beam us down.
__label__SPOCK Not who, what. I believe our practical joker is the Enterprise itself. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room. The term was neural neutraliser.
__label__SPOCK Captain? Captain? Captain?
__label__SPOCK At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor.
__label__SPOCK That is correct, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott? 
__label__SPOCK A Kzinti spacecraft. 
__label__SPOCK Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate we are charting course to (pause) Captain, Cheron lies between four oh three mark seven and mark nine. 
__label__SPOCK That is true. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.
__label__SPOCK Tell the court, please, Captain Kirk. Would you say that since Salem, humans have changed? 
__label__SPOCK I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity.
__label__SPOCK You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are.
__label__SPOCK The mirror. 
__label__SPOCK Continue. 
__label__SPOCK Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising. 
__label__SPOCK You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. Listen to me. 
__label__SPOCK He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
__label__SPOCK Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer? 
__label__SPOCK I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by the Tholians. 
__label__SPOCK Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience. 
__label__SPOCK State your correct name for the record. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, please go. Somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable  [McCoy's office]
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course. 
__label__SPOCK Planet's rotation is carrying primary target beyond arc of phaser lock. 
__label__SPOCK They're trying to contact us directly. I can make out something.
__label__SPOCK Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less than one hundred metres away. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Please do. 
__label__SPOCK I do not understand your reasoning. 
__label__SPOCK We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet.
__label__SPOCK Very well. Come with me. 
__label__SPOCK Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. 
__label__SPOCK I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three.
__label__SPOCK Yes, what did you want? 
__label__SPOCK They are not about to get it, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Standard ion type, Captain, but quite violent (Enterprise shakes) and unpredictable. 
__label__SPOCK It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love. 
__label__SPOCK It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint accuracy is required. If the transportee should materialise inside a solid object, a deck or wall. 
__label__SPOCK Do we have maximum magnification, Lieutenant? 
__label__SPOCK We are very interested in your world. 
__label__SPOCK I had hoped I was wrong. 
__label__SPOCK Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. That is unquestionably part of what I am doing. 
__label__SPOCK So soon? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. Quite understandable. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm picking up life readings. Spock out.
__label__SPOCK Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective bending of light. But the power cost is enormous. 
__label__SPOCK No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the survey vessel SS Beagle. 
__label__SPOCK While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians return, I shall go with them. 
__label__SPOCK Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some natural phenomena. 
__label__SPOCK A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here.
__label__SPOCK That's an unusual request. 
__label__SPOCK Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as you expected them to. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, scientifically  KIRK: You'll both be filing reports. Make your comments and recommendations then.
__label__SPOCK Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.
__label__SPOCK If the alien is creating these events, Captain, it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Live long and prosper, Miranda. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the power reading now includes an electronic probe. We are being scanned. 
__label__SPOCK Well, keep trying, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters. 
__label__SPOCK Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Most peculiar. This indicates there is another stasis box circling Beta Lyrae. 
__label__SPOCK You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However  MCCOY: There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor, and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery. 
__label__SPOCK If we do, Captain, we may also encounter forces and phenomena beyond our understanding. 
__label__SPOCK I would prefer that you state it. 
__label__SPOCK He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains. 
__label__SPOCK An underground? How are you organised? 
__label__SPOCK The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out. 
__label__SPOCK This is of great scientific importance, Captain. We're actually passing through ripples in time. 
__label__SPOCK It will have to do. 
__label__SPOCK Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect. 
__label__SPOCK One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a period of three days. 
__label__SPOCK Specify. Point of origin. 
__label__SPOCK There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies, Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman. 
__label__SPOCK No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question. Dismissed. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor.
__label__SPOCK Where to, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation. 
__label__SPOCK In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our present course.
__label__SPOCK You might be wise to start. 
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with. 
__label__SPOCK It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the series. But if this is that probe  NOMAD: I will scan your star charts. 
__label__SPOCK Progress report. 
__label__SPOCK Engine systems coming on, Captain.
__label__SPOCK You suggest sabotage, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Number of enemy forces. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I never will understand humans. How could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made such a fatal error? 
__label__SPOCK The chances are very much against it. 
__label__SPOCK That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. 
__label__SPOCK I see. (pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we shall continue on our present course. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless it is your intention to declare a mutiny. 
__label__SPOCK Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we started from. 
__label__SPOCK Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system. 
__label__SPOCK Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant. 
__label__SPOCK I love you. However, I hate you. 
__label__SPOCK I fail to see what they find so amusing. 
__label__SPOCK This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're inside, somewhere. 
__label__SPOCK Nerve tissue. Mass density is exceptionally high. Readings indicate the beings used almost seventy percent of their brains. A very high ratio. 
__label__SPOCK You may be premature. There are many possibilities. 
__label__SPOCK He's our commanding officer and our friend. 
__label__SPOCK That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated, and yet you  [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer.
__label__SPOCK An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful.
__label__SPOCK I have the weapon. 
__label__SPOCK They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here. 
__label__SPOCK We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.
__label__SPOCK A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well co-ordinated. 
__label__SPOCK I would say none, Captain. The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it. I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves. 
__label__SPOCK Eighteen years. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects. 
__label__SPOCK A Vulcan would not cry out so. 
__label__SPOCK Definitely a space vessel of some type. 
__label__SPOCK Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual. 
__label__SPOCK Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. 
__label__SPOCK Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape, roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre. 
__label__SPOCK No known race, Captain. Nevertheless, it will contact us in one point four minutes. 
__label__SPOCK Of course, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now. 
__label__SPOCK Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us. 
__label__SPOCK On humans. 
__label__SPOCK At present, yes. (his tricorder beeps) Odd. 
__label__SPOCK A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir.
__label__SPOCK It appears so. They do not feel we belong in their zoo. 
__label__SPOCK And they are of course accurate, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Negative.
__label__SPOCK We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical selections. 
__label__SPOCK The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it. 
__label__SPOCK Creature, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible. I can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid. 
__label__SPOCK Don't let her touch the wand, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain. 
__label__SPOCK Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original bodies when we beamed down to the planet. 
__label__SPOCK We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest.
__label__SPOCK She would not jeopardise other lives. 
__label__SPOCK Under present conditions, extremely poor. 
__label__SPOCK Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down.
__label__SPOCK I seem to have lost track of time. 
__label__SPOCK This new Klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it can immobilize a starship. The energy drain on the Klingon ship would be enormous. 
__label__SPOCK I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away. 
__label__SPOCK Why risk your life for his? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred Vulcans aboard, all dead. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights into this sector for years. 
__label__SPOCK You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof  KIRK: I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.
__label__SPOCK Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence. 
__label__SPOCK Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time. 
__label__SPOCK That was the planet Gothos, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack. 
__label__SPOCK Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based? 
__label__SPOCK We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely. 
__label__SPOCK And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out. 
__label__SPOCK I can think no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura.
__label__SPOCK Thank you.
__label__SPOCK We have a what, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.
__label__SPOCK I shall endeavour to keep it under control. 
__label__SPOCK I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do.
__label__SPOCK Emergency impulse power. 
__label__SPOCK Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled. 
__label__SPOCK I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or a freak of nature. The fact remains that life can exist in that area. 
__label__SPOCK The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base. 
__label__SPOCK That is evidently their intention, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero space density.
__label__SPOCK I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours. 
__label__SPOCK Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates. 
__label__SPOCK We're registering a slightly higher than normal magnetic flux.
__label__SPOCK Perhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve. 
__label__SPOCK Will they electrify the exterior of this ship? 
__label__SPOCK And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious. 
__label__SPOCK Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these. 
__label__SPOCK Yet the uniform on which you wear it fits as well as ever.
__label__SPOCK Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our tractor beam. 
__label__SPOCK I need your advice. 
__label__SPOCK The Klingon? 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. (a third bolt approaching) Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres. 
__label__SPOCK It might, to some. 
__label__SPOCK I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. We agree. 
__label__SPOCK Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We are on the surface, Mister Scott. Reprogram the transporter as previously directed. 
__label__SPOCK A wasteful use of energy, Doctor. I believe they can hear you without your shouting. 
__label__SPOCK A very interesting game, this poker.
__label__SPOCK This is the U.S.S. Enterprise calling the Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a conference. Please answer. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us here.
__label__SPOCK It would seem so. Silicon-based. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK Address intercraft. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. Apparently the two universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions. 
__label__SPOCK I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However, you must at least confiscate his phaser. 
__label__SPOCK Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured. 
__label__SPOCK If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her.
__label__SPOCK I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, Doctor, and prevent further spread of the affliction. 
__label__SPOCK It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search? 
__label__SPOCK In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest  KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert.
__label__SPOCK I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all. 
__label__SPOCK The Slavers and all their subjects were exterminated in the war that followed. Intelligent life had to evolve all over again. The stasis boxes are the only remnant of those lost civilisations. 
__label__SPOCK That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct. 
__label__SPOCK Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years. 
__label__SPOCK Cut, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Projection, Captain. Unreal. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. Silicon. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die? 
__label__SPOCK Not bad. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're recording this, Yeoman? 
__label__SPOCK There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing one eight. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew. 
__label__SPOCK Then think about it that way, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death of your friend. It is most regrettable. 
__label__SPOCK Two spacemen marching to a drum. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians? 
__label__SPOCK I can try, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself. Your mate for all time. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy. 
__label__SPOCK And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your phaser? That is still Jim's body. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I believe I  STONE: I'll take that. 
__label__SPOCK To a degree, with our own species and with some others, but the Lactran intelligence is eons beyond mine. 
__label__SPOCK Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A system. 
__label__SPOCK Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings.
__label__SPOCK The delay may be deliberate. 
__label__SPOCK He was beamed directly to your council chambers. Please verify your co-ordinates. 
__label__SPOCK Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a great deal. I see no practical use for them. 
__label__SPOCK If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves. 
__label__SPOCK Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure tritanium. 
__label__SPOCK Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor, equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances. 
__label__SPOCK Crude methods, but effective. 
__label__SPOCK Good.
__label__SPOCK I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien. 
__label__SPOCK The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen.
__label__SPOCK Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.
__label__SPOCK Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical. 
__label__SPOCK We don't, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Radiation increasing.
__label__SPOCK Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Like Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless. 
__label__SPOCK According to Federation records, this is the first. 
__label__SPOCK I believe they are all immobilised, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience. 
__label__SPOCK I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time. 
__label__SPOCK I'll need some time for the computations, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I should think interesting would suffice. 
__label__SPOCK Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
__label__SPOCK We'll let the captain handle this. 
__label__SPOCK Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it out) Perhaps everything. 
__label__SPOCK I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting to blame your personnel. 
__label__SPOCK Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK I'm sorry.
__label__SPOCK I'm sorry, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK But a defensible entrance, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately, and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities. 
__label__SPOCK You said it was fused. How? 
__label__SPOCK Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were inoperative. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The pigmentation changes associated with the disease in our computer records, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Entirely possible. 
__label__SPOCK The search parties, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space.
__label__SPOCK Then you knew you were a carrier. 
__label__SPOCK Guards! Cover me. 
__label__SPOCK For once, I agree with you. 
__label__SPOCK The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? Captain? Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant contentment. 
__label__SPOCK Stole a spaceship. 
__label__SPOCK Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems, barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities. 
__label__SPOCK Prepare for interphase in  [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK Quickly, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Someone strangled this woman.
__label__SPOCK Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It carries perishable drugs  KIRK: Skip the recitation, Spock. I know the facts. 
__label__SPOCK Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir? 
__label__SPOCK It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet. She offered her life. 
__label__SPOCK This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago. 
__label__SPOCK Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy.
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.
__label__SPOCK Not likely, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Mister Chekov. Manoeuvre completed, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Logical, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible. 
__label__SPOCK Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets. 
__label__SPOCK There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement.
__label__SPOCK Yes, Doctor. This area has been carefully prepared for human types. The aliens are safe now. 
__label__SPOCK A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser. I have found villagers who will corroborate it. 
__label__SPOCK You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again? 
__label__SPOCK It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time. 
__label__SPOCK Miss Finney, come with me, please. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk, come in please. 
__label__SPOCK This is how you observe, by being captured? 
__label__SPOCK Considerably, Mister Boma. 
__label__SPOCK Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now  KIRK: Now they're back to normal. 
__label__SPOCK My name is Selek, an humble cousin descended of T'Pel and Sasak.
__label__SPOCK That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you. 
__label__SPOCK Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve  KIRK: Never mind, Mister Spock, it's no use. 
__label__SPOCK Ready to transport on my order. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK The debris is what's left of the Antares. 
__label__SPOCK Your recommendation? 
__label__SPOCK Very well, sir. 
__label__SPOCK You are mistaken, sir. Our only purpose here is to find the means of reversing our mutations. 
__label__SPOCK Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design. 
__label__SPOCK Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions. 
__label__SPOCK Or a single phaser with much longer contact. 
__label__SPOCK The fact one of my ancestors married a human female  KIRK: Terrible having bad blood like that. 
__label__SPOCK If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed. 
__label__SPOCK On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was indeed fortunate. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. 
__label__SPOCK I should say they've been here and been removed. 
__label__SPOCK Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful. 
__label__SPOCK Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the data. 
__label__SPOCK But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to react like a human. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it. 
__label__SPOCK That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know.
__label__SPOCK Can you recall what happened, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK It's possible. 
__label__SPOCK (noticing a plant moving) Jim! 
__label__SPOCK I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend.
__label__SPOCK We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice. 
__label__SPOCK Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard? 
__label__SPOCK These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did not understand. 
__label__SPOCK I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent. 
__label__SPOCK I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time. 
__label__SPOCK Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to protect yourself. Clear? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position. 
__label__SPOCK Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure worked. The vent is closed. 
__label__SPOCK What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions. 
__label__SPOCK If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am. 
__label__SPOCK There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK If you so desire. 
__label__SPOCK We did, Captain. The situation required our return. 
__label__SPOCK Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate Earth woman.
__label__SPOCK You refer to the humanoid? 
__label__SPOCK Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man  KIRK: Doctor Sevrin is their leader? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for life. 
__label__SPOCK Patience, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK This did not happen before. My life decision was made without the sacrifice of yours, old friend. I know there is pain. I can help a little. Sleep now. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy! 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have been eliminated. 
__label__SPOCK How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse engines directly. 
__label__SPOCK Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy. I realise that the crew are your prime concern. You can best serve them in your laboratory. I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there it is. 
__label__SPOCK He came up from engineering, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Theft, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit. Fascinating. A remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a glacial age reoccurred. This underground complex was developed for the women. The men remained above, and a male-female schism took place. A fascinating cultural development of a kind which never  MCCOY: I knew it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. 
__label__SPOCK The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.
__label__SPOCK It would seem so. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will help us. 
__label__SPOCK Brooding, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK My legs. They're broken. 
__label__SPOCK Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability.
__label__SPOCK Captain, I insist upon going. Christine. I can't stand the thought of any danger to her, to the woman I love. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we have been hit by a kind of projected stasis field.
__label__SPOCK Ready to resume course, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital energy to the bodies of the women. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, our phasers are gone. 
__label__SPOCK Your chances of survival are not promising.
__label__SPOCK Understood, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK A fliwer, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected.
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK No. 
__label__SPOCK I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial bigotry. Most distasteful. 
__label__SPOCK At our present rate of consumption, we'll exhaust our impulse power long before then. 
__label__SPOCK Affect repairs. Captain Kirk, come in please. 
__label__SPOCK I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant. 
__label__SPOCK The job of librarian would be no less challenging, Captain, but it would undoubtedly be a lot less dangerous. 
__label__SPOCK I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before. 
__label__SPOCK But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov.
__label__SPOCK Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable. 
__label__SPOCK In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK Not generally. But there have been exceptions. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of this. The instantaneous transmutation of matter. I doubt that they are responsible. 
__label__SPOCK We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there is no motive for violence.  GELDER: Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?
__label__SPOCK Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcans do not approve of violence. 
__label__SPOCK Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the possibilities of  KIRK: Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual admiration society, but I'd like to know where the tribbles are. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I didn't say that exactly. 
__label__SPOCK If we assume the cloud is a living being, we must also assume it needs some kind of food to sustain itself. 
__label__SPOCK There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Jim. What is it now? 
__label__SPOCK Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? 
__label__SPOCK They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent. 
__label__SPOCK Five weeks, three days, two hours and four minutes to be exact, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us. 
__label__SPOCK I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge.
__label__SPOCK Welcome back, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It occurred. I dismissed it. 
__label__SPOCK Because I kicked Chuft-Captain. Consider. Chuft-Captain has been attacked by an herbivorous pacifist, an eater of leaves and roots. One who traditionally does not fight. And the ultimate insult, I left him alive. Chuft-Captain's honour is at stake. He must seek personal revenge before he can call for help. 
__label__SPOCK Energise. 
__label__SPOCK Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh?
__label__SPOCK Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? 
__label__SPOCK This bridge is under complete control. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile. 
__label__SPOCK I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK I hardly find that fitting. 
__label__SPOCK It would be most illogical that a stasis box would remain here undiscovered for so long. Beta Lyrae is one of the rare spectacles of the galaxy. Almost every ship that passes stops to see it. 
__label__SPOCK I think I shall not. Peace and long life. 
__label__SPOCK I do not believe they can, sir. High rank probability. Their S2 graf unit, which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive, began giving off depleted energy readings. Kor decided to try to bluff it through. 
__label__SPOCK A practical idea, Captain. It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you. 
__label__SPOCK I am not certain. I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity. 
__label__SPOCK I am a logical man, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
__label__SPOCK Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand mechanics. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. It fled the ship when it thought we would crash into the dead star. 
__label__SPOCK Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look. 
__label__SPOCK An appropriate choice of terms. However, it is notoriously difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been drawn. 
__label__SPOCK Gothos again, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Most illogical.
__label__SPOCK Computed. 
__label__SPOCK The rain forest is especially thick in his district. Life on this planet appears to be geologically younger than one would expect, given the age of this star. 
__label__SPOCK I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar. 
__label__SPOCK I accept the responsibility, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you? 
__label__SPOCK Lucien, you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate humans. Why? 
__label__SPOCK We have lost warp power. If we don't break the tractor beam within sixty seconds, we never will. 
__label__SPOCK Commodore Stocker. 
__label__SPOCK That seems reasonable. 
__label__SPOCK My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol. 
__label__SPOCK I am pleasantly surprised at your capacity for deductive reasoning, Captain. When you are not being bellicose, there appears to be no end to your arsenal of formidable talents. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century. Moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons. 
__label__SPOCK No additional Klingons detected, Captain. It is an alien life force, a single entity. I cannot ascertain its location. 
__label__SPOCK Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. That's correct. One thing at a time. Ah, ah, mmm. (normal voice) That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting that the villagers know about phasers. 
__label__SPOCK You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove ineffective against the captain. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time changed. The next interphase will occur here. 
__label__SPOCK Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular course. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but it must function. 
__label__SPOCK It's quite real, Doctor. Watch out for the claws. I think it prudent to remember that on this planet, anything we think may be used against us. We must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more ammunition. 
__label__SPOCK I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated. 
__label__SPOCK The wands are accumulators, receptors to attract energy, motion, sound, light, heat, every kind of energy around them. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, we are accelerating. We are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness. 
__label__SPOCK I believe our regulations are quite clear, Doctor. An immediate identity check and medical examination are a standard requirement at this point. 
__label__SPOCK I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition. 
__label__SPOCK Perfectly normal. I will append your summary to the report. Was there something else, Miss Chapel? 
__label__SPOCK Remarkable. 
__label__SPOCK My knowledge of computers for one thing. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, they have concluded they cannot break through your mind on a one to one basis. They are now gathering the mental strength of all five of them to break through. 
__label__SPOCK Not at this interphase. 
__label__SPOCK The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously. It should become rigid enough for a burst of warp power to shatter it. 
__label__SPOCK Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? 
__label__SPOCK Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here yesterday. 
__label__SPOCK Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
__label__SPOCK The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic interference, no breakdown in your equipment. 
__label__SPOCK I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments. 
__label__SPOCK Miss Chapel. 
__label__SPOCK That is correct. 
__label__SPOCK Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
__label__SPOCK I believe I said that. 
__label__SPOCK What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect. 
__label__SPOCK If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge. 
__label__SPOCK Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that.
__label__SPOCK Composition? 
__label__SPOCK For the record, how do we describe him? Pure mentality? Force of intellect? Embodied energy? Superbeing? He must be classified, sir. 
__label__SPOCK The cloaking device is working perfectly, and the commander has informed me that even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped. 
__label__SPOCK You recall that energy field we passed through? 
__label__SPOCK It certainly can support life forms. But I cannot speculate on what type without further data. Mister Arex is conducting a sensor scan now. 
__label__SPOCK Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet? 
__label__SPOCK Whoever it is, Captain, has no authorisation. Lieutenant, raise the shuttlecraft. 
__label__SPOCK Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult. 
__label__SPOCK You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming we survive to reach a Starbase. But you are relieved. Commodore. I do not wish to place you under arrest. 
__label__SPOCK Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
__label__SPOCK I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt. 
__label__SPOCK What purpose? 
__label__SPOCK (muttering) If you could create a diversion, I might be able to find the control room and open the force field. 
__label__SPOCK Checkmate. 
__label__SPOCK We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's those disruptors versus our hand phasers. 
__label__SPOCK He doesn't hear you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it on a collision course with Daran Five. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure. 
__label__SPOCK It's closing fast on the Constellation. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom? 
__label__SPOCK There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's symbols. They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing. 
__label__SPOCK I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind. 
__label__SPOCK It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present.
__label__SPOCK On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement? 
__label__SPOCK Greetings, Mister Advisor. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity. 
__label__SPOCK We are being held.
__label__SPOCK Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family.
__label__SPOCK Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago.
__label__SPOCK Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours. 
__label__SPOCK I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals. 
__label__SPOCK Extremely little, Ensign. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty, are there not? 
__label__SPOCK I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I plead with thee! I beg! 
__label__SPOCK Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Progress, Mister Sulu? 
__label__SPOCK And you know where home is, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Mudd. And he has Christine. She's in danger. My love. 
__label__SPOCK Your reaction, One of recognition. 
__label__SPOCK A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field. 
__label__SPOCK I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked. 
__label__SPOCK I have experienced a slight flush, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed. Is that correct? 
__label__SPOCK An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix. 
__label__SPOCK Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, what about the people on the planet? 
__label__SPOCK Let me see. (throws a few more switches and picks up the microphone.) Enterprise, this is Mister Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true. 
__label__SPOCK We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter. 
__label__SPOCK That's not unusual, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship. 
__label__SPOCK Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we cannot be positive. 
__label__SPOCK You will not discuss this with ship's crew or starbase personnel. Do you read?
__label__SPOCK We're losing sensor contact, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We discussed that possibility earlier. But you will need this information. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element. 
__label__SPOCK Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. 
__label__SPOCK Worries, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Yes.
__label__SPOCK Captain, you sent such a message this morning. 
__label__SPOCK She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not bear to hurt either of you.
__label__SPOCK Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The best I should have been able to attain was a draw. 
__label__SPOCK The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of islands, life form readings. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people, and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no evidence of this. 
__label__SPOCK It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
__label__SPOCK Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes. 
__label__SPOCK I thought I just did, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Bows and arrows, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Neither have I. 
__label__SPOCK Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part? (a nod) I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species.
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. Continue the search. 
__label__SPOCK There are many things in our galaxy like the one you just perceived. 
__label__SPOCK Momentarily. 
__label__SPOCK It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien presence. 
__label__SPOCK Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut. 
__label__SPOCK We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt. 
__label__SPOCK Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth. 
__label__SPOCK Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk, we are ready. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Someone tried to kill him. 
__label__SPOCK That sensor ghost is moving closer. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? 
__label__SPOCK Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon. 
__label__SPOCK Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years ago. Inconclusive. 
__label__SPOCK Oh, that's quite understandable. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of it? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver you leave much to be desired. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. Why do you ask? 
__label__SPOCK Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the planet, on the lower hemisphere. Humanoid readings. 
__label__SPOCK Deflectors holding, but weakening. We must retreat, Commodore.
__label__SPOCK Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid zero four zero. 
__label__SPOCK I have already begun investigation into that possibility, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that  KRYTON: Permission to speak was not given. 
__label__SPOCK We read you, Captain. Wave bombardment has just ceased. 
__label__SPOCK Your uniform, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. I would recommend a discreet distance. 
__label__SPOCK My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt. (Scott is continuing to work) The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. My first command. 
__label__SPOCK We hear you perfectly, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I have their surgeon's log, Captain. Their last log entry, Captain, on screen. 
__label__SPOCK Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside. 
__label__SPOCK This woman will assist me. (to Chapel) You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory. 
__label__SPOCK Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions. 
__label__SPOCK It has not been tested. 
__label__SPOCK Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move. 
__label__SPOCK What of Lazarus? 
__label__SPOCK Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK It appears to be a legitimate fog. Perhaps the humidification system is  KIRK: Here, Spock. Whoops! 
__label__SPOCK Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK My duty as an officer is to obey him. 
__label__SPOCK This is Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Nor does Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Dust. Apparently these instruments have not been recently used. 
__label__SPOCK That would seem a logical conclusion. 
__label__SPOCK Force field, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg forgiveness. 
__label__SPOCK I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command. 
__label__SPOCK What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Just before you disappeared, Captain, I discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron. 
__label__SPOCK And most sophisticated. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded. 
__label__SPOCK Sord, what did you think you saw back there? 
__label__SPOCK All systems report normal, Captain. No ascertainable damage.
__label__SPOCK About two thousand metric tons.
__label__SPOCK My blood is T-negative, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Approximately two hundred and forty years. 
__label__SPOCK Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident, setting off a nuclear holocaust. 
__label__SPOCK No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very little excess weight, except among the passengers. 
__label__SPOCK Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. 
__label__SPOCK However, let me remind you, we have only five hours left to  (Kirk closes his communicator)
__label__SPOCK Most curious. 
__label__SPOCK Nurse, you should CHAPEL: Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how you feel. You hide it, but you do have feeling. Oh, how we must hurt you, torture you.
__label__SPOCK A very meritorious idea, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. And beautiful. 
__label__SPOCK Verified, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere. Sensors read no life forms. 
__label__SPOCK Where can he go? 
__label__SPOCK Ask me no further questions. I will not answer. 
__label__SPOCK Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.
__label__SPOCK A statistical probability. 
__label__SPOCK A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him? 
__label__SPOCK I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient! 
__label__SPOCK No, Captain, but this far from a G1 star, it is logical to assume they had some kind of warp drive. 
__label__SPOCK Mudd? 
__label__SPOCK You've been most restrained since we left Organia. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. 
__label__SPOCK Just ahead. 
__label__SPOCK I can't. 
__label__SPOCK Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially irrational. 
__label__SPOCK To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict. 
__label__SPOCK A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is.
__label__SPOCK Stand by to beam aboard injured parties. Medical team to the transporter room. 
__label__SPOCK Next tape, please.
__label__SPOCK Forgive me, Commander. I was overcome by the moment. Goodbye. 
__label__SPOCK It'll take time to correct, sir. 
__label__SPOCK The spherical thing ahead of you, the matter you intend to consume, sense it closely. 
__label__SPOCK I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be little choice. 
__label__SPOCK You have eight minutes, forty one seconds. 
__label__SPOCK He knows, Doctor. He knows. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. The Klingon ship has simply moved into contact range. She is pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed and on a parallel course. 
__label__SPOCK The Disrupters? Who are they? 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their thoughts are becoming hers. 
__label__SPOCK A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection. Peace, harmony. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot. 
__label__SPOCK From the outpost's protective shield. Cast rodinium. This is the hardest substance known to our science. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a remarkable instrument. 
__label__SPOCK You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in any way possible. We'll be back shortly. 
__label__SPOCK Sensor beam on. 
__label__SPOCK Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him. 
__label__SPOCK Energise. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation. 
__label__SPOCK A valid assumption, I would say. 
__label__SPOCK If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing.
__label__SPOCK I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely.
__label__SPOCK Zero seven nine. 
__label__SPOCK His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there is one living creature aboard. Humanoid. He is either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage.
__label__SPOCK The hypo, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK My place is here. If you please, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK He would die almost instantly. 
__label__SPOCK Another hour. 
__label__SPOCK I have none, Captain. Insufficient data. 
__label__SPOCK Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos. 
__label__SPOCK One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me. 
__label__SPOCK I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I have assumed command. 
__label__SPOCK Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown. 
__label__SPOCK Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.
__label__SPOCK Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us. 
__label__SPOCK Answer him, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed. 
__label__SPOCK I've come to the conclusion they are, Captain. But the speed at which the thoughts flow is too great for me to comprehend except for the most fleeting image. 
__label__SPOCK I find this all quite absorbing, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity. 
__label__SPOCK You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours. 
__label__SPOCK I am saying they knew there was a risk. 
__label__SPOCK It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism. 
__label__SPOCK Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like. 
__label__SPOCK Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security. 
__label__SPOCK There is one person aboard who should be especially happy to learn you are alive, Mister Winston. Lieutenant Anne Nored of our security detail. 
__label__SPOCK No. But it is interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Beam us aboard, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK None, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It's never been done.
__label__SPOCK These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well. 
__label__SPOCK I call Lucien as my first witness. 
__label__SPOCK One. 
__label__SPOCK Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem so, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Positive. 
__label__SPOCK Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a return course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot re-cross the barrier using sub light speed. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately.
__label__SPOCK (after brief thought) Yeoman, your phaser. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was a spaceship. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet. On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days. 
__label__SPOCK Origin? 
__label__SPOCK That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae. 
__label__SPOCK But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses.
__label__SPOCK Captain. (gives him a phaser) 
__label__SPOCK Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one degree at a time. 
__label__SPOCK There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave. 
__label__SPOCK It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five. 
__label__SPOCK  Can you help him? 
__label__SPOCK Captain. Tools for finely detailed work. 
__label__SPOCK Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. 
__label__SPOCK And that is impossible. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units. 
__label__SPOCK I was. 
__label__SPOCK They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes. 
__label__SPOCK How many more in your crew? 
__label__SPOCK It appears, Captain, we've been doing what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system. 
__label__SPOCK These are common stones? (scans them) See, Captain? Here and here. 
__label__SPOCK Collision course. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to.
__label__SPOCK I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the responsibility will be mine. Follow me. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress. 
__label__SPOCK The source of the interference is here, Captain. It's not part of the normal equipment. It's like something they jury-rigged during an emergency. 
__label__SPOCK And no one from the ship made such a call.
__label__SPOCK Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate. 
__label__SPOCK A safe tribble would be a contradiction in terms. Tribbles are well known for their proclivities in multiplication. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here.
__label__SPOCK Decaying, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in all sensors to the ship's library computer console.
__label__SPOCK Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan. 
__label__SPOCK No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert. 
__label__SPOCK We must return to our duties aboard ship. 
__label__SPOCK Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning. 
__label__SPOCK The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise. Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK And that is the only thing that has saved us until now. 
__label__SPOCK Aircraft is breaking up, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Using Code two. 
__label__SPOCK It is logical that we must reproduce the conditions that brought us here. Two novas must occupy the same space in both universes in order to create a gateway for us to travel through. One star dying in our universe, and one being born here would recreate the correct conditions. 
__label__SPOCK It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered and intelligent. 
__label__SPOCK A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.
__label__SPOCK All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice. 
__label__SPOCK Security teams report no sign of the alien on this deck, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps, but there are logical applications. The key question is, how long does it take them to recharge? They will probably attack us again as soon as they are back up to power. And they will probably begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating the same trick. They want Cyrano Jones very badly. 
__label__SPOCK If Mister Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on momentarily. (Uhura is just stirring on the floor) Are you all right, Lieutenant? 
__label__SPOCK Thanks Jim. It's good to have a friend like you. 
__label__SPOCK It is possible, but the rewiring of the power leads is complex and time-consuming. 
__label__SPOCK I doubt we'll be able to do so without being seen, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Then it is not a zookeeper. 
__label__SPOCK Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command. 
__label__SPOCK From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world. From Asia through the Middle East. 
__label__SPOCK I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed. 
__label__SPOCK I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time.
__label__SPOCK We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill. 
__label__SPOCK Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons.
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain? Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK You mentioned dikironium, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are being watched. 
__label__SPOCK Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body, Captain. However. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently our brains are also working in reverse, Captain, so we can now understand her language. That is why the ship seems to be operating in the reverse to us. 
__label__SPOCK It would appear so, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We've broken free and heading back. 
__label__SPOCK Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps more, Doctor. If planet annihilation is part of this thing's nature, it might seek them out as instinctively as an amoeba seeks out food. It may not consume only planets, but also stars. We do not know yet whether it has any selective ability, but it could be a thread to every planet in our galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK I see him, Ensign. I see him. Now, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, it could adversely affect our mission. 
__label__SPOCK I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life. 
__label__SPOCK Put it on the screen. 
__label__SPOCK I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors indicate the epicentre of the quake was in the north polar seas, Captain, a totally uninhabited area. 
__label__SPOCK The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely incredible.  
__label__SPOCK You built this, Mister Cochrane? 
__label__SPOCK Standard procedure, Captain? (Kirk nods) Mister Sulu, you will programme phaser barrage on Halkan cities. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations. 
__label__SPOCK What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, sensors are picking up an unidentified object travelling at an incredible speed, presently on collision course with the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Trouble in the Engineering core, sir. 
__label__SPOCK You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here. 
__label__SPOCK A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected. 
__label__SPOCK Wave bombardment reduced, but continuing. Deflector shields ineffective. 
__label__SPOCK Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science. 
__label__SPOCK Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web. 
__label__SPOCK I left him in the recreation room. 
__label__SPOCK Quite correct, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Computer? 
__label__SPOCK The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult to probe through it. 
__label__SPOCK Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful.
__label__SPOCK Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares? 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing audio-visual suggestion, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Oracle room. 
__label__SPOCK Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career. 
__label__SPOCK Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device. 
__label__SPOCK Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still can. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?
__label__SPOCK Did you enjoy it, Captain?
__label__SPOCK An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not come out. 
__label__SPOCK Full power, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Some kind of field effect, Captain. It will hit us in precisely four seconds. It produces a most remarkable (the weapon hits)
__label__SPOCK Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour.
__label__SPOCK They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant.
__label__SPOCK Yeoman, you will simply answer the question. 
__label__SPOCK That is a loss, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I (collapses) 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours. 
__label__SPOCK Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there? 
__label__SPOCK However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but definitely registering. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is.
__label__SPOCK I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK That may not be necessary. 
__label__SPOCK I beg your pardon? 
__label__SPOCK I think not. Your authority on this ship is extremely limited, Captain. The four of you will remain her in the Brig and in custody until I discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here.
__label__SPOCK Enterprise, Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would dictate that  KIRK: No, I'm playing intuition. Mister Chekov, compute a course for Tychos star system. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK There could be many reasons why we did not. 
__label__SPOCK A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us.
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK Unusual that such a lake would exist under these planetary conditions. 
__label__SPOCK Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper. 
__label__SPOCK Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven. 
__label__SPOCK Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. 
__label__SPOCK That description is not scientifically accurate. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature. 
__label__SPOCK Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock.
__label__SPOCK It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered having it removed?
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sure we all understand that, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Doctor. Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask. 
__label__SPOCK Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder? 
__label__SPOCK You're planning something, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room. 
__label__SPOCK I assure you I am quite sane. 
__label__SPOCK I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But what people created this? Are there any representatives here? 
__label__SPOCK I cannot say. The Klingon found near the dilithium vault knew nothing specific. But there is some kind of sabotage in the offing. 
__label__SPOCK And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the centre of the time disturbance. 
__label__SPOCK The end of life. Murderers. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it  KIRK: We'll have to kill them. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far.
__label__SPOCK Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified. 
__label__SPOCK You were injured? 
__label__SPOCK His name was Adam. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared. 
__label__SPOCK Unable to locate the source of radiation. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you. 
__label__SPOCK All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level. 
__label__SPOCK Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it? 
__label__SPOCK Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here. The only reasonable explanation would be a war.
__label__SPOCK Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion plates. 
__label__SPOCK Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad.
__label__SPOCK Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get. 
__label__SPOCK T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place. 
__label__SPOCK Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A. 
__label__SPOCK Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several weeks. 
__label__SPOCK Quite possible and logical. 
__label__SPOCK A most difficult decision, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you Earthmen enjoy gambling. No matter how carefully one computes the odds of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk. 
__label__SPOCK Yes.
__label__SPOCK Now. this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour. 
__label__SPOCK You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it. 
__label__SPOCK Your method of communication  AGMAR: A voder, or translator. Most efficient. (the medallion) 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK It's killing the captain!
__label__SPOCK Verified, Captain. We have seven days.
__label__SPOCK Probability point nine nine seven, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK That implies there are intelligent life forms on Argo. 
__label__SPOCK Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
__label__SPOCK You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics. 
__label__SPOCK Eleven point six three zero. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them. 
__label__SPOCK No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering. Someone just closed that line. 
__label__SPOCK Or something did.
__label__SPOCK Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask that question.
__label__SPOCK Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian. 
__label__SPOCK You propose the same environment necessarily prompts the same evolution? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Boma? 
__label__SPOCK Deck twelve. 
__label__SPOCK Nor upset? 
__label__SPOCK That too is a possibility. 
__label__SPOCK Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant. 
__label__SPOCK That is very considerate of you, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course. 
__label__SPOCK And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, speed is of the essence. 
__label__SPOCK I can't do that, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK He was aware of what might happen when he went. 
__label__SPOCK We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker. 
__label__SPOCK Lazarus. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. 
__label__SPOCK It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest we all concentrate on the medical kit. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed? 
__label__SPOCK We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun. 
__label__SPOCK I believe that is the correct Earth term. 
__label__SPOCK The trail is becoming fainter, Captain. I recommend we reduce speed to accommodate our sensors. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, change course. Seven zero mark two one. 
__label__SPOCK The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The father of all we became.
__label__SPOCK Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct approach? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there is a chance  KIRK: I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back with the information. I'll be right there. Scotty, energise transporter.
__label__SPOCK Ship's chronometers are also running backward. The flow of time is reversed in this universe. The longer we stay here, the younger we will become. 
__label__SPOCK This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.
__label__SPOCK It should. 
__label__SPOCK At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Then the passengers, or builders, are dead. 
__label__SPOCK A possibility. 
__label__SPOCK The le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight. 
__label__SPOCK Right. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you mind? 
__label__SPOCK Magnification factor twelve, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK No, you're not, for she is not. 
__label__SPOCK Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course laid in. 
__label__SPOCK Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor. Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK You are a Vulcan. What is the logical thing to do? 
__label__SPOCK Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking place on this planet for at least several centuries. 
__label__SPOCK None worth reporting, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK She is an alien. The configurations of her brain are different. It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Do you still feel anger toward Parmen? 
__label__SPOCK Lonely.
__label__SPOCK But it has happened, Doctor.
__label__SPOCK The Treaty of Sirius does not permit them any weapons at all, beyond police vessels. Obviously, the treaty has been broken. 
__label__SPOCK Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? 
__label__SPOCK Spock out.
__label__SPOCK I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational. 
__label__SPOCK Come, Doctor, back to bed. 
__label__SPOCK Red alert! Red alert! 
__label__SPOCK You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them. 
__label__SPOCK I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians. 
__label__SPOCK All station personnel are dead.
__label__SPOCK Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year or so. 
__label__SPOCK Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart  KIRK: They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtator works. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I call them ears. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you took a big chance. 
__label__SPOCK Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size.
__label__SPOCK Second vessel power supply out. Crew unharmed. They should be able to repair the ship in a few days. 
__label__SPOCK Not very likely, Ensign. 
__label__SPOCK Who is Landru? 
__label__SPOCK A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both. We will function as one being. 
__label__SPOCK It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time. 
__label__SPOCK A second ship has appeared. (another one decloaks) Correction, there are now three. We are surrounded. 
__label__SPOCK (sitting up) I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon.
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist.
__label__SPOCK Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no ill effects. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out. 
__label__SPOCK Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down? 
__label__SPOCK I was merely stating a fact, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness. 
__label__SPOCK An astute medical observation, Doctor, if we can believe this information. Tricorder readings indicate there is a body interred here.
__label__SPOCK I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to see that report. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water. Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK That should prove interesting. 
__label__SPOCK You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.
__label__SPOCK Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error. 
__label__SPOCK Confirmed. 
__label__SPOCK At least one solar day. 
__label__SPOCK He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous. 
__label__SPOCK The Captain and all of the crew members are incapacitated. The plague is aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Position, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK What is it you want of us? 
__label__SPOCK What happened? 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
__label__SPOCK Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels. 
__label__SPOCK That is an order, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise log. First officer Spock, acting captain. I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe into Van Gelder's tortured mind.
__label__SPOCK If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy. I do not want to command the Enterprise, but if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans. 
__label__SPOCK Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and they'll be able to leave orbit. 
__label__SPOCK No doubt, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative. 
__label__SPOCK The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman? 
__label__SPOCK I believe that I can. (Kirks stops him as women walks past) The writing is definitely Fabrini, Captain. I recognise it. 
__label__SPOCK He played most illogically. His next move should have been the rook. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK I believe we can attempt the course correction, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility, Doctor. At the moment, they are your top priority. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, just come with me, please. 
__label__SPOCK The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put the questions. 
__label__SPOCK This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.
__label__SPOCK My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron. 
__label__SPOCK I can guarantee it. 
__label__SPOCK One is the beginning. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is anything wrong? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen. 
__label__SPOCK And as little freedom. 
__label__SPOCK Rig for simultaneous firing, Mister Sulu. Commence simultaneous bombardment. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate? 
__label__SPOCK My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need for departure is even more immediate. 
__label__SPOCK Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point two five  [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface. 
__label__SPOCK Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately. 
__label__SPOCK Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left. 
__label__SPOCK Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion. 
__label__SPOCK There is some human blood in my family line. It is not fatal.
__label__SPOCK What kind? Personnel? Cargo? 
__label__SPOCK I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. It's made no moves against you? 
__label__SPOCK They are safe because we are now exhibits in a zoo. 
__label__SPOCK Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no problems.
__label__SPOCK About your double, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Keep trying.
__label__SPOCK Turbo elevators inoperative. Jammed, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my stomach. Other than that, I am quite well. 
__label__SPOCK Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher.
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits. 
__label__SPOCK Ingenious. 
__label__SPOCK I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK The dead star is directly ahead, Captain, twelve degrees south of galactic plane. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow. 
__label__SPOCK I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position. So far. 
__label__SPOCK Instruments register only those things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet, you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. I want to know why. 
__label__SPOCK That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory. 
__label__SPOCK Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale. 
__label__SPOCK At a speed that should be impossible to achieve. Something on the order of warp thirty six. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate? 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see. 
__label__SPOCK Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative. 
__label__SPOCK If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in pure form. 
__label__SPOCK A small thing which holds us all. 
__label__SPOCK It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down. 
__label__SPOCK I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise term. Induced by an outside force. 
__label__SPOCK Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen. 
__label__SPOCK Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
__label__SPOCK The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control. 
__label__SPOCK They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain. (Kirk stretches and groans) Something wrong?
__label__SPOCK Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform.
__label__SPOCK I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same instant as Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK We do pride ourselves on our logic. 
__label__SPOCK An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship  KIRK: I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't feel it safe, Spock.
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive. 
__label__SPOCK This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, were you inside this structure? 
__label__SPOCK Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are one. I feel what you feel. I know what you know. 
__label__SPOCK You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural condition of this individual? 
__label__SPOCK True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination.
__label__SPOCK Yes. very well, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us. 
__label__SPOCK That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet. 
__label__SPOCK No, Jim! 
__label__SPOCK Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter puberty, contract the disease? 
__label__SPOCK The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It resembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths.
__label__SPOCK That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do. 
__label__SPOCK This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you? 
__label__SPOCK Sickbay? 
__label__SPOCK Whom do you serve now? 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat. 
__label__SPOCK That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently, Captain, so are we. 
__label__SPOCK Ad infinitum, perhaps, considering distance between atoms is relatively as great as between stars. 
__label__SPOCK This is very curious, Captain. It computes as a strange combination of matter and energy. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time. 
__label__SPOCK Are you aware that Harry Mudd is tricking you via an illusion? 
__label__SPOCK Precisely.
__label__SPOCK It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced.
__label__SPOCK Come on, Boma. 
__label__SPOCK Take no action, Mister Hansen.
__label__SPOCK I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too disciplined once you've made up your mind. But Doctor McCoy has a plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft. You may not tell me what I want to know, but he will. 
__label__SPOCK By our standards today, with primitive atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels  [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is  KIRK: Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us.
__label__SPOCK May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our destination. 
__label__SPOCK They do have one redeeming characteristic. 
__label__SPOCK The rest?
__label__SPOCK Yes, quite all right, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps not. There is the null setting. It seems to do nothing.
__label__SPOCK Apparently they were exposed to a frightening geological disaster. Such hardship induces savagery and violence. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience. How did you know? 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect? 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest? 
__label__SPOCK Empty. 
__label__SPOCK Irrelevant, since we are here. 
__label__SPOCK Unidentified. It's extremely faint and diffused. Captain, I suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect. 
__label__SPOCK If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding. 
__label__SPOCK What are you doing to her? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately.
__label__SPOCK It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience. 
__label__SPOCK Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation will rise up to battle the Skorr. 
__label__SPOCK It does resemble a summons. 
__label__SPOCK Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous.
__label__SPOCK B deck, in or near Engineering. 
__label__SPOCK Computer read-out. 
__label__SPOCK And no doubt they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for ten thousand years. 
__label__SPOCK Chess.
__label__SPOCK I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms. 
__label__SPOCK As a Vulcan, I age the slowest. I will be capable of assuming command longer than anyone else. But even I will become too young to know what to do. 
__label__SPOCK It is time. 
__label__SPOCK Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this.
__label__SPOCK It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings. 
__label__SPOCK If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat. 
__label__SPOCK That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.  M'BENGA: Please, release her. 
__label__SPOCK There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down a large contingent. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course be very crude. 
__label__SPOCK It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life indiscriminately,  GAETANO: The majority. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I believe (notices, and wakes him gently) Captain.
__label__SPOCK (Barely audible over static) The nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to interior irritation. I believe sufficient charge of (inaudible) could destroy the organism.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature, Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched.
__label__SPOCK Rizzo's alive, barely. 
__label__SPOCK No analysis due to insufficient information. 
__label__SPOCK Also logical, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK There is no alternative. 
__label__SPOCK Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful. 
__label__SPOCK Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight.
__label__SPOCK I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir.
__label__SPOCK Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past episode or experience they all have in common. 
__label__SPOCK Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result  OXMYX: The most co-operative man in this world is a dead man. And if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to be co-operatin'. 
__label__SPOCK Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records. 
__label__SPOCK It was necessary. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the non-interference Directive. 
__label__SPOCK Not precisely. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium. 
__label__SPOCK It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it is pursuing us. (The viewscreen now shows it head-on. A round opening with a small sun partway down the gullet.) 
__label__SPOCK Activate deflectors. 
__label__SPOCK To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain the importance of going to Talos Four.
__label__SPOCK The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose their mates? Haven't you wondered? 
__label__SPOCK There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology.
__label__SPOCK The Excalibur, a direct hit. 
__label__SPOCK The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact. 
__label__SPOCK There are endless, Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a practical invisibility screen. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. Lock in on my communicator signal. Your Excellency, please do not interfere. I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I would assume so. 
__label__SPOCK Something wrong? 
__label__SPOCK Captain? Captain Kirk? 
__label__SPOCK Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal. 
__label__SPOCK I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find the Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around me. See? (to Chapel) Take the hypo from him. And inject him with it. 
__label__SPOCK In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you. 
__label__SPOCK No, but the method is fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK If you could remember your exact words, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The creature is in this area. I'll take a lifeform reading. 
__label__SPOCK This resembles ancient medical symbols, Captain. The torso indicates mutation. 
__label__SPOCK If you'll excuse me.  (Spock leaves. Charlie melts the white chess pieces.) 
__label__SPOCK Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control. 
__label__SPOCK We're back to normal time, Captain.
__label__SPOCK My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances. 
__label__SPOCK Welcome home, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It has landed. Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life at all, either humanoid nor animal. 
__label__SPOCK A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees, elevation four degrees. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. At present, I am rather heavily  (He quickly shuts and hides his communicator as the door opens, and the Commander enters. She is wearing a figure hugging dress.) 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions. You now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task. 
__label__SPOCK The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain. 
__label__SPOCK There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations. 
__label__SPOCK Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite impossible. 
__label__SPOCK And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me. 
__label__SPOCK Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the last digit the value of pi. 
__label__SPOCK Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures. 
__label__SPOCK They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir.
__label__SPOCK Precisely, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible. 
__label__SPOCK The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction. 
__label__SPOCK Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it.
__label__SPOCK That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the substance. 
__label__SPOCK No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this. 
__label__SPOCK Deflectors full intensity. 
__label__SPOCK Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation. 
__label__SPOCK It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No standard references apply. 
__label__SPOCK This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one, and they'll all go. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago. They wore clothing similar to ours. Have you heard of such men? 
__label__SPOCK It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. 
__label__SPOCK That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
__label__SPOCK The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture. 
__label__SPOCK Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day. Repairs proceeding on transporter and communications. 
__label__SPOCK How is the power transmitted? 
__label__SPOCK I am formulating a theory, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It will have to do, Mister Scott. (door buzzer) Come. 
__label__SPOCK Co-ordinates. 
__label__SPOCK Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders. Spock out. 
__label__SPOCK That hardly seems likely. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion.
__label__SPOCK Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden? 
__label__SPOCK I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word. 
__label__SPOCK Life support is still operating. I would say that the installation is incomplete. 
__label__SPOCK I see. 
__label__SPOCK I understand, Doctor. I'm sure the Captain would simply have said forget it, Bones. 
__label__SPOCK We aren't going to go, to be certain?
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK It will make a strange entry in the library banks. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Doctor. The young lady did show a marked preference for your company. 
__label__SPOCK Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
__label__SPOCK Negative.
__label__SPOCK If so, you wear your age very well. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body. 
__label__SPOCK It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one. 
__label__SPOCK The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy. 
__label__SPOCK We go together or not at all. 
__label__SPOCK He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him.
__label__SPOCK May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any objections? 
__label__SPOCK Apparently alive. We cannot be sure. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, that could be exactly what they want us to do. Tow the robot and limit our available power. We're carrying the extra mass of the first ship's cargo, and now we have the second one in tow. That requires a great deal of power we won't be able to use in battle. 
__label__SPOCK An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But completely inoperative. (into communicator) Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Elements unknown in our periodic tables, Captain. I'm of the opinion this cloud has come from outside our galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, your lack of scientific interest is amazing. 
__label__SPOCK Power surge? 
__label__SPOCK And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make such a decision only for myself. 
__label__SPOCK Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear section C4 and C5. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty thousand kilometres. 
__label__SPOCK Now. 
__label__SPOCK And it is not yet our time. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I must assume command. You are no longer able to command the Enterprise.
__label__SPOCK Are you all right, Jim?
__label__SPOCK I assume that's a rhetorical question, Captain, not requiring an answer. 
__label__SPOCK I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a Starbase. 
__label__SPOCK It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation techniques. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any of us interfere  (Charlie enters under guard) 
__label__SPOCK None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves? 
__label__SPOCK None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I'll return to my station now. 
__label__SPOCK (on biobed) It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me.
__label__SPOCK Is there anything you need to isolate the cause? 
__label__SPOCK No use, Captain. Some sort of interference has been set up. 
__label__SPOCK A very long and complicated story, Lieutenant. Notify the transporter room, Two to beam up, these co-ordinates.
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, how much power do we have left in the ship's batteries? 
__label__SPOCK It would never occur to me, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the water is too pure. 
__label__SPOCK There's nothing we can do about it. 
__label__SPOCK That is an outstandingly stupid idea. I'm sorry. The drug. I simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature. If they have one. 
__label__SPOCK (sitting up and grabbing McCoy's arm) Why did the captain let me live? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger.
__label__SPOCK Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate. 
__label__SPOCK May I help you record his confession, Nurse? 
__label__SPOCK Captain Koloth is quite a marksman. 
__label__SPOCK In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over. Checkmate.
__label__SPOCK Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down.
__label__SPOCK Source of radiation, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Try to understand your son, Sarek of Vulcan. It will be repayment enough for me. 
__label__SPOCK We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A. 
__label__SPOCK Getting something from the recorder now. 
__label__SPOCK I'm getting strange readings from the planet surface, Captain. Some sort of power field down there.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature. 
__label__SPOCK And how long can we hold it? 
__label__SPOCK Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to your left. 
__label__SPOCK I am not capable of that emotion. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service. 
__label__SPOCK Hit on the Lexington. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew. 
__label__SPOCK You were correct in your feel. The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I am only a Vulcan. There are limits. 
__label__SPOCK Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment. 
__label__SPOCK I thought you might. 
__label__SPOCK We have tried. 
__label__SPOCK Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity, narrow beam. I want to split that fissure wide open. 
__label__SPOCK (in pain) Captain, go. I. You must destroy the  KIRK: What is it? 
__label__SPOCK Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment. The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we cannot scan it. Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates. They must be provided by Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK The walls are not climbable. 
__label__SPOCK They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps you needed the rest. We are on course through the Neutral Zone, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Bailey. All engines stop. Sound the alert.
__label__SPOCK Captain! 
__label__SPOCK Do not risk the ship further on my behalf. 
__label__SPOCK This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. There seems to be a total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora. 
__label__SPOCK Jim, he's not responsible. 
__label__SPOCK I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma. 
__label__SPOCK Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation. 
__label__SPOCK I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic. 
__label__SPOCK The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago. 
__label__SPOCK The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors. 
__label__SPOCK You sound bitter, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end and soon. 
__label__SPOCK Consider all you could learn from the many species you might entertain without travelling the galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might  GALLOWAY [OC]: Bridge, Security. Alert, alert! 
__label__SPOCK Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative. 
__label__SPOCK Really, Captain, my modesty  KIRK: Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock. I suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time. 
__label__SPOCK Ready. (beams them out) 
__label__SPOCK A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody. 
__label__SPOCK That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy? 
__label__SPOCK Temperature one hundred eleven degrees and rising. 
__label__SPOCK That we have yet to ascertain. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov? 
__label__SPOCK He would have had to go through here to escape. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. But philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here. 
__label__SPOCK There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have. 
__label__SPOCK The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the secondary level. 
__label__SPOCK I'll have you checkmated your next move. 
__label__SPOCK Please keep me fully advised. Spock out. He was in the transporter room. Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left. Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set. 
__label__SPOCK Decidedly non-lethal, however. 
__label__SPOCK You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room. 
__label__SPOCK Screen on, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Standing by, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. The dysfunction is more severe than I thought.
__label__SPOCK If I can be of assistance, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must master it. I must control. 
__label__SPOCK Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, use the magic you know. Believe. 
__label__SPOCK Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible to predict, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Forty, thirty. 
__label__SPOCK Oh? 
__label__SPOCK Negative. 
__label__SPOCK What is it in you humans  SCOTT: Never mind. 
__label__SPOCK Good. I have questions to ask her. 
__label__SPOCK Excellent, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Ready when you are, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves  KIRK: A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Needed on the bridge, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known information. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place. I find it extremely interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba. 
__label__SPOCK You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Of course. I shall obey your restrictions. 
__label__SPOCK We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you? 
__label__SPOCK Try to maintain position Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence.
__label__SPOCK All research lines negative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK That is always my intention, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon? 
__label__SPOCK Crewman, report to the lab!
__label__SPOCK Insufficient mass, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside. 
__label__SPOCK I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red. 
__label__SPOCK Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It seems a logical assumption, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Then you are both here, in the one body? 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. His act warrants death. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Bridge. 
__label__SPOCK According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful. 
__label__SPOCK Computers show no immediate information on the word terratin. 
__label__SPOCK The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain. 
__label__SPOCK Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you. 
__label__SPOCK Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan? 
__label__SPOCK The power source we detected is in this building, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Our minds are one. 
__label__SPOCK But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we located, but not populated. We should not be observed. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the security guards. 
__label__SPOCK We have outrun it, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration is unfamiliar. Most unusual. 
__label__SPOCK Force field is now off, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly. 
__label__SPOCK You do not even know what the action is going to be. 
__label__SPOCK No! No! (he sits up) 
__label__SPOCK Bad enough. 
__label__SPOCK Artificial gravity is in effect here, Captain. Both air and gravity within two points of Earth normal. 
__label__SPOCK Merely an observation, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the base. It was necessary to bring him along. 
__label__SPOCK These aborigines appear to be in a late primitive state.
__label__SPOCK (to McCoy) Get some security people and follow me down.
__label__SPOCK Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power. 
__label__SPOCK Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project. 
__label__SPOCK How long were we gone? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, they're using  (All over the ship, people fall to the floor)
__label__SPOCK This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you controlled through this device? 
__label__SPOCK I cannot tell you how impressed I am by your splendid spirit of co-operation. 
__label__SPOCK Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape without firing. 
__label__SPOCK Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do you understand? 
__label__SPOCK And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon.
__label__SPOCK Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet. 
__label__SPOCK We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the Captain alive. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, do you verify? 
__label__SPOCK Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused. 
__label__SPOCK Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
__label__SPOCK I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive.
__label__SPOCK Nor I a work of art, madam. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Right now. 
__label__SPOCK It is a force globe, but one that is flexible enough to absorb any force. I cannot explain it. Clearly we cannot escape by simply fleeing. Sensors indicate we at now being probed. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid. 
__label__SPOCK You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not words. They are musical notes. 
__label__SPOCK I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. 
__label__SPOCK Your automatic setting is laid in, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. Question. Why are we unable to communicate with crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura? 
__label__SPOCK Confirmed, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of mine. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, this is quite unprecedented. Notice the fracturing is spiro-form, similar to long chain molecules. 
__label__SPOCK We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick. 
__label__SPOCK It has to do with biology. 
__label__SPOCK If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, Doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous. We are therefore forced to trust Mister Oxmyx.
__label__SPOCK Lock on to secondary city. 
__label__SPOCK The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease. 
__label__SPOCK Commodore, I suggest  DECKER: Kirk pulled us out of there by distracting it. Now it's our turn. Fire phasers. (they do) We did it! Hard about. Give me some distance. 
__label__SPOCK The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify them this way. Very important. 
__label__SPOCK It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men. I assume they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here. 
__label__SPOCK Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger.
__label__SPOCK Zero two zero. 
__label__SPOCK The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Jim. No. Captain. We're both reacting to the drug. The love potion. 
__label__SPOCK One small thing was changed this time. A pet died. 
__label__SPOCK The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.
__label__SPOCK I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes. 
__label__SPOCK Where is Reger? 
__label__SPOCK Will you check your automatic scanner, please? 
__label__SPOCK I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea. 
__label__SPOCK Possible. Very possible. 
__label__SPOCK I'll prepare the formula, Sargon. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. The result of stress? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott  [Crawlway]
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Many of us are on the thing near you now. Do not consume it. 
__label__SPOCK Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a similar launch by other powers. 
__label__SPOCK Ready for interphase in twenty seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you almost make me believe in luck. 
__label__SPOCK We're picking up an object, sir. Much larger, coming toward us.
__label__SPOCK It was the only choice possible. You would not respect any other. 
__label__SPOCK I resist that suggestion, Commodore. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted. They probably don't have the strength for a prolonged battle now. 
__label__SPOCK Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters. It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel. What is your present location?
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. Transporter Room. Beam damage control party aboard. 
__label__SPOCK It's range cannot be guaranteed. How will we pinpoint you for return in case it fails? 
__label__SPOCK You will have that opportunity. 
__label__SPOCK Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps not in a way we understand. I keep receiving impressions. 
__label__SPOCK He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I found him. 
__label__SPOCK Am I intruding, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK We aren't going to go, to be certain?
__label__SPOCK Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist. 
__label__SPOCK I believe the phrase was, 'our young saved your lives once.'  KIRK: Yes, and they didn't seem to approve. The answer appears to be in that direction, Spock. 
__label__SPOCK I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this? 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the conn. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud. 
__label__SPOCK Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.
__label__SPOCK Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures. Mister Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields. 
__label__SPOCK Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments. 
__label__SPOCK Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers.
__label__SPOCK So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them. 
__label__SPOCK Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you invite death? 
__label__SPOCK Only data is from early exploration. Planet is listed as Class M, core molten, mantle and crust entirely crystalline. 
__label__SPOCK None, Captain. Insufficient data. 
__label__SPOCK It would appear that the entity wants us alive. 
__label__SPOCK Well, I believe it's safe, (cough) safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions. 
__label__SPOCK Understood, Captain. Transporter room. 
__label__SPOCK Are you forgetting Kzinti females are dumb animals? In an emergency the Kzinti may forget a human female is an intelligent creature. 
__label__SPOCK Transporter, stand by. 
__label__SPOCK His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I thought the plan  OTHER KIRK: I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock.
__label__SPOCK Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being there. It is a machine, nothing more. 
__label__SPOCK Why should you fear it? 
__label__SPOCK Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi Germany. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the enemy ship is drifting, totally disabled. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1. 
__label__SPOCK You will recall we recognised at least two species from vastly different planets. The environment did not appear natural to this planet. A technology this advanced could easily travel to other star systems to collect specimens. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will then seal using the tri-laser connector. 
__label__SPOCK But that is not what we requested. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, I waive counsel. Further, I waive rights to this hearing and request immediate court-martial.
__label__SPOCK Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative? 
__label__SPOCK If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean. 
__label__SPOCK But you made mistakes, used your powers  MEGAN: And burned for it. Burned! 
__label__SPOCK It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you. 
__label__SPOCK He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed back faster. He didn't become as weak. 
__label__SPOCK Captain.
__label__SPOCK A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves. It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be extremely sophisticated. 
__label__SPOCK And you in yours, Commander Thelin. 
__label__SPOCK It is a long journey across the desert. There are many dangers.
__label__SPOCK Eleven years, four months, five days.
__label__SPOCK Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.
__label__SPOCK Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal. 
__label__SPOCK Is it ego, or something else? 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, you will stand trial, you will find out, after you've found and antidote for the plague which is about to kill everyone aboard the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only your urging her on caused her to continue. 
__label__SPOCK Of course. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area. 
__label__SPOCK Is there any clue to its location? 
__label__SPOCK Ready, Captain. Quite crude. Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Negative star mass. Spectra analysis, imploded matter, but every reading on it is negative. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position. This conduct must be reported. 
__label__SPOCK They did fail to indicate the large marine creature that attacked us. Perhaps the readings are incomplete, blocked by underwater pressure forces. Oceans are less turbulent at greater depth. Such conditions would be more suitable to intelligent forms. 
__label__SPOCK The sensors are still not registering normally, sir. But I would venture the theory it has something to do with the many ship disappearances in this area. 
__label__SPOCK Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself. 
__label__SPOCK What would you have me say, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK The communicator, concentrate on the communicator. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as these might be misinterpreted. 
__label__SPOCK Wood rubbing on some kind of leather. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. A doctor should have more pride. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently a life form which previous surveys have not recorded.
__label__SPOCK Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous insanity.
__label__SPOCK Then your sympathies were with  KHAN: You are an excellent tactician, Captain. You let your second in command attack while you sit and watch for weakness. 
__label__SPOCK You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes. 
__label__SPOCK That unit is a woman. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Tracey's reserve belt packs. Empty. Found among the remains of several hundred Yang bodies. 
__label__SPOCK He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent.
__label__SPOCK Scan all other banks. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism. 
__label__SPOCK Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was Garrovick. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling behind. 
__label__SPOCK Of course. Our Federation scientists were more correct than they realised. In order to function, the galactic creation point must extend through space, time, into another dimension where the logic of things is totally different. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Van Gelder, Captain. No mistake. There's a full ID tape on him.
__label__SPOCK Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference. 
__label__SPOCK Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve closure? 
__label__SPOCK Logical. Flawlessly logical. 
__label__SPOCK I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the Ambassador. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form. 
__label__SPOCK I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement. 
__label__SPOCK This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.
__label__SPOCK All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
__label__SPOCK Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked. 
__label__SPOCK Quite clear, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, Doctor.
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the ship. 
__label__SPOCK To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions? 
__label__SPOCK Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters  KIRK: I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The Klingon ship. 
__label__SPOCK Get into the ship! Immediate lift off! 
__label__SPOCK Really, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time.
__label__SPOCK The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for your safety. (to Sulu's replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below. 
__label__SPOCK We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man. 
__label__SPOCK But it does look promising. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness. 
__label__SPOCK Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all. 
__label__SPOCK By observation alone, it appears they hit an invisible force field. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. I can't seem to get through, Captain. They appear too involved with each other. 
__label__SPOCK I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears to be primarily mental. 
__label__SPOCK This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch.
__label__SPOCK Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency. Captain, you're looking well. Evidently Starfleet's analysis was correct. 
__label__SPOCK I believe we should, Jim.
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question. 
__label__SPOCK What we've just seen is not real. 
__label__SPOCK You've got to pull him through. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. 
__label__SPOCK The missing pump wasn't taken by accident.
__label__SPOCK What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled.
__label__SPOCK How are you doing, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK I do not remember everything. There is a vague memory from a child's point of view, but the details are not clear. 
__label__SPOCK I would suggest Doctor Keniclius remain on Phylos with my duplicate. The concerted efforts of both scientists may yet achieve a rebirth of the Phylosian civilisation and enable them to contribute to the Federation. 
__label__SPOCK Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their original position. That intervening high ground. 
__label__SPOCK Such a diversion would be of short duration, Captain. And I must point out, the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape. 
__label__SPOCK I was unable to accept. My life is here. 
__label__SPOCK The Captain, myself, and the records officer. 
__label__SPOCK Only a very slight chance it would work. 
__label__SPOCK As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place. 
__label__SPOCK The situation between my father and myself has not changed. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, I value your intelligence, but we may be able to seize an opportunity to escape if the Kzinti believe you have none. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries.
__label__SPOCK Nothing else could've caused this, Captain. At least nothing that has happened here. 
__label__SPOCK I can answer none of your questions at this time. 
__label__SPOCK You received my signal, Mister Scott.
__label__SPOCK Chekov! Chekov! 
__label__SPOCK Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions. 
__label__SPOCK Unless the situation changes radically, yes. 
__label__SPOCK Eight seven five. 
__label__SPOCK She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power. Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel. It is, therefore, self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on. 
__label__SPOCK Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die. 
__label__SPOCK The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences.
__label__SPOCK It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora.
__label__SPOCK No change, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A strong jump on all wavelengths. 
__label__SPOCK Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals. 
__label__SPOCK Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Our reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We respectfully ask permission to inquire further  KIRK: Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise. Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the flower is not the only thing on board that is growing younger. 
__label__SPOCK Radiation passing the tolerance level, entering lethal zone.
__label__SPOCK Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, of course, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies. According to my calculations  [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.
__label__SPOCK There is no library, Captain, at least not that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff. 
__label__SPOCK Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it, or him. 
__label__SPOCK The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness.  Y SPOCK: Do you think I'll ever be able to do that neck pinch as well as you? 
__label__SPOCK My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister Boma. 
__label__SPOCK Telepathy? 
__label__SPOCK Bridge to Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays. 
__label__SPOCK Are you sure there is no possibility you made an error? 
__label__SPOCK Astonishment. 
__label__SPOCK How did you know this lady was coming aboard? 
__label__SPOCK Spock here.
__label__SPOCK Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the approaching vessel? 
__label__SPOCK Just the facts, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Companion, you do not have the power to create life. 
__label__SPOCK Clear, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I suspected he might not wish to return with us. 
__label__SPOCK By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal.
__label__SPOCK Fifteen seconds. 
__label__SPOCK No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors. 
__label__SPOCK I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are real. 
__label__SPOCK Now. 
__label__SPOCK The child's regent? 
__label__SPOCK I have never computed them, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK One uses the resources at hand, Captain. Watch now. (stands in the pentangle) I will attempt to move a Vulcan chess piece magically.
__label__SPOCK Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their purpose. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life. 
__label__SPOCK There is, of course, no escape for them, sir. 
__label__SPOCK What is it? 
__label__SPOCK You've met her before, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, why should I aim at such a structure? 
__label__SPOCK Transporter, stand by. 
__label__SPOCK I know all about them. 
__label__SPOCK We came to think to you. You consumed us. You thought we were food. 
__label__SPOCK Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester.
__label__SPOCK Light reading is considered relaxing, Captain. My mother was particularly fond of Lewis Carroll's work. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. 
__label__SPOCK There's another factor, Captain. The transporter is not working at one hundred percent efficiency. 
__label__SPOCK We're in the hands of an adolescent.
__label__SPOCK Force field of some kind. 
__label__SPOCK Amazing in this culture. 
__label__SPOCK Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
__label__SPOCK SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty seven, commanded by. Jim, I believe you knew him. Captain R M Merik. 
__label__SPOCK Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds. 
__label__SPOCK The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you. 
__label__SPOCK Easy, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion, promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be beautiful. 
__label__SPOCK Communicators, Captain, they're gone. 
__label__SPOCK Further instructions? 
__label__SPOCK Evasive action will not be effective, Captain. The force globe limits our manoeuvreing. 
__label__SPOCK He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a drink, Jim. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow, one on the stern. Distance, two hundred thousand kilometres and closing. 
__label__SPOCK Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a UFO. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. status report. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be done.
__label__SPOCK The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Evasive maneuvers, Mister Sulu.
__label__SPOCK Correct, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK May I inquire as to our course, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital? 
__label__SPOCK From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim. 
__label__SPOCK Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into. 
__label__SPOCK How many other names shall we call you? 
__label__SPOCK There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash. 
__label__SPOCK There would seem to be evidence to that effect. 
__label__SPOCK His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control? 
__label__SPOCK Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble.
__label__SPOCK I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty. 
__label__SPOCK You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you did. I got the same information. 
__label__SPOCK Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision. 
__label__SPOCK And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious.
__label__SPOCK Ready to beam up, Jim. 
__label__SPOCK I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge.
__label__SPOCK Not on this world. 
__label__SPOCK Freefall! 
__label__SPOCK Yes, that is true, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, quickly then. Terminal M3 red, lead to diode shunt A37.
__label__SPOCK Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states  MCCOY: To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when you know he's wrong! 
__label__SPOCK Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci's, they would be priceless. 
__label__SPOCK A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function. 
__label__SPOCK All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out the battery connections) Again! Again! 
__label__SPOCK Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please. 
__label__SPOCK Chart 14A, sir? 
__label__SPOCK Planet development is normal, Captain.
__label__SPOCK The women!
__label__SPOCK A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order. 
__label__SPOCK No, my lady Amanda. Any child has much to learn. My young cousin has a more difficult road to travel than others. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but  (An energy weapon blasts a hole in the wall near them) 
__label__SPOCK Christine. 
__label__SPOCK My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador. 
__label__SPOCK She evidently understood something. There are no guards to detain us.
__label__SPOCK The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide. 
__label__SPOCK (to McCoy) The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist. 
__label__SPOCK The code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, very well, thank you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. 
__label__SPOCK Illogical. We cannot destroy it. Therefore, we cannot save Rigel. We must transport the Captain and the others from the Constellation and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn Starfleet Command. 
__label__SPOCK Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I know that does not make much sense. 
__label__SPOCK Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The unanswered question is, the other what? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Good luck, sir. 
__label__SPOCK I may have found our focal point in time. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing, Captain. No contacts, no objects in any direction.
__label__SPOCK Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake? 
__label__SPOCK Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked up. 
__label__SPOCK Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe. 
__label__SPOCK Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. 
__label__SPOCK The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found us. 
__label__SPOCK Forty seconds, Captain. Thirty nine, thirty eight. 
__label__SPOCK I am ready. 
__label__SPOCK I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at will. 
__label__SPOCK You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it could be vanity. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard. 
__label__SPOCK I know the Captain. He is in  SHAW: Please instruct the witness not to speculate. 
__label__SPOCK He never even had a chance to fire, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Then it translates its findings into English. 
__label__SPOCK They are not within the confines of this solar system. 
__label__SPOCK I have no information on that, Captain. We are ready to leave orbit. 
__label__SPOCK I shall give it top priority. 
__label__SPOCK What did they do to you? 
__label__SPOCK There is no need. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. 
__label__SPOCK It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril. 
__label__SPOCK No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do. Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend is back. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command. 
__label__SPOCK Well, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution. 
__label__SPOCK Did l? I may have been mistaken. 
__label__SPOCK My pleasure, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself. 
__label__SPOCK Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement reading. 
__label__SPOCK Naturally, since he did not come from there. 
__label__SPOCK Our speed is now warp twenty, and the other ship will contact the nova in one minute fifty eight point three seconds. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to bring me along. 
__label__SPOCK I don't think so, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic. 
__label__SPOCK Ensign, warp seven. 
__label__SPOCK I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK She's becoming a woman.
__label__SPOCK I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error. 
__label__SPOCK Remarkable. Commander Bem is a colony creature. 
__label__SPOCK I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper  KIRK: Spock, just press the right button. 
__label__SPOCK Aye, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts. 
__label__SPOCK Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako? 
__label__SPOCK If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C. 
__label__SPOCK Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view, leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk? 
__label__SPOCK Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened.
__label__SPOCK Six, five, four three. 
__label__SPOCK It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
__label__SPOCK Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape  KIRK: Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected. 
__label__SPOCK They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of it.
__label__SPOCK That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take.
__label__SPOCK (hoarsely) No, I won't. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? Captain? Captain, are you able to respond? 
__label__SPOCK I do not see them. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Wallace, give him the shot. 
__label__SPOCK True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them.
__label__SPOCK He is. 
__label__SPOCK Which allowed no quarter, no captives. Nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication. Therefore, no human, Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other. Earth believes the Romulans to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Good work, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Status, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Your Excellency. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry. 
__label__SPOCK In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer. 
__label__SPOCK True. 
__label__SPOCK I wonder how humanity managed to survive. 
__label__SPOCK That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. 
__label__SPOCK Despoil? For what purpose? 
__label__SPOCK (enters) Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of Professor Starnes' tapes. 
__label__SPOCK He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd.
__label__SPOCK Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves. 
__label__SPOCK Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is. 
__label__SPOCK That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence. 
__label__SPOCK Your analysis seems logical. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area. 
__label__SPOCK Good. 
__label__SPOCK Crude but dangerous. 
__label__SPOCK It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness. 
__label__SPOCK If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive. 
__label__SPOCK Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game. 
__label__SPOCK Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it. 
__label__SPOCK It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead. 
__label__SPOCK Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose? 
__label__SPOCK Manual override is in control, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Not so far as we know. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK The streamers are a combination of koinoenergy, almost an ambiplasma with an unusually powerful attraction force. 
__label__SPOCK To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines. 
__label__SPOCK (examining a large globe from Vanderberg's desk) Mister Vanderberg, what is this? 
__label__SPOCK Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due. 
__label__SPOCK A man must also have the power. 
__label__SPOCK That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. 
__label__SPOCK How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits? 
__label__SPOCK That suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims. 
__label__SPOCK For what? 
__label__SPOCK To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available. Losira's. 
__label__SPOCK We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can cross-circuit this unit. 
__label__SPOCK Kill it. 
__label__SPOCK Fire. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we're receiving you. 
__label__SPOCK I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement. 
__label__SPOCK Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed. I do not intend to miss that  [Engineering]
__label__SPOCK And you are sure that this is the correct slide? 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Something is trying to get in. The field of interference is reacting against the magnetic flux lines, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed. I would estimate the odds  AMANDA: Please don't. 
__label__SPOCK He may indeed be dead. We do not know. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical approach. 
__label__SPOCK A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power and increasing, beginning to affect our communications.
__label__SPOCK Possible. I would have to have one to examine. 
__label__SPOCK Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are affected, Captain. I suggest  (A planet wobbles into view. and the men go all misty. The Enterprise enters orbit) 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Can you give us your present location, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Out of the question. 
__label__SPOCK Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. A very high order of workmanship, very ancient, generating great power. 
__label__SPOCK Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible.
__label__SPOCK It seems to gather strength from our phasers. In my opinion. 
__label__SPOCK We're heading back to the Neutral Zone. 
__label__SPOCK I can only describe it as hypergravity, Captain, more powerful than any we've ever encountered. It's dragging the Enterprise toward it. 
__label__SPOCK Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce.
__label__SPOCK There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further. 
__label__SPOCK Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence. 
__label__SPOCK No Federation contacts for over a year. 
__label__SPOCK Your deflector shield, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fifty years to go. 
__label__SPOCK By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test it, except in actual use. 
__label__SPOCK They appear to be as advanced beyond Earth civilisation as you are from a colony of ants. 
__label__SPOCK The boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon, does he not? 
__label__SPOCK He might be inclined to prepare a perfect one, Captain. But then again he may be telling the truth. 
__label__SPOCK It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that, Captain, and understand? 
__label__SPOCK Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up your gain?
__label__SPOCK What department? 
__label__SPOCK Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres. 
__label__SPOCK Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards.
__label__SPOCK Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine. (takes the bishop) Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not accept that, however. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to one. 
__label__SPOCK I shall try. 
__label__SPOCK I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong. 
__label__SPOCK According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time. 
__label__SPOCK Mischievous pranks, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Regulations require  KIRK: Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all along. First little excuse you get  SPOCK: Captain, I have not assumed command. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, on the viewscreen. 
__label__SPOCK Tractor beam, Captain. Something's grabbed us, hard.
__label__SPOCK On the other hand, notifying them may still save some small fraction of the population, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I do not recall clearly. I was very young. He called himself Selek. He was visiting us, but I never saw him after that. 
__label__SPOCK Bring us about. We'll investigate the Beta Lyrae system. 
__label__SPOCK Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds. 
__label__SPOCK On overload. (starts searching) 
__label__SPOCK No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir.
__label__SPOCK Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
__label__SPOCK Who is conducting the research? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago? (flash) Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control.
__label__SPOCK Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able  MCCOY: No arguments, Spock. Doctor's orders. 
__label__SPOCK And now they're gone. Is that what you mean? 
__label__SPOCK Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline. 
__label__SPOCK Any word from the Enterprise?
__label__SPOCK Give me a full report as soon as possible, please. Spock out. Mister Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction. 
__label__SPOCK Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? 
__label__SPOCK There's no question about his guilt, Captain, but does our involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive? 
__label__SPOCK Excuse me, Captain. You asked to be notified when we made visual contact with the Beta Niobe nova. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating, Captain. The knowledge. The depth. 
__label__SPOCK Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians.
__label__SPOCK Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating, Captain. A highly advanced alien entity using this particular system as a laboratory for guiding another race to intelligence. Almost a god, you might say. 
__label__SPOCK Why does he need the crystals? For what reason? 
__label__SPOCK Not precisely, no. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I have managed to loosen this grill somewhat. If the mortar on yours is as old. 
__label__SPOCK I agree. Attack. 
__label__SPOCK Sir? 
__label__SPOCK Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they achieve exactly the same results.
__label__SPOCK It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged, repaired each other, became one. 
__label__SPOCK Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down. 
__label__SPOCK Not directly. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. As I always suspected. (leaves) 
__label__SPOCK Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering? 
__label__SPOCK A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing course toward it. 
__label__SPOCK We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. No answer from the cube.
__label__SPOCK Locked in and ready to beam up consignment. 
__label__SPOCK An illogical question, Doctor, since obviously you are hearing my voice. 
__label__SPOCK I am instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission. 
__label__SPOCK I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing very rapidly. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, even Vulcans? 
__label__SPOCK Annihilation, Jim. Total, complete, absolute annihilation. 
__label__SPOCK (into intercom) Captain Kirk. Spock here.
__label__SPOCK Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills.
__label__SPOCK Yes. Oh. I believe they had a device known as a clutch. Clutch, Captain. Perhaps one of those pedals on the floor. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK In what way? 
__label__SPOCK I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck. 
__label__SPOCK That's enough. 
__label__SPOCK There is a grid. It may be another communications device. But that seems redundant. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found  KIRK: A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That man will go a shore on my orders. What's his name?
__label__SPOCK If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all. 
__label__SPOCK I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner. 
__label__SPOCK Are these attacks frequent? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night. 
__label__SPOCK In that event, I am ordered to kill you and to proceed against the Halkans as the new captain of the Enterprise.
__label__SPOCK The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked. 
__label__SPOCK Can you raise Starfleet? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below. 
__label__SPOCK It has proved effective for Vulcans. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling display of logic. 
__label__SPOCK It would appear someone is curious about us.
__label__SPOCK Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass. 
__label__SPOCK Engineering, maintain full power. Full power. 
__label__SPOCK Position report, please, Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have. 
__label__SPOCK He's maintaining that bearing, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more. 
__label__SPOCK Accidents seldom have such system, Doctor McCoy. I believe we must consider the alternative possibility that the crew of this ship destroyed her themselves. 
__label__SPOCK I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I  KIRK: Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself. 
__label__SPOCK That would seem logical. 
__label__SPOCK We're unable to break completely loose from this force field, but we might be able to punch some holes through it. 
__label__SPOCK Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel. 
__label__SPOCK Nature and description of enemy forces. 
__label__SPOCK Yes.
__label__SPOCK Why, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I request permission to be allowed  KIRK: Denied. 
__label__SPOCK Humans smile with so little provocation. 
__label__SPOCK Good. Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been drawn here with us. Spock to transporter room. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown. 
__label__SPOCK Ready, Captain. [OC] Listen to me. Listen to me. You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. 
__label__SPOCK Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain, particularly in the depth of her jealousy. 
__label__SPOCK No, I can't. Please, don't! 
__label__SPOCK But not totally unexpected. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago. 
__label__SPOCK None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost appears intermittently. 
__label__SPOCK Five thousand years in the future. 
__label__SPOCK Then what am l? 
__label__SPOCK Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors. 
__label__SPOCK The alien vessel will contact Beta Niobe in fifty two point three seconds, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must check it out. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning. 
__label__SPOCK Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us. 
__label__SPOCK In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity. 
__label__SPOCK But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention.
__label__SPOCK His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual. 
__label__SPOCK She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world. 
__label__SPOCK Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control  KIRK: Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved? 
__label__SPOCK It has ceased fire. We're being held in a tractor beam. We're being pulled inside, Commodore. You must veer off. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal. 
__label__SPOCK At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency. 
__label__SPOCK It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends. 
__label__SPOCK I believe you will find ten cc's adequate. 
__label__SPOCK Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in that stable area. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, this symbiont can reproduce itself by mitosis and take over every starship we encounter. It can control computer centres, whole planets. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We shall arrive in your office within ten minutes. Spock out. 
__label__SPOCK I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a landing party may be necessary. 
__label__SPOCK A physiological symptom of latent primal superstition, the fear of primitive people confronting something unknown to them. 
__label__SPOCK Purpose of the invasion? 
__label__SPOCK We don't have much time, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You are not jealous? 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating.
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold. 
__label__SPOCK Examine the H two seven nine elements, also the G nine five systems. 
__label__SPOCK How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure as the one Landru provided. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer. 
__label__SPOCK They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion. 
__label__SPOCK Green. 
__label__SPOCK An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its co-operation, I can do nothing. 
__label__SPOCK Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK A Vendorian, Doctor. Their planet is quarantined, and few people ever do see them. Their ability to rearrange their molecular structure into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of deceit as a way of life puts them off limits. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, attack force almost within phaser range. 
__label__SPOCK And I'm getting normal function in all computer modes. That last pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects. 
__label__SPOCK Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture. 
__label__SPOCK I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the power source is, you should find out where it is not. A simple process of elimination. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK It would seem logical to do so for the moment. 
__label__SPOCK They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with luck, we'll be gone. 
__label__SPOCK None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible. 
__label__SPOCK Easily, Captain. May I ask the purpose? 
__label__SPOCK I think we've found that answer, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Very clever. As to the reason? 
__label__SPOCK Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity. 
__label__SPOCK Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the disputed area, ideally located for use by either side. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted. 
__label__SPOCK The ionised cloud. 
__label__SPOCK It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town. 
__label__SPOCK Is the ship all right? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says. I just heard the sound of  KIRK: The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back. (there are two more guards behind them.)
__label__SPOCK It's possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space, and if that has occurred  MCCOY [OC]: McCoy to Bridge. 
__label__SPOCK You're a wise Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us.
__label__SPOCK Negative, Ensign. Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of it. Compute the distance from the original location. 
__label__SPOCK Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control. 
__label__SPOCK We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit. 
__label__SPOCK A thousand years, Captain?
__label__SPOCK They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain.
__label__SPOCK We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer study.
__label__SPOCK Wrong. His mind killed him. 
__label__SPOCK It just might, Captain. If he was, this would be the second time Lucifer was cast out, and thanks to you, the first time he was saved. 
__label__SPOCK I was recording images at the time McCoy left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the correct time. A week, if we're fortunate. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century.
__label__SPOCK Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us. 
__label__SPOCK I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You now have ten minutes and ten seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Give him the countersign, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Or the purpose of the attack was something else. 
__label__SPOCK Marvellous. 
__label__SPOCK I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx.
__label__SPOCK Captain, library computer confirms that Ensign Walking Bear is correct. The Mayas had a legend of a winged serpent god who came from the skies, bringing knowledge. Such legends were not uncommon among Earth's peoples, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?
__label__SPOCK This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain and friend for many years. And Leonard McCoy, also of long acquaintance. And Uhura, whose name means freedom. 
__label__SPOCK There may be dangers within. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you must get the others away. 
__label__SPOCK Would any known disease organism do that? 
__label__SPOCK I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving. 
__label__SPOCK Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them. 
__label__SPOCK It cannot. It is not logical. 
__label__SPOCK An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue. 
__label__SPOCK And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species. 
__label__SPOCK Instruct female engineer to divert ship's energy into deflector shields. Block probe. 
__label__SPOCK Power beyond critical. Explosion is imminent. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three. 
__label__SPOCK Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports? 
__label__SPOCK Nothing, sir. No motion out there at all. We've lost them, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Last week with you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Check the circuit. 
__label__SPOCK Surak. 
__label__SPOCK That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles.
__label__SPOCK No, thank you. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get through. 
__label__SPOCK I am Kir  KIRK: I am Kirok! I am  SPOCK: Spock! 
__label__SPOCK There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK I believe so, Captain. And I know what you're thinking. It was I who saved myself that other time. 
__label__SPOCK I am quite ready now, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK With my life, T'Pau. 
__label__SPOCK Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search. 
__label__SPOCK It may not have the range it had. In fact, it may not work at all. 
__label__SPOCK I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life  KIRK: There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear?
__label__SPOCK Confirmed, Captain, but it isn't possible. That ship is dead.
__label__SPOCK Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you. 
__label__SPOCK Lock on to Captain Kirk's co-ordinates  [Transporter room]
__label__SPOCK Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.
__label__SPOCK Oh. You mean shot at it. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I see. 
__label__SPOCK Personal log, Commander Spock, USS Enterprise. I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it.
__label__SPOCK Energise. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber. He is being held nearby. 
__label__SPOCK They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you're becoming emotional. 
__label__SPOCK Go, Scott! 
__label__SPOCK I believe I said that, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Power drain is enormous and growing worse. 
__label__SPOCK (picking up two stoned to illustrate his point) Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain. 
__label__SPOCK Or the promise of reward. 
__label__SPOCK Negative! 
__label__SPOCK Activate all units. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? 
__label__SPOCK Jim, Edith Keeler must die. 
__label__SPOCK Must we? 
__label__SPOCK I don't know. But there is a possibility. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. No world in the Federation has produced anything so powerful. Almost beyond theoretical limits. Total conversion of matter to energy at a distance. 
__label__SPOCK Come in. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the universe is safe. 
__label__SPOCK You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you? 
__label__SPOCK Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction. 
__label__SPOCK They are in good working order, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder returned.
__label__SPOCK A miniscule. A very small piece. 
__label__SPOCK Pollux Four. Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere. Sensors indicate no life forms. Approximate age four billion years. Judged no reason for contact. In all respects, quite ordinary, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, what is your situation? 
__label__SPOCK What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity. 
__label__SPOCK They couldn't maintain the stasis field. 
__label__SPOCK Are you a student of history, sir? 
__label__SPOCK I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at something of a loss to understand it, however. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet. 
__label__SPOCK It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination. 
__label__SPOCK Jim. 
__label__SPOCK Ultrasonics. The panel. 
__label__SPOCK No readings yet, Captain. Possibly a second probe. 
__label__SPOCK Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines. 
__label__SPOCK He is not sane. 
__label__SPOCK Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.
__label__SPOCK My father is from the planet Vulcan. 
__label__SPOCK Aren't you going to sit down, sir? 
__label__SPOCK The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. Bridge out. 
__label__SPOCK Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here. 
__label__SPOCK A few moments of love, paid for with several hours of hatred.
__label__SPOCK Captain, doesn't it strike you strange that two such different ecologies could co-exist so closely? 
__label__SPOCK We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation. 
__label__SPOCK If it pleases you. This is animal flesh? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce. 
__label__SPOCK The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life.
__label__SPOCK But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality.
__label__SPOCK Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act. 
__label__SPOCK Activate life support belts. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly. 
__label__SPOCK It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his son. Spock will find his way. 
__label__SPOCK Then bypass the relays and go to manual control. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not life as we know it at all. 
__label__SPOCK Probably both, and if you're asking the logical decision to make KIRK: No, I'm not. The mission of the Enterprise is to seek out and contact alien life.
__label__SPOCK Impossible to say at this moment, Captain. It has made only one action which might be interpreted as intelligent. It changed course from Alondra toward Mantilles. But that could have been an involuntary response to the sensing of food. 
__label__SPOCK No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is an access point. It would also seem to be a  (He steps forward and is flung back.) 
__label__SPOCK Analysing now, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign. 
__label__SPOCK Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course. 
__label__SPOCK Energising. 
__label__SPOCK All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally. 
__label__SPOCK Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations  KIRK: How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate. Invasion.
__label__SPOCK This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body. 
__label__SPOCK All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be fairly heavy displacement. 
__label__SPOCK Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time. 
__label__SPOCK Beam up immediately. 
__label__SPOCK Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable. 
__label__SPOCK Prepare to activate deflectors. 
__label__SPOCK Are your comments a part of the record, sir?
__label__SPOCK Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
__label__SPOCK To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack. 
__label__SPOCK Activated, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion. 
__label__SPOCK It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.
__label__SPOCK Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless  MCCOY: Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality? I, for one, could use a good non-reconstituted meal.
__label__SPOCK Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps an offering of some sort, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Problem, Captain?
__label__SPOCK Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin. 
__label__SPOCK Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts. If you need assistance, I  GAETANO: We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you? 
__label__SPOCK Possible. The only known stasis box detector is another stasis box. Still. Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture? 
__label__SPOCK It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article. 
__label__SPOCK I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk? 
__label__SPOCK Totally illogical. There was no chance. 
__label__SPOCK That is illogical, Ensign. Odours cannot travel through the vacuum of space. 
__label__SPOCK Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays. 
__label__SPOCK A place? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, request permission to KIRK: Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here.
__label__SPOCK I quite understand, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them. She's made no attempt to contact our minds. 
__label__SPOCK I was beginning to wonder. 
__label__SPOCK Countermand alarm. All engines full stop.
__label__SPOCK They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect us to act rashly. 
__label__SPOCK Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four? 
__label__SPOCK One point one kilometres, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, I do have duties to perform. 
__label__SPOCK They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Evasive action, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes. 
__label__SPOCK Negative in the deck area, Captain. He may have gotten out.
__label__SPOCK You cannot succeed, Commodore. Your only logical alternative is to return to the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Standing by. 
__label__SPOCK So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect. 
__label__SPOCK I do not desire the captaincy. I much prefer my scientific duties. I am frankly content to be a lesser target. 
__label__SPOCK In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos. 
__label__SPOCK We're locked onto the Exeter's engineering section, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard.
__label__SPOCK Five in all. 
__label__SPOCK No signs of sapient life forms. 
__label__SPOCK And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours? 
__label__SPOCK I know them now. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly fifty nine point two two three days, Doctor, and that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you? 
__label__SPOCK That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply. 
__label__SPOCK Your logic is excellent, Captain. There is a random factor to the ship disappearances. Perhaps the touching of the two time continuums is erratic. In any event, the window stayed open long enough for us to follow the Klothos in. 
__label__SPOCK We are not Archons, Marplon. 
__label__SPOCK Plague, Dramia Two. Of unknown origin, characterised by pigmentation changes in skin of victim, debilitation, death. Certain species known to have natural immunity, notably Vulcan. Hmm.
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago. 
__label__SPOCK You think you know what it was, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer.
__label__SPOCK Vulcan, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. You must rely on your human intuition. 
__label__SPOCK Allow me to test the water first, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK We've got to have those communicators, Jim. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened.
__label__SPOCK He did not pay royalties. 
__label__SPOCK And you, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK We can negate sections of it, creating openings through which we can fire our phaser banks. 
__label__SPOCK She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned. 
__label__SPOCK There's a relay junction down the corridor. 
__label__SPOCK This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids. 
__label__SPOCK Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've never encountered readings like this before. 
__label__SPOCK Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none. 
__label__SPOCK It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it. 
__label__SPOCK The beam is originating at least one thousand light years away. 
__label__SPOCK What was there to do? 
__label__SPOCK Fate, Captain. Fate. 
__label__SPOCK Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard. 
__label__SPOCK Right. 
__label__SPOCK Captain.
__label__SPOCK I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't games  KIRK: Spock. Spock. (sits) Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different. The name of the game is called fizzbin. 
__label__SPOCK I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose. 
__label__SPOCK Our experience here has shown us the means of diverting quakes.
__label__SPOCK The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. 
__label__SPOCK We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. 
__label__SPOCK Checkmate. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
__label__SPOCK Plant life, Captain. Primitive and aggressive. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped. 
__label__SPOCK There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?
__label__SPOCK Yes. 
__label__SPOCK I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's. 
__label__SPOCK Exceptionally strong contact. Not visual yet. Distant spectrograph. Metallic, similar to cube. Much greater energy reading.
__label__SPOCK I expect only to reveal the truth. 
__label__SPOCK An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things. 
__label__SPOCK Carter Winston's? 
__label__SPOCK I do not know, but it is possible. 
__label__SPOCK That may be true, but they rarely enter Federation space and fire on Federation vessels without reason. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Television was the colloquial term. 
__label__SPOCK Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods. 
__label__SPOCK The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880. 
__label__SPOCK To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK You did that to me deliberately. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It appears to be a native food-gathering party. 
__label__SPOCK On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume  GARTH: Remove this animal! 
__label__SPOCK Chekov, take over on scanner. 
__label__SPOCK Our sensors are in a state of chaos, Captain. They became unreliable when we entered the Triangle. 
__label__SPOCK I am.
__label__SPOCK Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat. 
__label__SPOCK Jim.
__label__SPOCK Need any help, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK M-5 has performed admirably so far. 
__label__SPOCK We must. The vaccine could be fatal. 
__label__SPOCK We're travelling at a safe distance from the nova, Mrs. April. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, please answer the question. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, are you all right? 
__label__SPOCK And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Picking up two life-forms in the gallery. 
__label__SPOCK Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command. Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory. 
__label__SPOCK Class M planet, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor, you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed long enough, he dies. 
__label__SPOCK Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard. 
__label__SPOCK Correct, Captain. And a rain forest this close to a desert is also illogical. It is my theory that what we have seen since we landed was manufactured, not created. 
__label__SPOCK I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me. 
__label__SPOCK The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously. 
__label__SPOCK There's something disquieting about these creatures. 
__label__SPOCK Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Lucien. Next witness, please. Captain James T Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK I have them, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen, search in progress.
__label__SPOCK (taking his weapon) I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, acknowledge. Unable to flood Engineering section.
__label__SPOCK Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a surprise attack as a problem for the M-5. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK No response. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya regains consciousness. 
__label__SPOCK The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence. 
__label__SPOCK None as yet, sir. But sensors now indicate it is twice our size.
__label__SPOCK We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain.
__label__SPOCK No, they cannot. Or rather, will not. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Energise, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered. 
__label__SPOCK The weightless state has become their natural condition. 
__label__SPOCK After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost the picture the Metron was sending us.
__label__SPOCK It could happen anytime. 
__label__SPOCK On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know? 
__label__SPOCK All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course and on schedule. 
__label__SPOCK We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four hundred degrees. Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees.
__label__SPOCK Yes. In my opinion. 
__label__SPOCK We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of their communication devices. 
__label__SPOCK We go together. 
__label__SPOCK Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours. 
__label__SPOCK If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our  KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. What's happening up there? 
__label__SPOCK On what grounds, Commodore? 
__label__SPOCK I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative.
__label__SPOCK Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at. 
__label__SPOCK Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions. 
__label__SPOCK I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex. 
__label__SPOCK Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently they've all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past. 
__label__SPOCK Yes Captain, but you may find it difficult to believe. The vessel is registered to Carter Winston. 
__label__SPOCK And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Stokaline. 
__label__SPOCK Pain! Pain! Pain! (he staggers back) That's all I got, Captain.
__label__SPOCK No, Captain. I can travel. 
__label__SPOCK I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly. 
__label__SPOCK Please, Mister Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic. I have said nothing. I was merely speculating. 
__label__SPOCK Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. Crater! (Kirk fires his phaser) 
__label__SPOCK All right. 
__label__SPOCK All banks maintain firing rate. 
__label__SPOCK Damage report, all stations. 
__label__SPOCK This is Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder. 
__label__SPOCK Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed. 
__label__SPOCK With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy. 
__label__SPOCK One might have said so in the first place. 
__label__SPOCK It has simply disappeared, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated. 
__label__SPOCK Diverting all secondary power to the shields. (McCoy enters) I'll continue communications as long as there is power to transmit. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. Ninety seven point eight three five megatons. 
__label__SPOCK Contact in thirty nine seconds. Thirty eight, thirty seven  SPOCK: Thirteen, twelve, eleven  KIRK: Get ready to execute course change, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children.
__label__SPOCK How very flattering. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered. 
__label__SPOCK Band honours ready, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK First officer of the Enterprise. (Broken-hearted, she slaps his face.) What is your present form of execution?
__label__SPOCK That's very well taken, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The deflectors will not stop it, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard radiation. 
__label__SPOCK I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship. 
__label__SPOCK How much time do we have? 
__label__SPOCK Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky. 
__label__SPOCK Vessel changing course, heading toward us at high warp speed. 
__label__SPOCK Must I make an example of you, too, Helm? 
__label__SPOCK It would appear a more logical solution is in order, Captain. We don't lift the tail off, we dig the Doctor out. 
__label__SPOCK Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations.
__label__SPOCK I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. 
__label__SPOCK I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.
__label__SPOCK No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending.
__label__SPOCK The danger from the Romulans  STOCKER: Mister Spock, we have to save these people. Mister Sulu, set a direct course for Starbase Ten. Warp five. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault. 
__label__SPOCK Bridge. Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach. 
__label__SPOCK There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes. 
__label__SPOCK That is very kind of you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK This was three hundred years ago, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral? 
__label__SPOCK A self-destruct mechanism would not have a gun sight. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station. 
__label__SPOCK True, Your Excellency. 
__label__SPOCK You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture. 
__label__SPOCK It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back. 
__label__SPOCK You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you. 
__label__SPOCK She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of self-healing. 
__label__SPOCK The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren wasteland. I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a place. 
__label__SPOCK Did he order you to increase orbit? 
__label__SPOCK As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. 
__label__SPOCK (pushes a load of buttons) Enterprise, this is Spock. Force field has been eliminated. (turns main power back on again)
__label__SPOCK Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly. 
__label__SPOCK Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An amazing parallel. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that direction. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK I suffer the same affliction as you, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain. Under at least one hundred miles of solid rock. 
__label__SPOCK Will that be all, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe.
__label__SPOCK I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. 
__label__SPOCK But only two. More Organians will die. 
__label__SPOCK It is an energy-sapping field of great strength, Captain. It immobilizes a starship and its weapons capability. But apparently, it also immobilizes the attacking ship's abilities at the same time. 
__label__SPOCK I am sorry.
__label__SPOCK Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this planet, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Right away, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space.
__label__SPOCK You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated. 
__label__SPOCK Tractor beam again.
__label__SPOCK I suspected you would go. You are worried about the kahs-wan ordeal. 
__label__SPOCK Cat and mouse game. 
__label__SPOCK You were born? 
__label__SPOCK What is puzzling you, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The ship's computers will handle the helm on this voyage, Mister Hansen. Course will be computed and set automatically. 
__label__SPOCK But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in the event we've overlooked any minor damage. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. 
__label__SPOCK Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends.
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals.
__label__SPOCK Exactly like the Engineering controls and the life-support systems on decks five and six. 
__label__SPOCK (hoarse) Yes. Doctor McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Report to the bridge immediately. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Of course. 
__label__SPOCK Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. 
__label__SPOCK If you will excuse me, Captain. (leaves) 
__label__SPOCK Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. 
__label__SPOCK Approaching second beaming, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you. 
__label__SPOCK Forget.  
__label__SPOCK Their speed is better than warp six, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life forms in a given area. 
__label__SPOCK Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK I can estimate some of this, Captain, but without more time  SEVEN: Captain, he can only guess. Will you please let me do my job. 
__label__SPOCK Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us. 
__label__SPOCK Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct. 
__label__SPOCK The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life. 
__label__SPOCK Damage in communications, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Very possible. 
__label__SPOCK Something's preventing my phaser from operating.
__label__SPOCK Later, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Seconds now, sir. Stand by. 
__label__SPOCK A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct. 
__label__SPOCK If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK I am not Herbert. 
__label__SPOCK I can't infect the planet, Captain. And I can get McCoy. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. 
__label__SPOCK Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but the bodies as well. 
__label__SPOCK Motion sensor signal stopped. 
__label__SPOCK He is not the captain. 
__label__SPOCK The weight of three grown men. 
__label__SPOCK Reverse polarity on your magnetic probe. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems. 
__label__SPOCK Several times, Captain. I do not wish to surrender hope, but the facts remain unchangeable. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us. 
__label__SPOCK At what age did you become a starship captain? And when did you enter Starfleet Academy? 
__label__SPOCK That is not correct. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot obey your order, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there KIRK: and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing. And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here. 
__label__SPOCK They're running away. Very odd. They did not use their stasis weapon at all. 
__label__SPOCK Engine room! 
__label__SPOCK What is this? 
__label__SPOCK Can you estimate minimum time required for repair? 
__label__SPOCK Then the sooner you begin, the better. 
__label__SPOCK You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go. 
__label__SPOCK No, Lieutenant, the cloud has engulfed Alondra. Captain, the planet seems to be breaking up. Its mass is definitely growing smaller.
__label__SPOCK Is Zeon a threat to them? 
__label__SPOCK Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal. 
__label__SPOCK You wished to see me, sir? 
__label__SPOCK Down! I must take it down. 
__label__SPOCK Such restraint would be welcome. 
__label__SPOCK An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It measures completely Earth-like. 
__label__SPOCK During the Enterprise's last visit here, Doctor McCoy was mortally wounded. Correct? 
__label__SPOCK The kahs-wan, a survival test traditional for young males. 
__label__SPOCK It would appear that the Enterprise is the target, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of the creature. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl. This is the only lead we've had. 
__label__SPOCK Full warp power on my order. Now. 
__label__SPOCK No, Captain. The historical records of this solar system are spotty, at best, going back nineteen years. Mostly they're technical data, meteor showers, auroras, radiation reports. 
__label__SPOCK If we find an answer, it will still take time. 
__label__SPOCK When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this? 
__label__SPOCK The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings. 
__label__SPOCK Understood, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that not crucial to your decision? 
__label__SPOCK A reasonable course. 
__label__SPOCK I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health. 
__label__SPOCK There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there. 
__label__SPOCK The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon. 
__label__SPOCK Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises. 
__label__SPOCK Kill it, Captain, quickly. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we've been attacked. The transporter is damaged. We're taking evasive action. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien intelligence and reason with it. 
__label__SPOCK Trouble, Mister Chekov? 
__label__SPOCK No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead. 
__label__SPOCK I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I never laugh. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, its registering energy. Very little, but building. 
__label__SPOCK I shall attempt it. 
__label__SPOCK We are ready, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed. 
__label__SPOCK Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you would be more precise. 
__label__SPOCK There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK I'll activate the force field myself. You can return to your section. 
__label__SPOCK Curious, very curious. 
__label__SPOCK What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign? 
__label__SPOCK Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have  KIRK: She really liked those ears? 
__label__SPOCK Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back means. 
__label__SPOCK But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. 
__label__SPOCK You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it communicate with you? 
__label__SPOCK This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years. This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee,  MCCOY: He called it Koon-ut what? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I've just had a most fascinating meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important inconsistency. 
__label__SPOCK It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. The Vedala would have informed us if there were any live beings here we should know of. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. A neural field? 
__label__SPOCK It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer. 
__label__SPOCK I wish to ask a question. What of Sarek's family, his wife and son? 
__label__SPOCK Check out the life-support systems. 
__label__SPOCK Not legends, Doctor. Fact. Vulcan was visited by alien beings.
__label__SPOCK Affirmative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Is he dead, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK It seems to be of irregular shape, some eight hundred thousand kilometres across and about half that in depth. 
__label__SPOCK Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain. 
__label__SPOCK One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support systems functioning. Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen.
__label__SPOCK Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates. 
__label__SPOCK May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?
__label__SPOCK Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and now number three's gone silent. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK They may have nothing to report. Our sensors indicate no life forms except our landing party. 
__label__SPOCK I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be registered on sensors. 
__label__SPOCK What now, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is, Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors indicate the smaller vessel is a one-man scout ship of common design. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here.
__label__SPOCK I must see the captain. 
__label__SPOCK But they are not allowed to share its advantages. 
__label__SPOCK It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is under control. 
__label__SPOCK With whom are you at war? 
__label__SPOCK I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human. 
__label__SPOCK Christine.
__label__SPOCK Explain computer activity in the engineering section. 
__label__SPOCK Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK There is a certain scientific logic about it. 
__label__SPOCK Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition. 
__label__SPOCK Try to break through it, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK Factor of thirty two point nine. 
__label__SPOCK I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed.
__label__SPOCK By drinking the Scalosian water. (and does so) 
__label__SPOCK Please believe me. I do appreciate it. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain. 
__label__SPOCK Transporter Room, stand by to beam landing party aboard. 
__label__SPOCK Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not? 
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency, grant this one request. 
__label__SPOCK The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field. 
__label__SPOCK At that rate, it will take exactly seventy four point one solar hours for the storm to pass. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for us to attempt a rescue. 
__label__SPOCK Spock again, Captain. Those medical supplies are badly needed on planet Theta Seven. They are expecting us to get them there on time. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK None. 
__label__SPOCK It appears to be  MCCOY: I don't want to think about it. 
__label__SPOCK For what, sir? 
__label__SPOCK If we stay. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it. 
__label__SPOCK If it follows its present path, it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura, you are supposed to be monitoring the alien vessel. Our first priority is to free the Enterprise and ourselves.
__label__SPOCK It seems, Captain, I am the only one affected. The mission, the ship, the crew, except for myself, remain the same. 
__label__SPOCK That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.
__label__SPOCK Could be coming from beneath the planet's surface. Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity. 
__label__SPOCK The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for one do not believe in angels. 
__label__SPOCK Yes.
__label__SPOCK Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres. 
__label__SPOCK Block them out. 
__label__SPOCK In six seconds. 
__label__SPOCK There is no life on this planet. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. I am undamaged, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four? 
__label__SPOCK Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements.
__label__SPOCK May we see you a moment? 
__label__SPOCK Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly a result of the severe storm. Captain, do you feel any abnormal effects? 
__label__SPOCK Do you want a galactic war on your conscience? 
__label__SPOCK Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. 
__label__SPOCK The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let him attempt it. 
__label__SPOCK More power to the shields. 
__label__SPOCK You'll have to delay. 
__label__SPOCK Warp factor one, Captain.  
__label__SPOCK Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction. 
__label__SPOCK The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK You are a stowaway, Commander. 
__label__SPOCK The seabed should stabilize within a few hours. 
__label__SPOCK An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon Van Gelder.
__label__SPOCK I don't believe I want to tell you. 
__label__SPOCK Joy be with you. Peace and contentment. 
__label__SPOCK The touch of death. 
__label__SPOCK You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you. 
__label__SPOCK Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself. 
__label__SPOCK The captain wanted us to wait here. 
__label__SPOCK The field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles. If the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out. 
__label__SPOCK They would also seem to be our only hope. 
__label__SPOCK As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, shall I beam down an armed party? 
__label__SPOCK I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it. 
__label__SPOCK Many of us live on the things you consume. 
__label__SPOCK Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors not recording normal energy output. 
__label__SPOCK This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan. 
__label__SPOCK Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw on other sources.
__label__SPOCK Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door. 
__label__SPOCK Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take the risk. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds. 
__label__SPOCK Crewman, stand aside.
__label__SPOCK The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry would be quite efficacious. 
__label__SPOCK Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?
__label__SPOCK And they were correct. I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its technical translation is cave dweller. 
__label__SPOCK He'll do it. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy, I  MCCOY: I've waited a long time for this, and you're not going to cheat me. 
__label__SPOCK This will not take long. 
__label__SPOCK Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously. Military secrets are the most fleeting of all. I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent. 
__label__SPOCK I am moving slowly now, establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus. 
__label__SPOCK Why do the Nazis hate Zeons? 
__label__SPOCK I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding. 
__label__SPOCK This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman. (he tests its hand movement.) It is ready, Thalassa. 
__label__SPOCK Request rescue party. All-female. Repeat. All-female. All  (He collapses) 
__label__SPOCK He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them.
__label__SPOCK It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red Alert. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim! 
__label__SPOCK First group from the Klingon vessel, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Life support systems sustaining on emergency. 
__label__SPOCK I do not approve. I understand. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The Vians too must be capable of saving his life. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. Mechanical manifestations, of course. Was anyone considering the subject of pterodactyls? 
__label__SPOCK I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Yes.
__label__SPOCK And it explains the murdered men. 
__label__SPOCK Most remarkable. 
__label__SPOCK And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown. 
__label__SPOCK I believe it is not a natural object, but a ship. 
__label__SPOCK The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like. 
__label__SPOCK Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship. You want the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more. 
__label__SPOCK I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted. 
__label__SPOCK Deflection point. 
__label__SPOCK Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines. 
__label__SPOCK We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and millions will die who did not die before. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice. 
__label__SPOCK It refers to the altar. Apply pressure to the centre until it opens. 
__label__SPOCK Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise.
__label__SPOCK However, not exactly safe. 
__label__SPOCK It will not be long now, old friend. 
__label__SPOCK I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself. 
__label__SPOCK I am inside you. 
__label__SPOCK We have no more questions, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown at present, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Approaching the life-form, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science. 
__label__SPOCK Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is, we could extinguish ourselves. 
__label__SPOCK (channeling the Horta) It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure.
__label__SPOCK Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure. 
__label__SPOCK By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape. 
__label__SPOCK I love you. I can love you. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative. (Kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision) All instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the barrier.  SCOTT: Outside hull temperatures rising, sir. It's over two thousand degrees now. Sir? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is answering the helm. 
__label__SPOCK A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms aboard. 
__label__SPOCK And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago. 
__label__SPOCK Anything? 
__label__SPOCK I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron. 
__label__SPOCK Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder. 
__label__SPOCK I want full power, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our request with a reply? 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos. 
__label__SPOCK Complete analysis. 
__label__SPOCK That has been his reputation. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. I want to protect her, hold her in my arms. 
__label__SPOCK This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of course.
__label__SPOCK Yes, Your Excellency. 
__label__SPOCK Readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis.
__label__SPOCK It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception  KIRK: Right down your alley, Spock. Get it here and get to work. That thing is still out there. Better go that way. 
__label__SPOCK That's my affair. 
__label__SPOCK Hallucinations? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Spock here.
__label__SPOCK Only the beginning of a theory, Captain. It is possible this cloud in which we are entrapped is a living thing. The cloud is alive.
__label__SPOCK It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists. 
__label__SPOCK My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And now I'll go to my quarters. 
__label__SPOCK Quite correct, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Why, thank you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine. Were you born a telepath? 
__label__SPOCK Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside. 
__label__SPOCK One hundred thousand kilometres. They should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me.
__label__SPOCK Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power. 
__label__SPOCK I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain. 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Is this a dead man, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK The child? 
__label__SPOCK If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem. 
__label__SPOCK Fire phasers. 
__label__SPOCK I'm not aware of it, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the Captain. And he'll be the next target. 
__label__SPOCK I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs.
__label__SPOCK Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well. 
__label__SPOCK Attacking vessels are moving off. 
__label__SPOCK The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger. 
__label__SPOCK Temperature one hundred fifteen degrees. 
__label__SPOCK The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet. 
__label__SPOCK Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate where that voice is coming from. (McCoy and Scott enter) 
__label__SPOCK We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years. 
__label__SPOCK Captain! Jim! 
__label__SPOCK Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho. 
__label__SPOCK If I could help him, I would. I cannot.
__label__SPOCK That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will find it. 
__label__SPOCK Activate port impulse engines. One third power. 
__label__SPOCK Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer. 
__label__SPOCK No one can guarantee the actions of another. 
__label__SPOCK Emotional, isn't she? 
__label__SPOCK There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore, I've heard. 
__label__SPOCK Firing, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Please elaborate, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK To beam down to your council chamber. 
__label__SPOCK Do we have final clearance from Gideon? 
__label__SPOCK I still prefer my physiological structure to yours. 
__label__SPOCK Transporter room standing by, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. 
__label__SPOCK I believe that is what I just said, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser two. 
__label__SPOCK I'll be back shortly, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Their attempt has given me an idea as to how we may be able to break through the time barrier. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance. 
__label__SPOCK For the moment. 
__label__SPOCK Feels, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut? 
__label__SPOCK Undoubtedly. 
__label__SPOCK Is something wrong, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Melkotian object. 
__label__SPOCK If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link. 
__label__SPOCK Three minutes forty two point seven seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception capability. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you. We will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard. 
__label__SPOCK Direct hit, Captain. Damage to the secondary propulsion system.
__label__SPOCK Captain, several people approaching. 
__label__SPOCK Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Then you live here alone. 
__label__SPOCK With a delayed action fuse. 
__label__SPOCK It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them. 
__label__SPOCK A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it. 
__label__SPOCK Approximately 1691, Captain. Salem Massachusetts, if I recall your historical records correctly. 
__label__SPOCK Something odd, Captain. You said two people. 
__label__SPOCK Our boosters. 
__label__SPOCK It appears we're all victims of a rather bizarre coincidence.
__label__SPOCK They are inseparably close to one another. We cannot transport one  [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK Ready, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled. 
__label__SPOCK Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present situation. 
__label__SPOCK On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead. 
__label__SPOCK Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five, eight six. She'll blow soon!
__label__SPOCK M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter-antimatter reserves. 
__label__SPOCK I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.
__label__SPOCK Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance? 
__label__SPOCK In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott.
__label__SPOCK How long will he be asleep, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Useless. They're on override in Engineering. 
__label__SPOCK (to Kara, amid laughter) As I was saying, a fascinating cultural development of the kind which hasn't been seen in ages. The last such occurrence took place on old Earth, when the Romans were warring with the ....  
__label__SPOCK Reset. Energise. 
__label__SPOCK Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
__label__SPOCK None. 
__label__SPOCK All decks have reported green, Mister Bailey.
__label__SPOCK We'll be welcome back, in twenty or thirty centuries. 
__label__SPOCK It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear. 
__label__SPOCK Irritation? 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders. 
__label__SPOCK All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your first citizen? 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is accepted. Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK They seem to be gorged. 
__label__SPOCK Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded? 
__label__SPOCK No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses. Most curious. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz. (breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage. An analysis should prove interesting. 
__label__SPOCK That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command. If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain, an excellent idea. 
__label__SPOCK Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion. 
__label__SPOCK And if they're real, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history.
__label__SPOCK I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth. 
__label__SPOCK Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
__label__SPOCK Not a vessel, a ground source. The third planet in this solar system, according to my instruments. 
__label__SPOCK Any chance these could be hallucinations? 
__label__SPOCK Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on? 
__label__SPOCK I see. The Megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and learned wisdom since they last saw Earth. Your compassion was that proof, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty. 
__label__SPOCK Twelve hours, Captain? That is unprecedented. 
__label__SPOCK You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately. 
__label__SPOCK You'll show no further hostility? 
__label__SPOCK I tend to agree.
__label__SPOCK It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to communicate. 
__label__SPOCK Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them. 
__label__SPOCK From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a remarkable culture this is. 
__label__SPOCK Co-ordination is completed. 
__label__SPOCK I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were. 
__label__SPOCK All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. 
__label__SPOCK I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all. 
__label__SPOCK Do these waves cease while you are asleep? 
__label__SPOCK The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher to go to Saturn. 
__label__SPOCK The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you're too close. 
__label__SPOCK A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much. 
__label__SPOCK Very well. (just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie.
__label__SPOCK I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles. 
__label__SPOCK With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research and join you on the bridge. 
__label__SPOCK Starfleet Command may think otherwise. 
__label__SPOCK Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance. (communicator beeps) Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free. 
__label__SPOCK Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were KIRK: Irrational, or drugged.
__label__SPOCK Your correct name. 
__label__SPOCK I tell you I'm well able to defeat you. 
__label__SPOCK You made contact? 
__label__SPOCK I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the ship. 
__label__SPOCK Five seconds. Four, three  UHURA: All stations report Yellow Alert status, sir. Captain, I'm getting some sort of subspace radio signal. 
__label__SPOCK Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures, but not human.
__label__SPOCK That is, of course, your affair. Captain, may I inquire if you intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the Halkans? 
__label__SPOCK She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity. Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently our friends learned very quickly. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has only been aboard seventy two hours. 
__label__SPOCK Assume you are a Slaver war computer. You've been turned off.
__label__SPOCK Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace yourselves. The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive. Contact [Bridge]
__label__SPOCK I'll finish with the furnace. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Totally unfamiliar. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction. 
__label__SPOCK Everybody, concentrate on Captain Kirk. Form a thought screen. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies. 
__label__SPOCK But not as safe. 
__label__SPOCK Nurse, programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents. (there's a buzz) Doctor, did you just  MCCOY: I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos. 
__label__SPOCK I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it. 
__label__SPOCK Based on present data, I would say yes. 
__label__SPOCK Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism. 
__label__SPOCK The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can risk a limited exposure. 
__label__SPOCK Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore  MCCOY: Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living. Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out. That's it, isn't it?
__label__SPOCK Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well.
__label__SPOCK Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like animals. Only children. 
__label__SPOCK Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years. 
__label__SPOCK That is my concern. 
__label__SPOCK A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo. 
__label__SPOCK There was nothing to spare. I shall continue my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it. 
__label__SPOCK We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis. 
__label__SPOCK It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus. 
__label__SPOCK We have been encased in a globular force field, Captain. The source is the approaching vessel. 
__label__SPOCK Logical. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. Very good, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, something is beaming aboard this vessel. 
__label__SPOCK I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.
__label__SPOCK Yes. 
__label__SPOCK A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to a better way. With these bodies. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK But he wanted to, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK We came here in peace, Tribune. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would you pull those records, please? 
__label__SPOCK Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the planet. 
__label__SPOCK The probability of his presence on Motherlode is eight one percent plus or minus point five three. 
__label__SPOCK The readings would so indicate. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard. 
__label__SPOCK If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger.
__label__SPOCK I am Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Kyle. 
__label__SPOCK However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure. 
__label__SPOCK Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently. 
__label__SPOCK Not now. 
__label__SPOCK The day is still young, Ensign. 
__label__SPOCK One degree to overlap. Stand by to photograph. Now.
__label__SPOCK In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah, Miranda. There you are.
__label__SPOCK Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark fourteen. 
__label__SPOCK They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted this. 
__label__SPOCK The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its mission. The USS Valiant. Listed as missing in space. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins. 
__label__SPOCK This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour.
__label__SPOCK Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me.
__label__SPOCK By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven. 
__label__SPOCK I don't think so, sir. 
__label__SPOCK I understand. 
__label__SPOCK Sensor scans give a rough approximation of the age of the metal in the hulls, Captain. Some of them have been here for centuries. 
__label__SPOCK I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances being introduced. 
__label__SPOCK I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris. 
__label__SPOCK I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity. 
__label__SPOCK Very well indeed, thank you, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Unknown, Captain. However, Mister Sulu has computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as a base course.
__label__SPOCK You're welcome. 
__label__SPOCK Very well, sir. 
__label__SPOCK I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The polarized elements would burn out quickly. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcans never bluff. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise. Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged.  STONE: So Finney is alive. 
__label__SPOCK Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of the Body. 
__label__SPOCK We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura.
__label__SPOCK Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. USS Enterprise to signaler on planet surface. Identify self. 
__label__SPOCK The Captain states the case emotionally, of course, but correctly. I would be of little value to this ship if I am confined to a tank in Sickbay. I must accompany the Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge. 
__label__SPOCK What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova. 
__label__SPOCK The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then. 
__label__SPOCK It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers. 
__label__SPOCK Acute observation, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars. 
__label__SPOCK Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. Which would seem to be impossible. 
__label__SPOCK Get us off, Scott! 
__label__SPOCK Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Another conventional weapon. It appears the total conversion beam was the only thing the Slavers had that we do not. 
__label__SPOCK Really. 
__label__SPOCK We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister Scott can maintain power. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, please don't  KIRK: You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl. 
__label__SPOCK Getting another life reading, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Please commence. I'll explain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, those villi are antimatter. It the Enterprise touches one of them  KIRK: We'll explode. Mister Sulu, keep the deflectors up at all costs. 
__label__SPOCK I have security clearance, Chief.
__label__SPOCK The one receiving a medal. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch. 
__label__SPOCK Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very light. 
__label__SPOCK I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK What brings you here? 
__label__SPOCK Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two. 
__label__SPOCK Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit.
__label__SPOCK Doctor, you are a sensualist.
__label__SPOCK No, sir. They hadn't reached it. 
__label__SPOCK An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold. 
__label__SPOCK Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him. 
__label__SPOCK Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? 
__label__SPOCK Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First Officer Spock in command. The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours. Computer probability projections are useless due to insufficient data.
__label__SPOCK Come in. 
__label__SPOCK Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu? 
__label__SPOCK Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam? 
__label__SPOCK My mother. The son, what was his name and age when he died? 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Sulu, evaluation. 
__label__SPOCK Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those orders? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, it was not a storm. 
__label__SPOCK You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I believe I just said that, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Mother  AMANDA: Oh, go to him. Now. Please. 
__label__SPOCK Engineer Scott as well. Unfortunately, I do not know where I am. 
__label__SPOCK Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts. 
__label__SPOCK The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any other course of action. The Tholian ship had to be disabled. 
__label__SPOCK How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you have. This thing you call language though, most remarkable. You depend on it for so very much. But is any one of you really its master? But most of all, the aloneness.
__label__SPOCK Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out. 
__label__SPOCK No, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us? 
__label__SPOCK Unquestionably. Most impressive. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. 
__label__SPOCK (attempting a mind meld) He simply appears to have turned himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship  KIRK: It seems we're going to take a little trip.
__label__SPOCK I'm afraid not. 
__label__SPOCK For once I agree with you, Doctor. The more informative specimens will come from the sea bottom. 
__label__SPOCK Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien. 
__label__SPOCK Ready. 
__label__SPOCK Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.
__label__SPOCK On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK All fighting must end, Captain, to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone. 
__label__SPOCK Biology. 
__label__SPOCK We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor, your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK Exercise rating, Captain. Ninety four percent.
__label__SPOCK Is that Nancy, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK There should be no life on this planet. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel, it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets. 
__label__SPOCK Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Mister Atoz. 
__label__SPOCK Can we predict the same for you, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very scientific. 
__label__SPOCK Instruments returning to normal, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK It is impossible to calculate, Captain. There are too many unknown factors. I can only try to accomplish the link. No more. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. 
__label__SPOCK Since we must have our captain back, I accept. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK Not at all, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps there is a way open on the far side. There is much less activity there. 
__label__SPOCK Not that I have observed, Captain. Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied. 
__label__SPOCK Regrettable that this society has chosen suicide. Mister Kyle, you were instructed to compensate during the ion storm. 
__label__SPOCK Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved. 
__label__SPOCK You underestimate yourself, Commander. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, these beings are of botanical origin. 
__label__SPOCK You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test. 
__label__SPOCK The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I can understand. 
__label__SPOCK I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those symbols are the key. 
__label__SPOCK The force field is gone, Captain. M-5 is neutralised. 
__label__SPOCK Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam from it.
__label__SPOCK And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it. 
__label__SPOCK Through the centre of things, Doctor. Through what may be the centre of everything. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, does everyone here carry firearms? 
__label__SPOCK I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you continue draining the phasers. 
__label__SPOCK I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago. 
__label__SPOCK The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical shock. 
__label__SPOCK A small one. 
__label__SPOCK It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer, Doctor. The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining. 
__label__SPOCK Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed is still increasing. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Chekov. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with Ambassador Kollos. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable behaviour,  KIRK: Is my concern, not yours. You would find me a formidable enemy. 
__label__SPOCK This single object is the source of all the time displacement. 
__label__SPOCK M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder. 
__label__SPOCK The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in architecture. Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe. 
__label__SPOCK I almost envy you your assignment. 
__label__SPOCK These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a most satisfactory display. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we've reached the designated position for scanning the coded directive tape. 
__label__SPOCK Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command. 
__label__SPOCK Captain Kirk, I presume. 
__label__SPOCK Do you agree with it, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Sabotage. 
__label__SPOCK One of us could go back to contact Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK We do not know that Lokai has done that. 
__label__SPOCK I see no alternative. 
__label__SPOCK When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is actually Doctor McCoy's child. 
__label__SPOCK I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been discovered. 
__label__SPOCK There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove.
__label__SPOCK We came rather close to making it more than honorary. 
__label__SPOCK Spock. 
__label__SPOCK It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done.
__label__SPOCK Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I may be able to get a translation. 
__label__SPOCK We have reached projected point three, Captain. Adjust to new course two oh one mark one five. 
__label__SPOCK Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention. 
__label__SPOCK Our phasers don't work either. 
__label__SPOCK Not a projection, sir. A field of energy. 
__label__SPOCK He's passed us. All shields held. 
__label__SPOCK Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like space legends.
__label__SPOCK I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings. 
__label__SPOCK Negative to both, Captain. Unknown alloy, harder and lighter than any registered metal. It is not a recorded galactic starship design. Retro analysis of the ship's spectra dates it as having been in orbit here for slightly more than three hundred million years. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. 
__label__SPOCK Transporter room to Captain. 
__label__SPOCK That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical. 
__label__SPOCK Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle. 
__label__SPOCK I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good doctor's hypo. 
__label__SPOCK Something quite extraordinary. 
__label__SPOCK I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power. 
__label__SPOCK The Vedala would not have chosen Lara if her abilities were less than perfect. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I know what I know. 
__label__SPOCK Am I in error, Mister Boma? 
__label__SPOCK Flypaper.
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which is most compatible. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into quadrant nine oh four. Beta Six is eight days distant. 
__label__SPOCK There is still one problem, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Phasers do not respond, Captain. We must have sustained damage to the power pack when the creature struck us. 
__label__SPOCK The lean, be-draggles one is a reader of minds. 
__label__SPOCK Radiation from the short end of the spectrum increasing.
__label__SPOCK May I? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, you might lose the doctor that way. 
__label__SPOCK Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am substantial. You are not imagining this. 
__label__SPOCK Good, Captain. Try to reason with them. Keep trying, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Interesting. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop. 
__label__SPOCK I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures. Don't you think? 
__label__SPOCK What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting. 
__label__SPOCK We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all. 
__label__SPOCK May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been rendered academic. The creature is now after us. 
__label__SPOCK No one out there to see it. 
__label__SPOCK No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately. 
__label__SPOCK May I suggest, Captain, that we might find some of the answers we're after without leaving the safety of this cave. 
__label__SPOCK Can you be ready? 
__label__SPOCK Please continue. 
__label__SPOCK I believe we have a match, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two years ago. 
__label__SPOCK Radiation nearing the tolerance level.
__label__SPOCK Strange. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done. 
__label__SPOCK What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible. 
__label__SPOCK We are considered simplistic, but in the process of evolving into a higher order. 
__label__SPOCK Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy? 
__label__SPOCK I read no evidence of malfunction. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK That is your father's wish? 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard. 
__label__SPOCK I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner. 
__label__SPOCK No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason. 
__label__SPOCK Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically. 
__label__SPOCK Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you. 
__label__SPOCK Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment. 
__label__SPOCK Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object! 
__label__SPOCK Captain Garth  GARTH: Lord Garth! 
__label__SPOCK I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable. 
__label__SPOCK Did he not several minutes later repeat that order? 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. An unidentifiable power. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden. 
__label__SPOCK Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Unless, of course, the random choice is the pattern. 
__label__SPOCK Stand by with full power. 
__label__SPOCK I find that most unusual, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him. 
__label__SPOCK Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK She is T'Pring. My wife. 
__label__SPOCK Begging your pardon, Captain, I think we should face the situation realistically. We are specimen animals in a zoo. And they have taken every precaution to prevent our escape. To them we are caged for life. We seem to be drawing quite a crowd. 
__label__SPOCK Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience. 
__label__SPOCK Thirty five. 
__label__SPOCK A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal. 
__label__SPOCK True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter. 
__label__SPOCK It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field. 
__label__SPOCK I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations  KIRK: I know the regulations against the killing of intelligent life forms, Mister Spock. But we don't know this life form is intelligent.
__label__SPOCK If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made. 
__label__SPOCK We'll know in a moment, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps. 
__label__SPOCK I'm afraid our navigational co-ordinates mean very little here, Lieutenant. My readings indicate we are not in time and space as we understand it. Doctor, these readings may interest you. 
__label__SPOCK Spock to Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control. 
__label__SPOCK First Officer out. Doctor, as senior officer present, I present myself to you for arrest.
__label__SPOCK Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in constantly questioning me on things you've already made up your mind about?
__label__SPOCK Governor. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledged. 
__label__SPOCK I beg your pardon? 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. The others are mere outcroppings. They suggest the peaks of submerged mountains. 
__label__SPOCK I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the phasers. Nor was its disappearance the type that would have been affected if it were using its cloaking device. 
__label__SPOCK War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we are being probed. 
__label__SPOCK More that direction, Engineer. 
__label__SPOCK Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time. 
__label__SPOCK I transported him myself. 
__label__SPOCK I am. 
__label__SPOCK He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend! 
__label__SPOCK I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible. 
__label__SPOCK Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony. 
__label__SPOCK Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them. 
__label__SPOCK Insults are effective only where emotion is present. 
__label__SPOCK Only a theory I have. 
__label__SPOCK They demand an immediate reply. 
__label__SPOCK Hmm. If we connect our two communicators in series, we can give off a high energy burst which might work, but it will also render the communicators powerless in a very short time. 
__label__SPOCK Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. I am triangulating now. It's coming from the engineering section. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. Let me check that engine. A very simple problem, easy to correct. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through.
__label__SPOCK Which has now become defective and is failing to operate. 
__label__SPOCK Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long time, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter. 
__label__SPOCK Ten minutes fourteen point twenty one seconds, Captain. We shall arrive with only moments to spare. We will need to disconnect the tractor beam at the appropriate time. 
__label__SPOCK Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
__label__SPOCK If we could force another appearance of this creature  VANDERBERG: When that creature appears, men die. 
__label__SPOCK We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter our shields completely. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously. 
__label__SPOCK Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here?
__label__SPOCK Spock here. Are you all right, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long. A few hours at best. 
__label__SPOCK There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense. 
__label__SPOCK Strongly indicated. 
__label__SPOCK That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan. 
__label__SPOCK I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it? 
__label__SPOCK Nine seconds. Eight, seven. Orbital velocity. 
__label__SPOCK Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right? 
__label__SPOCK Damage reports, Mister Stiles? 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Enough to warn other Earth ships.
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial, provided the creatures will permit it. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. It doesn't register. 
__label__SPOCK Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident? 
__label__SPOCK You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.
__label__SPOCK Admiral, the crew will not understand it. 
__label__SPOCK Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated expression. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further demonstration of M-5's capability. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK The necklace. 
__label__SPOCK Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed. 
__label__SPOCK Just a moment, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK What is the nature of the research? 
__label__SPOCK From what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could not evolve here. 
__label__SPOCK Illogical. 
__label__SPOCK All sections report ready, sir. 
__label__SPOCK Negative. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could accomplish its efficiency without sadism. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single ship cannot combat it. 
__label__SPOCK Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. 
__label__SPOCK The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. 
__label__SPOCK The wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium.
__label__SPOCK I believe so, Captain. There is a grid at the top of the brain core. It uses it to sense. We can escape the cloud through it. 
__label__SPOCK It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function. 
__label__SPOCK I did give a full report  KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, that was the past. I'm concerned with the present. Or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current information? 
__label__SPOCK No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Our landing party is intact, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further. 
__label__SPOCK There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding.
__label__SPOCK Such opportunities are extremely rare. 
__label__SPOCK He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? 
__label__SPOCK I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK And da Vinci? 
__label__SPOCK Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations.
__label__SPOCK No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made.
__label__SPOCK It would seem so. 
__label__SPOCK I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll have the readout in a moment. 
__label__SPOCK Sir? 
__label__SPOCK Far too close, Captain. I appreciate your action on my behalf, but your first duty is to the group and the mission. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using her voice. 
__label__SPOCK No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond  (Now it affects Kirk. Scott is already unconscious) 
__label__SPOCK Thank you. I shall not require much time. No more than twenty minutes, I should say. 
__label__SPOCK Bring it to the bridge at once, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Enterprise. Spock here.
__label__SPOCK What time period? 
__label__SPOCK I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship stopped in space. She appears to be drifting. 
__label__SPOCK Correct. Population approximately three billion and seven hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly. Estimated time of impact three hundred ninety six days. 
__label__SPOCK To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it. 
__label__SPOCK Remarkable. 
__label__SPOCK You guess? 
__label__SPOCK Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work of duplication. 
__label__SPOCK Correction, Captain. The ship was on a collision course only by coincidence. It is apparently heading for the heart of the Beta Niobe nova. 
__label__SPOCK It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, Captain, but far more complicated. 
__label__SPOCK I. Am. Nomad. I am performing my function. Deep emptiness, It approaches. Collision. Damage. Blackness. I. Am. The other. I am Tan Ru, Tan Ru. Nomad. Tan Ru. Error. Flaw. Imperfection. Must sterilise.
__label__SPOCK Shut them, Mister Sulu. 
__label__SPOCK Earth Outpost four reports they're under attack. A space vessel, identity unknown. 
__label__SPOCK You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant, did you see what happened? 
__label__SPOCK Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life. 
__label__SPOCK I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you. 
__label__SPOCK Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet. 
__label__SPOCK No, I don't think so. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants. 
__label__SPOCK I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy.  
__label__SPOCK Curious. Most illogical. 
__label__SPOCK I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate this time. 
__label__SPOCK No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, I believe you'll find the alien  KIRK: We damaged their ship. They destroyed themselves to avoid capture. Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab.
__label__SPOCK Do you believe you're in communication with the creature? 
__label__SPOCK Romulans, Captain. They were apparently lying in wait on the far side of that asteroid. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation. 
__label__SPOCK I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a fascinating project. 
__label__SPOCK Very astute, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK I presume you are the planet's master computer. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me. 
__label__SPOCK Exactly. It is like a huge bull grazing here and there in the pasture of the universe. 
__label__SPOCK Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational. Almost as if he were two men. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that much of a historian, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcan biology. 
__label__SPOCK This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will code mark for me. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir? 
__label__SPOCK Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? 
__label__SPOCK Opening time portals to the past. You cross through into the period which you were viewing. 
__label__SPOCK Explain. 
__label__SPOCK And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons. 
__label__SPOCK The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control. 
__label__SPOCK Indeed? Why did you marry her? 
__label__SPOCK Emergency! Full reverse power!
__label__SPOCK She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems. 
__label__SPOCK Where, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Continue the search. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you? 
__label__SPOCK I do not threaten, Captain. I merely state facts. I have found you to be an excellent officer. Our missions together have been both successful and profitable. However, I shall not permit your aberrations to jeopardise my position. 
__label__SPOCK Which supports a theory I've been formulating. 
__label__SPOCK Damage control reports, all stations! 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.
__label__SPOCK Between where we were and where we are. 
__label__SPOCK It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the streets. 
__label__SPOCK Bridge to Dispensary. 
__label__SPOCK Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before. 
__label__SPOCK A wise move, Captain. From what I can gather, even the Enterprise is no match for their force field. 
__label__SPOCK Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu.
__label__SPOCK Will you return? 
__label__SPOCK Wrong? 
__label__SPOCK The marriage party approaches. I hear them. 
__label__SPOCK The cloud is now only forty two minutes, fourteen seconds from Mantilles, Captain. And we have ascertained an important fact. This being does have a brain. 
__label__SPOCK It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not? 
__label__SPOCK We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here.
__label__SPOCK The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us. 
__label__SPOCK Destroy how? What? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office. 
__label__SPOCK My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts. 
__label__SPOCK As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision. 
__label__SPOCK I felt for him, too. 
__label__SPOCK This coral decoration for the aquarium is also shrinking. yet the meteoritic rock in there is unchanged. 
__label__SPOCK The power emanates from there. 
__label__SPOCK Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it! 
__label__SPOCK We can still manoeuvre. 
__label__SPOCK t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)
__label__SPOCK Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition. 
__label__SPOCK A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.
__label__SPOCK We can't use her ship to transport us, Captain, but we could use it as an unmanned ship with our tractor beam attached. 
__label__SPOCK I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped ourselves. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course.
__label__SPOCK Theirs. And it will take me some time to figure out how long that is. 
__label__SPOCK Undoubtedly. 
__label__SPOCK I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be in the medical lab.
__label__SPOCK Eight minutes, forty two seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Perhaps, Mister Boma. 
__label__SPOCK Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd you get this? 
__label__SPOCK I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I  KIRK: Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it. 
__label__SPOCK Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me. 
__label__SPOCK What's wrong? 
__label__SPOCK You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it. 
__label__SPOCK I have the phaser, Captain, and I do not intend to simply disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past. If you please.
__label__SPOCK Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.
__label__SPOCK Take these crystals to the Enterprise. 
__label__SPOCK It would have a very small field. 
__label__SPOCK They are all malfunctioning, Captain. Some kind of electronic block has cut us off from the ship. 
__label__SPOCK I'm called Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Coming within visual range now, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, allow me to escort this young man to his work area. 
__label__SPOCK Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've got this far. 
__label__SPOCK We can remain silent. 
__label__SPOCK James Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer. 
__label__SPOCK I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, the storm has caused some minor damage in your section. There are also injuries requiring your attention, Doctor. Well, gentlemen? 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the Romulan ships are overtaking us. At close range our deflectors will be unable to repel their attack. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings. 
__label__SPOCK Transfer to main viewer. 
__label__SPOCK Second vessel firing now, sir. 
__label__SPOCK We'll receive no help from the Organians. 
__label__SPOCK Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured. 
__label__SPOCK If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us. 
__label__SPOCK It is possible that this much of their technology survived.
__label__SPOCK Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven? 
__label__SPOCK We're still on our side, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would.
__label__SPOCK My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can find no exit out of here. 
__label__SPOCK Scans indicate that our forces and those of the Klingons are exactly equal at thirty eight each. The Klingons control deck six and starboard deck seven, while we control all sections above. 
__label__SPOCK Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe. 
__label__SPOCK It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no protective shields. 
__label__SPOCK Pure energy. Matter without form. 
__label__SPOCK Impossible, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I've never used it on a human, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft. 
__label__SPOCK Let me go alone, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, that's quite true. 
__label__SPOCK I also request McCoy accompany me. 
__label__SPOCK That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it. 
__label__SPOCK I do. And I stand by it. 
__label__SPOCK What is it, Nurse?
__label__SPOCK Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in the shelter? 
__label__SPOCK It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy. 
__label__SPOCK Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty Napoleons might still be alive? 
__label__SPOCK We searched the area. 
__label__SPOCK Status reports, all sections.
__label__SPOCK The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony. 
__label__SPOCK Not necessarily, Captain. They could have taken them for the same reason you would take a sharp object away from a child. 
__label__SPOCK True, his body was never found. 
__label__SPOCK Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven,  (The two ships rush towards the star) 
__label__SPOCK Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down there. 
__label__SPOCK Define. 
__label__SPOCK I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon. 
__label__SPOCK Use all ship's energy. Everything channelled to the shields.
__label__SPOCK Don't worry. You'll be safe, darling. 
__label__SPOCK We are fortunate none of the settings so far have been superior to the technology now available to the Federation. 
__label__SPOCK Tactically well planned. When the Federation investigates, we'll be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance. 
__label__SPOCK Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious. The universal myths, symbols. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised. 
__label__SPOCK The hexagonal shape of the windows suggests a similarity to natural insect designs of Earth, the honeycombs of bees. The individual cells are shaped precisely like this. 
__label__SPOCK However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more about this Balok. In some manner he was reminiscent of my father.
__label__SPOCK Yes. Very. 
__label__SPOCK Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates. 
__label__SPOCK There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out. 
__label__SPOCK The Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners. 
__label__SPOCK We could always throw tribbles at them. 
__label__SPOCK But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth. 
__label__SPOCK Fire. (several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire.
__label__SPOCK I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy? 
__label__SPOCK That was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when I was attacked by a wild animal. 
__label__SPOCK The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go. 
__label__SPOCK Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer. 
__label__SPOCK Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to you, and to your dressmaker. 
__label__SPOCK Main screen on, Lieutenant. 
__label__SPOCK The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end. 
__label__SPOCK That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter room.
__label__SPOCK May I point out, Captain  (Janice struggles with Coleman) 
__label__SPOCK Strange. It's not on the charts. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task. 
__label__SPOCK The Klingons? 
__label__SPOCK Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy? 
__label__SPOCK Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power.
__label__SPOCK Initiate. Warp factor two. 
__label__SPOCK It was from Van Gelder. He thought you'd like to know the treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed.
__label__SPOCK Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately 7,824.7 to 1. 
__label__SPOCK Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
__label__SPOCK A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable. 
__label__SPOCK There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless.
__label__SPOCK He's sneaked power down a bit.
__label__SPOCK The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation, and engineering functions. 
__label__SPOCK In fact, I do. But only to a certain point. 
__label__SPOCK Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac.
__label__SPOCK Quite ready, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away.
__label__SPOCK What is that, Doctor? 
__label__SPOCK Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK That should prove very interesting. 
__label__SPOCK I would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack. 
__label__SPOCK Recircuit power to engines. Maximum speed heading three seven mark zero one zero. 
__label__SPOCK So I would assume. 
__label__SPOCK I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is illogical. 
__label__SPOCK That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point. 
__label__SPOCK This is the First Officer speaking. Security, send an armed team to the Bridge. Transporter Room, stand by to beam Captain Kirk aboard.
__label__SPOCK I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan. 
__label__SPOCK The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.
__label__SPOCK Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Still undistinguishable. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly. 
__label__SPOCK The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock crystals, Doctor, until they attack. 
__label__SPOCK It leaves a visible trail. 
__label__SPOCK Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK There's a chance it may work, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK I understand. May I show you to your quarters? 
__label__SPOCK Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly? 
__label__SPOCK It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message. 
__label__SPOCK I am not questioning that, sir. 
__label__SPOCK A feeling is not much to go on. 
__label__SPOCK Scanners indicate it's some form of matter-energy whirlwind, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Not yet. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it. 
__label__SPOCK Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors indicate no solid substance. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own. 
__label__SPOCK Mister Spock. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot. 
__label__SPOCK He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. Activity without end, but with no volition. 
__label__SPOCK (twitching) Correct. 
__label__SPOCK Bring him aboard, Mister Scott. 
__label__SPOCK In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you give me warp eight? 
__label__SPOCK Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please? 
__label__SPOCK And what will become of Doctor Lester? 
__label__SPOCK Captain, look. 
__label__SPOCK Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? 
__label__SPOCK Dead?
__label__SPOCK (pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and examining it)
__label__SPOCK Captain, signs pointing the way. 
__label__SPOCK I believe there is, Captain. But not within me. I sensed something strange about the Klingons when we were aboard the Klothos.
__label__SPOCK I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome bodies. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you.
__label__SPOCK Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted. 
__label__SPOCK At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties. 
__label__SPOCK As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards. 
__label__SPOCK I didn't want to, Jim. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on Cheron. 
__label__SPOCK The photon torpedoes will not respond, either. The stasis field disables all higher-order field and warp functions. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively. 
__label__SPOCK Obviously, they can recharge their power in a matter of hours. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I  ATOZ: Oh, no, sir, no. I must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism. Return and make your selection. When you have chosen, I will prepare you through the atavachron. 
__label__SPOCK This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago.
__label__SPOCK The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours. 
__label__SPOCK You'll also find a report from the same hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his. 
__label__SPOCK Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy. 
__label__SPOCK There are not many places one could hide in here. 
__label__SPOCK Vulcan. Miss Chapel. 
__label__SPOCK Negative, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.
__label__SPOCK Under dozens of petty dictatorships. 
__label__SPOCK It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on Cheron. 
__label__SPOCK Just a moment. They're all beginning to call in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak to you. 
__label__SPOCK Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.
__label__SPOCK Yes. I will need a Vulcan desert soft suit and boots, and a small selection of streetwear circa 8877 Vulcan years. The carry bag should be of the same period. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We were sent here by mistake. 
__label__SPOCK We don't have the time to spare, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK Will you require assistance here? 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK But children become adults. 
__label__SPOCK At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My hobby. 
__label__SPOCK I don't know. 
__label__SPOCK He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did. 
__label__SPOCK Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual device. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here, Captain.
__label__SPOCK Captain, if you'll excuse me. 
__label__SPOCK Apparently, the natural laws of our universe don't operate here, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK They did, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK I don't see how. 
__label__SPOCK There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see, I've returned to the present in every sense. 
__label__SPOCK It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.
__label__SPOCK No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No! 
__label__SPOCK Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours.
__label__SPOCK Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK You don't dare take the chance, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Bridge to Captain Kirk. 
__label__SPOCK The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now. Are you standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him? 
__label__SPOCK Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power. 
__label__SPOCK Eight planets, Captain. That is the number in the Fabrina solar system. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, I heard, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK No, it appears to be conversing with them. A reasoning computer that small? 
__label__SPOCK No data yet. 
__label__SPOCK He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship. 
__label__SPOCK In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death.
__label__SPOCK Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?
__label__SPOCK This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility, violent intentions. 
__label__SPOCK Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments. 
__label__SPOCK Nurse. 
__label__SPOCK Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one.
__label__SPOCK Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down. 
__label__SPOCK No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy. That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy. 
__label__SPOCK Your agoniser, please. 
__label__SPOCK I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject. 
__label__SPOCK Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation. 
__label__SPOCK I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual check of every scientific expedition is routine. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for me to be the one  KIRK: Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan. 
__label__SPOCK The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is it? 
__label__SPOCK Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it. 
__label__SPOCK As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK Here, let me help you, Sergeant. It's operated with this dial here. 
__label__SPOCK It's re-rigged. Hurry. 
__label__SPOCK Compute the next period of spatial interphase. 
__label__SPOCK Sir? 
__label__SPOCK Standing by for instructions.
__label__SPOCK And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on  BAILEY: The cube's range and position. I'll have it by then. Raising my voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job. It means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.
__label__SPOCK Spock out.
__label__SPOCK This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. 
__label__SPOCK Hmm. Just as I thought. 
__label__SPOCK Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out the lower levels. There seems to be no one aboard. Only uniforms. 
__label__SPOCK I cannot, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen hundred Benecia time. 
__label__SPOCK For what purpose, Mister Scott? 
__label__SPOCK Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone. 
__label__SPOCK The Huron's power levels are at bare minimum for life support, Captain. I'm picking up metallic debris. 
__label__SPOCK Telepathy, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Open your mind. We move together. Our minds sharing the same thoughts.
__label__SPOCK It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case  MCCOY: Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mister Spock? 
__label__SPOCK Seal the windows! 
__label__SPOCK Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal.
__label__SPOCK Where do they keep the equipment? I could use my tricorder. 
__label__SPOCK The Romulan ships have halted their attack. Apparently the sight of a spacecraft twenty times their size has given them second thoughts.
__label__SPOCK Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve. 
__label__SPOCK If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be able to help. 
__label__SPOCK It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off it. 
__label__SPOCK How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you? 
__label__SPOCK Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated.
__label__SPOCK It never would have reached the museum, Lieutenant. There was too much power in that one setting. If not the Kzinti, the Klingons or some other species would have tried to possess it. 
__label__SPOCK He's gone. Constellation, come in, please. 
__label__SPOCK We can't, Captain. Transporter is out again. 
__label__SPOCK No, nothing. 
__label__SPOCK Impact in ninety three seconds. Ninety two. Ninety one. 
__label__SPOCK Heading directly toward us at warp speed. 
__label__SPOCK I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will acquaint myself with our supplies. 
__label__SPOCK (examining a roll of film) Poor photography. 
__label__SPOCK It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment. 
__label__SPOCK These are not Enterprise communicators, Captain. They are fakes.
__label__SPOCK Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our answer on this screen, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain? 
__label__SPOCK Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic. 
__label__SPOCK Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you read, Enterprise? 
__label__SPOCK We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's circling as if searching for something. 
__label__SPOCK Your report, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK It appears we have accidentally intercepted someone's transporter beam, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain. 
__label__SPOCK Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in case.
__label__SPOCK But there is, Captain. Ourselves. And there may be other things guarding the Soul of Alar.
__label__SPOCK The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages.
__label__SPOCK Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise controls. 
__label__SPOCK You have one minute and twenty three seconds. 
__label__SPOCK Electronically sophisticated devices. I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there. 
__label__SPOCK I've given you the facts, Doctor. 
__label__SPOCK I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation considerably. 
__label__SPOCK Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns. 
__label__SPOCK Welcome aboard, Captain. Sensors show all energy sources deactivated. It's quite dead. 
__label__SPOCK You must be close to the portal. 
__label__SPOCK Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor. 
__label__SPOCK I am very small. And there are many of me. We are in a spaceship within you. 
__label__SPOCK Or a deep psychosis. 
__label__SPOCK Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high ground. (fizzing sound and smoke) They've locked on to my tricorder. 
__label__SPOCK I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode.
__label__SPOCK Captain, fight it. Fight it as hard as you can. They think too fast in too complex a manner. If he gives up for even one moment, he may go mad. 
__label__SPOCK Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. 
__label__SPOCK However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted. 
__label__SPOCK I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx. 
__label__SPOCK Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite.
__label__SPOCK And again, check. 
__label__SPOCK There is no sensor failure. The readings persist. 
__label__SPOCK I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable.
__label__SPOCK You've not yet explained the nature of this thing. 
__label__SPOCK Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant  CHRISTOPHER: Wait a minute. I don't have a son. 
__label__SPOCK And you will continue to check in every four hours?
__label__SPOCK Sound alarm.
__label__SPOCK My own concern is more immediate. The boy. 
__label__SPOCK Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude. 
__label__SPOCK Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate. 
__label__SPOCK Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary. 
__label__SPOCK Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired. We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment. I, therefore, request permission  [Council chamber]
__label__SPOCK Correct, Captain. 
__label__SPOCK Commodore. 
__label__SPOCK Spock here. 
__label__SPOCK Captain, the extreme long-range sensors show something in the Zone. At this distance, I cannot determine precisely what it is. It could be a trading vessel like Winston's. But it does not seem prudent to take the risk of trespass into the Zone. 
__label__SPOCK There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the room so the board can vote  KIRK: Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship. The most fool thing I ever heard of. Competency hearing when there's work to be done. I'll be in my quarters, awaiting your decision. (leaves) 
__label__SPOCK Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
__label__MCCOY No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked with them. Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence. 
__label__MCCOY So are you, sir. Well, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY You listen to me, young woman. I'll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Sulu. I'm worried about Uhura. 
__label__MCCOY Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of. 
__label__MCCOY The force field of his belt won't hold that weight for long, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY And your crew?
__label__MCCOY Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any comment about those ears? 
__label__MCCOY We're being observed, watched. 
__label__MCCOY The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to Bridge. 
__label__MCCOY I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man? 
__label__MCCOY You bet your pointed ears I am. Ready whenever you are, Captain.
__label__MCCOY Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can.
__label__MCCOY She's dead. 
__label__MCCOY Only a few months. We found them totally uninterested in medical aid or hospitals. They believe only the strong should survive. 
__label__MCCOY Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation. 
__label__MCCOY You did. 
__label__MCCOY Take him? Take him where? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin. 
__label__MCCOY That's not Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I know what a movie is, but. 
__label__MCCOY It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say? 
__label__MCCOY Too late. All of this, just an illusion. 
__label__MCCOY Sir? Are you all right?
__label__MCCOY Hypo. 
__label__MCCOY That's a nasty cut, Jim. Does it hurt? 
__label__MCCOY No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to transporter room. 
__label__MCCOY What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Magnolias in blossom. Beautiful. 
__label__MCCOY There used to be a story about a modern Diogenes wandering the galaxy looking for someone special. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. You lie still. I'll check her out right away. 
__label__MCCOY Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real thing. 
__label__MCCOY None. 
__label__MCCOY But there is. 
__label__MCCOY What are you doing with those things, DeSalle? 
__label__MCCOY Maybe they're waiting for the mist to clear. (it clears) Well, how about that. Great granddaddy's weed spray still works. 
__label__MCCOY That cat. 
__label__MCCOY We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should have him climbing the walls. 
__label__MCCOY It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain. 
__label__MCCOY What in the name of? 
__label__MCCOY No. There's no mention of it. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain. He'll be happy to hear that. 
__label__MCCOY But you don't just throw him to the wolves. 
__label__MCCOY Miles? Are you joking? 
__label__MCCOY What about the Captain? We can't leave  DECKER: Doctor, you may leave the Bridge. 
__label__MCCOY Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint. 
__label__MCCOY Are we sure, Jim? A number of the crew are acting as strange as Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting. 
__label__MCCOY Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker. Suppose that has anything to do with the interference? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, that's right. By a knight in shining armour of all things, but what  SPOCK: Since the planet's power source is underground, it seems only logical that Doctor McCoy was somehow transported there and repaired. 
__label__MCCOY Two thirds of the personnel are affected. 
__label__MCCOY Nancy. 
__label__MCCOY Wife? 
__label__MCCOY I think it's after you, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY You haven't aged a day. Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it. 
__label__MCCOY No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not. 
__label__MCCOY I thought the power was off in the galley.
__label__MCCOY What's the use of being a doctor, anyway? We're only as good as our drugs and technology make us. Underneath all the tricks, I might as well be practising in the Middle Ages. 
__label__MCCOY What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise? 
__label__MCCOY I'm all right. Are you all right, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?
__label__MCCOY You all right? 
__label__MCCOY I intend to stay on this ship, with these people, whatever happens. 
__label__MCCOY Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this? 
__label__MCCOY I should have never reconnected his mouth. 
__label__MCCOY If its pull is this strong, Jim, how do we get out of orbit? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, the Enterprise broke free. 
__label__MCCOY I would like to remedy that situation. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Dispensary to Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius. But then he will have lost total resentment toward women. 
__label__MCCOY (looking at the schematic on the monitor) That's not the same. 
__label__MCCOY Tell him, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Now, Scotty. Have medics stand by. 
__label__MCCOY Can the zenite be affecting him? 
__label__MCCOY All of my old friends look like doctors. All of his look like you. Well, you might as well join me for a drink. With this inquiry coming up, he's going to need all the friends he can get.
__label__MCCOY And you've brought our furry friends down on us. 
__label__MCCOY Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born! 
__label__MCCOY One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt. 
__label__MCCOY I'll let you know. 
__label__MCCOY We're floating inside the cloud. 
__label__MCCOY I suggest that we get these seawater and algae specimens.
__label__MCCOY We come with open hearts and hands. 
__label__MCCOY Don't fight the force field. There's something about it that upsets the body metabolism. 
__label__MCCOY I wonder why they let me keep it. 
__label__MCCOY What? 
__label__MCCOY Amen to that, Scotty.
__label__MCCOY Definitely drugged, almost comatose. 
__label__MCCOY What can I do for you, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY I think so. 
__label__MCCOY They're giants, and we're insects beside them. They could destroy us without meaning to. And all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command, too. Coincidence? 
__label__MCCOY Leave medicine to medical men, Captain. You found no fountain of youth here. People live longer here now because it's natural for them to. 
__label__MCCOY Forget it, Spock. It won't work. 
__label__MCCOY And that became Lincoln? 
__label__MCCOY And beautiful. 
__label__MCCOY It's a tri-ox compound. It'll help you breathe. Now be careful! 
__label__MCCOY These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim's illness. 
__label__MCCOY All right, it's worked so far, but we're not out yet. 
__label__MCCOY I'm glad to see him under guard, Jim. If he'd turned into a second Spock, it would've been too much to take. 
__label__MCCOY I'll drink to that. What emotion? 
__label__MCCOY Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental. 
__label__MCCOY No, I'm not. 
__label__MCCOY Never trusted this. 
__label__MCCOY Scotty doesn't believe in gods. 
__label__MCCOY Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?
__label__MCCOY I have a patient here with many questions, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY I don't make house calls. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it off. 
__label__MCCOY (helping her back into her seat) Upsy-daisy. 
__label__MCCOY Perhaps they weren't expecting us. 
__label__MCCOY What's that? 
__label__MCCOY Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance? 
__label__MCCOY And if we fight them, we all die. We know that. 
__label__MCCOY If the Enterprise has been destroyed, you know how long we can survive. 
__label__MCCOY Is it the captain, Mister Spock?
__label__MCCOY Spock, you're obviously not yourself. Maybe some rest. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Jim. We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test. 
__label__MCCOY We've triggered something, all right. His heart beat's increasing. Now passing eight beats per minute. There are some signs of respiration beginning. 
__label__MCCOY What's wrong? 
__label__MCCOY You're both out of your heads! 
__label__MCCOY A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser! 
__label__MCCOY Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY How long have you had that thing, Lieutenant? 
__label__MCCOY All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Right wrist. 
__label__MCCOY Well. 
__label__MCCOY You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find him. 
__label__MCCOY Mine too, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, are you alive? 
__label__MCCOY No. 
__label__MCCOY Tell the captain what you told me. 
__label__MCCOY It's unbelievable. 
__label__MCCOY You speak in strange whispers. This is not the way of Landru. 
__label__MCCOY Where are your storms, Jaeger? 
__label__MCCOY They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we delaying here? 
__label__MCCOY Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging. 
__label__MCCOY We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were dead, and we  (Mira runs to see) 
__label__MCCOY You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders. You'll be busted  KIRK: I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend.
__label__MCCOY All right, I'll show you how to work the selector. 
__label__MCCOY I'll, er, I'll wait for the professor and I'll catch you both at once. 
__label__MCCOY All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for. 
__label__MCCOY How could it be gone? What the devil does that mean, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY What's that? 
__label__MCCOY Prefect, the psycho-tricorder will require privacy to be effective. 
__label__MCCOY Would you like to use a butterfly net on him, Captain? 
__label__MCCOY She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead, Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill! 
__label__MCCOY Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable. 
__label__MCCOY And, of course, your people found an answer.
__label__MCCOY Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider. 
__label__MCCOY That's enough. We know what was said. 
__label__MCCOY How do you feel? 
__label__MCCOY Don't be a fool. My hands and face are frostbitten. I can't feel my feet. Alone you have a chance. Now do what I say. Go try to find Jim. 
__label__MCCOY On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I just saw a large rabbit  [Kirk's quarters]
__label__MCCOY Don't reproduce? 
__label__MCCOY Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise. 
__label__MCCOY My readings keep shifting. It must be the activity of that blasted aurora. 
__label__MCCOY We all know one another and Landru. 
__label__MCCOY What's this? 
__label__MCCOY I can't. I got to keep moving. I can't let them find me. 
__label__MCCOY Not a one. What happened is medically impossible. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock! 
__label__MCCOY And they still go mad at this time. Perhaps the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time. 
__label__MCCOY Well, in that case, you got a bargain. 
__label__MCCOY They're answering. (static) Did you get a fix on that, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY We can't just sit here. 
__label__MCCOY It must've worked. 
__label__MCCOY Not too big for the Enterprise to handle if it has to. 
__label__MCCOY I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks. 
__label__MCCOY Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere. 
__label__MCCOY A message from three hundred million years ago? 
__label__MCCOY He's dead, Captain.
__label__MCCOY Are you out of your mind? 
__label__MCCOY No, not everything. That spot, I spilt acid there a year ago.
__label__MCCOY You speak very strangely, friend. Are you from away? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition. In spite of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a few variations. However, there's an extra organ in his chest that I can't even make a guess about. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock is, er, under arrest. Is confinement to quarters enough?
__label__MCCOY Jim, did you see what I saw? 
__label__MCCOY I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him.
__label__MCCOY The same. Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body. It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove. 
__label__MCCOY Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, don't you think KIRK: What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me.
__label__MCCOY This man has no salt in his body at all. 
__label__MCCOY What? 
__label__MCCOY He'll have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre. Right now he's under sedation and heavy restraints. 
__label__MCCOY Excuse me. 
__label__MCCOY Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours.
__label__MCCOY Van Gelder's still violently agitated, Captain.
__label__MCCOY A cage is a cage, Jim.
__label__MCCOY I don't know. 
__label__MCCOY Absolutely. No birds, no mammals, no insects, nothing. I'm certain our readings weren't off.
__label__MCCOY It appears he will, Lieutenant. (leaves) 
__label__MCCOY Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I want to talk to you. 
__label__MCCOY That's different. Marvick loved her. 
__label__MCCOY You saw how capricious he is. Benevolent one minute, angry the next. One more wrong move from her and he could kill her. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. Jim! May we please have a word with you? 
__label__MCCOY He'll live or die now, Jim. I don't know which. Doctor M'Benga interned on a Vulcan ward. He couldn't be in better hands. 
__label__MCCOY I can't give you any guarantee. 
__label__MCCOY Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the stuff on the end? It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times stronger. 
__label__MCCOY You really think it's that serious? 
__label__MCCOY The Argelian empathic contact? 
__label__MCCOY I won't shoot Nancy. 
__label__MCCOY Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here. But do one or the other now. 
__label__MCCOY According to the ship's log, the medical surgeon down here didn't even know what was going on. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here.
__label__MCCOY Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder.
__label__MCCOY Mind if I come in? 
__label__MCCOY Jim? Jim. Who hit you? 
__label__MCCOY Who cares what started it, Mister Spock. We're in it! Murderers.
__label__MCCOY Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no reason for it to attack us. 
__label__MCCOY Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space legends. There's no intelligent life here. 
__label__MCCOY He may still need the ship's medical stores. Why prevent contact? 
__label__MCCOY There certainly does. Your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter. In fact it went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter! 
__label__MCCOY What's that? 
__label__MCCOY Did you see them?
__label__MCCOY Help it? I cured it. 
__label__MCCOY So they take all the credit here. Poppycock! Answer me. Do you want my help? Answer me. Do you want my help? (she nods) All right. Say to yourself, The child is mine. The child is mine. It is mine! 
__label__MCCOY Hey, Jim, look. Scotty and a search party. 
__label__MCCOY No. That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions continue. But there is no mind. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship. 
__label__MCCOY Not Captain Kirk. 
__label__MCCOY Is this how we lost contact with the first landing party? 
__label__MCCOY Well, there's always that possibility. I'll go over them again if you like. 
__label__MCCOY Stop. Winded?
__label__MCCOY His genes. All right, nurse. Prepare Chekov for another complete physical. 
__label__MCCOY There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams. Now, I can't trace it down in my biocomps. Spock won't tell me what it is. But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him. 
__label__MCCOY Just what the doctor ordered. 
__label__MCCOY There is something compelling about it. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. It's all right. We can help them now. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right. 
__label__MCCOY What's his problem, Commodore?
__label__MCCOY The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word because it's what you wanted to believe? 
__label__MCCOY But tell me, what reason would he have to lie if there are Thasians? 
__label__MCCOY What's the matter, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in nature. 
__label__MCCOY Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office. 
__label__MCCOY This is like coming home. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, careful. 
__label__MCCOY I'm glad to hear it. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not sure I can. 
__label__MCCOY Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer.
__label__MCCOY Then your makers weren't humanoid? 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Jim. The lab, the science departments, we're all stumped. 
__label__MCCOY Is something wrong, Miss Chapel? 
__label__MCCOY Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last. 
__label__MCCOY You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch. 
__label__MCCOY You can't. 
__label__MCCOY Oh! Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too. You never give up hoping, do you? 
__label__MCCOY What about the Captain?
__label__MCCOY Sorry, Jim. The lock may or may not have been picked. It would be hard to tell even with the tricorder. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, I find that shocking. 
__label__MCCOY Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of respiration. 
__label__MCCOY Neither do I. He's in perfect health. 
__label__MCCOY I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it? 
__label__MCCOY Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves? 
__label__MCCOY Would you like to take a crack at it? 
__label__MCCOY Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, no. I'm quite all right, thank you. 
__label__MCCOY You're fine, Joe. Up and out of there.
__label__MCCOY She's a mute, Jim. No vocal cords, not even vestigals. And I don't think it's a pathological condition. 
__label__MCCOY You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds. 
__label__MCCOY That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more.
__label__MCCOY Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've worked on  SPOCK: The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did. 
__label__MCCOY That would give a mechanical reading. I'm getting nothing. 
__label__MCCOY I know that. But I've never known Spock to act like a pal under any circumstances, least of all toward Klingons. 
__label__MCCOY Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back. 
__label__MCCOY Why? The probe has a range of  KIRK: With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometres. We must be exactly on target, because we won't have a second chance. Bones, time for another stimulant. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what in heaven's name is going on? 
__label__MCCOY You don't have the choice. 
__label__MCCOY Well, some are off and some aren't. It has to be our error. Come on. We'll start from the beginning and this time we're going to find the answer. 
__label__MCCOY No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles. 
__label__MCCOY He's as stubborn as ever. (laughs)  
__label__MCCOY He's dying, and I can't stop it. 
__label__MCCOY But we still have some doubts up here, Captain. Can you tell us any more?
__label__MCCOY Yes. There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite pinpoint it. 
__label__MCCOY To whatever you want the most, Miranda. 
__label__MCCOY No, I never say that, either.
__label__MCCOY Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost confidence in you? 
__label__MCCOY Sulu!
__label__MCCOY Jim, with all the systems out we'll only have enough air and heat for  KIRK: Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering. 
__label__MCCOY No, no, Mister Spock. You place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here to support its head. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY You have what you wanted most. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. 
__label__MCCOY I'd rather not put it on the speaker. 
__label__MCCOY Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you.
__label__MCCOY Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here. I'd like to see you in it. Why don't you put it on?
__label__MCCOY Seems logical to me. 
__label__MCCOY It'll take more than logic to get us out of this. 
__label__MCCOY You have all the symptoms of the bends. Nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain. Now how would one get the bends down here? 
__label__MCCOY If we could only find the proper filtering agent, we might be able to solve this problem. Negative. It's the third failure. 
__label__MCCOY He'll live. 
__label__MCCOY We've been travelling for hours. Where are they taking us? 
__label__MCCOY I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required  KIRK: Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder? 
__label__MCCOY You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway. Lieutenant Galway? 
__label__MCCOY It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY And you and Mister Spock, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet. 
__label__MCCOY How? 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY McCoy, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know what it is, exactly. She seems very vulnerable. 
__label__MCCOY Without my instruments, it's difficult to make an exact diagnosis. Rough guess is a malarial type infection caused by an insect bite. I can't do anything without my medikit. 
__label__MCCOY We'll get home. This won't take long. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what kind of power must she have? 
__label__MCCOY Oh. You will pardon us. 
__label__MCCOY Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago. 
__label__MCCOY Jim  SPOCK: Captain, I  KIRK: Gentlemen, I'll decide.
__label__MCCOY Assuming we get out of this, Captain KIRK: Nobody's given up yet.
__label__MCCOY I was simply trying to avoid an argument. (takes the scalpel)
__label__MCCOY Spock, do you ever say anything straight out? 
__label__MCCOY Yeoman? 
__label__MCCOY First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be an occasion like this.
__label__MCCOY He doesn't know about trick or treat. 
__label__MCCOY They do not exist. 
__label__MCCOY He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.
__label__MCCOY Now this isn't going to hurt a bit. 
__label__MCCOY There's no such thing as a safe tribble. 
__label__MCCOY Because that's your name. 
__label__MCCOY It's getting critical. There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks. Even Scotty's being affected. If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise out of here. 
__label__MCCOY Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Oh, yes. Of course.
__label__MCCOY My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of duty.
__label__MCCOY There's something wrong, Jim. Their nervous systems. Unconscious like this, there should be just routine autonomic activity, but I'm getting a very high reading, as though even in their unconscious state, they're being violently stimulated. 
__label__MCCOY In the long history of medicine, no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of a play. Riley, don't forget to (but he's not there) 
__label__MCCOY Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet? 
__label__MCCOY The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead. 
__label__MCCOY The wound is completely healed. It fits, Jim. She must be an empath. Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions. They become part of her. 
__label__MCCOY It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't sanction it. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse. That's the second time he's come out of it. Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us. 
__label__MCCOY Well, say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative powers ditto. As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch. Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of that wound on his forehead. Not even a bruise. It was like he had never been injured. 
__label__MCCOY Its metabolic rate. It's impossibly high as if it's burning itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes.
__label__MCCOY It must be a malfunction. This is a barren world. There's hardly any vegetation, no apparent animal life. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship's computers. 
__label__MCCOY Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history. 
__label__MCCOY Only one. Tomlinson. The boy who was getting married this morning. His fiancée is at the chapel. 
__label__MCCOY Perhaps your presence will quiet her. 
__label__MCCOY Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing. 
__label__MCCOY One life. 
__label__MCCOY Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator. 
__label__MCCOY That won't be long enough. 
__label__MCCOY A veritable zoo of bacteria. Beam down a biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope. If I'm dealing with viruses, I'll need better equipment than I have here.
__label__MCCOY That's true. Fear would naturally be her first reaction. Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, the analysis of this so far is potassium thirty five percent, carbon eighteen percent, phosphorous one point zero, calcium one point five. Jim, the crew didn't leave. They're still here. 
__label__MCCOY Familiars? 
__label__MCCOY Then I bandaged it, I stepped into this room for just a moment  KIRK: Bones, I've got a lot of things to do. Get to the point. 
__label__MCCOY He's dead, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Do you think we belong to you? 
__label__MCCOY Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of course you know that. Why? 
__label__MCCOY You heard correctly, Jim. These people killed each other. 
__label__MCCOY I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary. 
__label__MCCOY I wish we hadn't had to do this. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you, sir. 
__label__MCCOY Well, they're not. After what they've been through they really should  KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior to any mechanical device.
__label__MCCOY No dizziness? No sweating? No palpitations? 
__label__MCCOY What's your attitude on that, Doctor? 
__label__MCCOY Were you able to make sense our of the symbols? 
__label__MCCOY Open your mouth. 
__label__MCCOY If this doesn't work, we could lose you and Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Traitors! 
__label__MCCOY The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu? 
__label__MCCOY Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook. Have you ever been told that? 
__label__MCCOY I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer. 
__label__MCCOY That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over five years. 
__label__MCCOY When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's fighting to get the answers out. As though something is exerting pain to stop her. 
__label__MCCOY When is that interphase going to happen? 
__label__MCCOY I said you were excused, Nurse. Please, Christine. I promise you I'll give the Captain a full report. 
__label__MCCOY Could they be aliens projecting an illusion? 
__label__MCCOY I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. It will be interesting to see if his brain matches his body. 
__label__MCCOY I've triple-checked, Jim. I wish to God I was wrong. Spock's blood is copper-based. The infection enters the blood stream, and encases the cells so they can't carry oxygen. 
__label__MCCOY I think they perform the same function as teeth. They break up the larger chunks of matter for digestion. 
__label__MCCOY I  KIRK: Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship. What is it? What's the matter? 
__label__MCCOY You were about to make a medical comment, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Spock, we've got to do something! 
__label__MCCOY No, it doesn't. It's still a fancy way of saying that you're playing a hunch. well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead or alive and I still want another search. 
__label__MCCOY Let's jump him. 
__label__MCCOY And lastly, myself. 
__label__MCCOY Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Why didn't she kill you? 
__label__MCCOY This is ridiculous. There's nothing out there. Nothing at all. 
__label__MCCOY Where the devil are they? 
__label__MCCOY We'd be fools if we didn't know that. But we also have been using our minds and trying to learn to live in peace. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I, er, I'm sorry. It does hurt, doesn't it? 
__label__MCCOY Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared.
__label__MCCOY Spock! Are you all right? 
__label__MCCOY His pulse is fading. (turns pink again) Pulse and heart normal.
__label__MCCOY Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's wife, she said there was something in that root. She said now you can refuse her nothing. 
__label__MCCOY Not this time, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Sehlat? 
__label__MCCOY I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you  KIRK: Go ahead. 
__label__MCCOY Well, confine him.
__label__MCCOY Very dead, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the early symptoms. There'll be more. 
__label__MCCOY So?
__label__MCCOY Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, are you beaming down?
__label__MCCOY At least I've got my medical kit, for all the good it is. 
__label__MCCOY There's no question about it, Spock. I want you to take a look at this. The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups.
__label__MCCOY Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps? 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead. 
__label__MCCOY Do you have any idea of the risk? 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet, but there's one thing that I have discovered. 
__label__MCCOY What is it? What's wrong? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will give us the truth. 
__label__MCCOY Miss Chapel. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year. 
__label__MCCOY Agreed. Once they've got it into their heads we're showing force, you can forget them signing any mining treaty. 
__label__MCCOY I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this. 
__label__MCCOY Blessed be the Body, and health to all of its parts. 
__label__MCCOY And the punishment is death? 
__label__MCCOY A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY No, I don't think so. I think I ought to stay clear. 
__label__MCCOY Some heart flutter. Better risk a few drops of cordrazine. 
__label__MCCOY Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you, Mister Spock, for bringing back the knowledge of the Fabrini. 
__label__MCCOY Zero eight three. 
__label__MCCOY That's enough. That's enough. Your heart will last forever, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted. 
__label__MCCOY If the universal translator is right, the substance in your bloodstream is similar to the ambergris of Earth whales. Reverse mutation is induced by infusion of an antitoxin, concentrated doses of it. 
__label__MCCOY Now, just a minute. I can't let you, whatever you are, inject him with some alien dew drop! 
__label__MCCOY Nancy, er  NANCY: My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But you're tired, You need to rest. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream. The more the organism eats, the more inert matter is built up. So after two or three days, they reached a point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive. 
__label__MCCOY That's a laugh. 
__label__MCCOY I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us. It's in that direction, and it doesn't read solid. It's more unstable, tenuous, like a collection of gases. 
__label__MCCOY Or do you want to go through life looking like your First Officer? 
__label__MCCOY There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure. 
__label__MCCOY We've done it, Jim. They're gone. 
__label__MCCOY There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets. Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister Spock. It's a relief. 
__label__MCCOY And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors. My assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man. How long it would take him to pass out from the pain. 
__label__MCCOY Sensors just gave us an update reading, Scotty. There's a seaquake due in that area, a bad one. Complete topography changes. 
__label__MCCOY Well, something like Melenex might do the trick. Brief unconsciousness and temporary skin discolouration. It looks worse than it is. 
__label__MCCOY Strange you didn't get a voice reply. 
__label__MCCOY The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity.
__label__MCCOY Well, if all the shouting's over up there, I'd like for you to report to Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies, as near as I can tell. 
__label__MCCOY And my dear friend Scotty. And that pretty little Lieutenant Uhura. I've saved just about everybody on this here ship. If the Enterprise had a heart, I'd save her too. Now, let's talk about your heart, my dear. 
__label__MCCOY Help me get him on the table. Well, come on. Help me get him on the table. He'll die without immediate treatment. 
__label__MCCOY Some neural damage. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY Hi, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I'm sure he'd like to feel the same way about you, Anne, but that may be impossible. Five years, that's a long time. People change. 
__label__MCCOY Then I need a drink. 
__label__MCCOY Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers. Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him? 
__label__MCCOY She's perfectly healthy. Heart like a hammer, respiration normal, blood pressure normal. This is medically impossible. 
__label__MCCOY But he's suffering from a severe concussion. 
__label__MCCOY Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship Farragut. Eleven years ago, you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked. According to the tapes, this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself. 
__label__MCCOY If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely. But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do. Spock's body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support. 
__label__MCCOY You shook hands with him, Jim. His flesh was warm. He's alive.
__label__MCCOY Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding? 
__label__MCCOY Taos Lightning straight bourbon. Try some. In small amounts, it was considered medicinal. 
__label__MCCOY Nevertheless, we're still in business and I propose a toast to a narrow escape. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you can see for yourself, he's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion. 
__label__MCCOY Physically, there's nothing wrong with you. 
__label__MCCOY He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two.
__label__MCCOY Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm. They can only kill me once for touching her. 
__label__MCCOY Fantastic machine, the M-5. No off switch. 
__label__MCCOY I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer. 
__label__MCCOY Is the power level still holding, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY You're in (a squeeze makes him lower his voice) You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat. 
__label__MCCOY To coin a phrase, fascinating. 
__label__MCCOY You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic. 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it? 
__label__MCCOY You mean you don't know whether you're going to be able to recover the Captain or not? 
__label__MCCOY Okay, I admit it's an effective bluff, but so what? As soon as they figure it out, they'll destroy the balloon and us. 
__label__MCCOY Then you don't think they'll find us. 
__label__MCCOY Put him over there. 
__label__MCCOY They acted out of ignorance, Natira. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, you know as well as I do what we've all just been through. 
__label__MCCOY I've found a tape in the computer down here, and when I try to read it, all I get is a whine. 
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I suppose so. 
__label__MCCOY The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mister Spock. The cause is the area of space we're in. It's affecting the whole crew.
__label__MCCOY They're crying, Jim. I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep. 
__label__MCCOY Like a hawk. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators. Without them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't have a chance.
__label__MCCOY I'm with you, Captain. She awed me. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to Captain Kirk. 
__label__MCCOY I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mister Spock,  SPOCK: I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law. 
__label__MCCOY Does that mean they all tried to build something like this? 
__label__MCCOY If you can get to it, Spock  [Kirk's quarters]
__label__MCCOY I'm not sure I can take too much of this. 
__label__MCCOY It's what the doctor ordered, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Well, I don't know. Maybe trial  KIRK: Maybe. There's no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know now. 
__label__MCCOY Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?
__label__MCCOY I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock.
__label__MCCOY Nurse Chapel, what in the devil? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, why no briefing on this? I'd at least like to know what we're getting into. 
__label__MCCOY What have you got, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us, we will lose Spock. 
__label__MCCOY I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don Juans to fight off. And me, too.
__label__MCCOY They hate captivity. You try to put more than one hand on them and they throw off a charge of two thousand volts. How did you ever capture it? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, did you know who that woman was? 
__label__MCCOY Simple humanoid, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Well, what happened to that leg? 
__label__MCCOY Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight bruise or two, our Captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse. He'll be coming out of it in a minute or two. 
__label__MCCOY Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect? 
__label__MCCOY Can we beam the captain and Spock back up? 
__label__MCCOY As of this date, lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship. 
__label__MCCOY What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back the dead, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY She called this the world. These people don't know they're on a spaceship. 
__label__MCCOY Is this your brother, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY No, just surprised. It isn't every day a dinosaur falls on you.
__label__MCCOY But how do they keep the line going? 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Captain Kirk. Captain's presence for examination is requested. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows.
__label__MCCOY Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical. 
__label__MCCOY He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly. 
__label__MCCOY Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they? 
__label__MCCOY The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic emotional structure. You had one once before. Now I need another one to compare with that previous test. There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths. Over here, Captain.
__label__MCCOY Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress. Now we all know that. 
__label__MCCOY No, no. You've got it all wrong. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to lab. Anything new on those bios? 
__label__MCCOY Oh, yes. Yes, I do. 
__label__MCCOY What for? 
__label__MCCOY You can't stay here. You can't survive without the spores. After you've cleared at the Starbase, you could be relocated. It depends upon what you want. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe not the same one. I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought. 
__label__MCCOY Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be. 
__label__MCCOY Sargon. 
__label__MCCOY You're not going to answer my question, are you?
__label__MCCOY Just as I thought. It can come anytime now. 
__label__MCCOY Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse. 
__label__MCCOY Do we violate the treaty, Captain? 
__label__MCCOY Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now. 
__label__MCCOY Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours. 
__label__MCCOY Who, me? 
__label__MCCOY Cardio-stimulate. 
__label__MCCOY Stop it, Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Then tell him. 
__label__MCCOY I think I've found it. 
__label__MCCOY How do you do? What in blazes is this? 
__label__MCCOY Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records as simple fatigue.
__label__MCCOY Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there? 
__label__MCCOY I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same thing. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, have you and Jim gone out of your minds? Why, this is a jailbreak! 
__label__MCCOY I'm glad you got away, too. Why do you think they want to kill us? 
__label__MCCOY Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed out? 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay. McCoy. 
__label__MCCOY I'm delighted. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question, you don't need me to answer it for you. Why don't you ask James T.
__label__MCCOY I still think you're imagining things. 
__label__MCCOY Over here, Captain! 
__label__MCCOY The odds are not good. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe the planet smells a trick. 
__label__MCCOY I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of rapport she has with Kollos. 
__label__MCCOY Terraforming isn't new. It implies intelligent life forms. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, listen!
__label__MCCOY There has been no error. 
__label__MCCOY He's in fair shape. 
__label__MCCOY No. Say to yourself, The child is mine. It is mine. It is  (But she has made up her mind, and the child is coming anyway.)
__label__MCCOY All the ganglia, the nerves. There are a million of them. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, sir.
__label__MCCOY Of course. Come with me. 
__label__MCCOY This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly? 
__label__MCCOY The man is dead. 
__label__MCCOY Ambassador. 
__label__MCCOY What kind of talk is that? 
__label__MCCOY I'm worried about her, Jim. She's not at the quarters, she's not at the diggings. She could be in trouble. Nancy! 
__label__MCCOY Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much. 
__label__MCCOY That's what the computers will tell us. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean, what sort of work? I'm a doctor. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Bridge. 
__label__MCCOY Your orders, Jim. You're the last one. 
__label__MCCOY I'll explain later. 
__label__MCCOY Well, thank you. Mind if I look around a bit? (checking the bottles) Crude, but very useable. 
__label__MCCOY How can a planet full of people just disappear? 
__label__MCCOY The best I can do is get all the readings I can get and analyse them later. 
__label__MCCOY Now just a minute. All I did was ask her to dance. She didn't have to say yes. 
__label__MCCOY Not a thing, Jim. (the woman's mouth is moving) The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain? 
__label__MCCOY But, Captain  KIRK: You have your orders. 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back. 
__label__MCCOY It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the grass, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY She would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know. I respect her privacy. 
__label__MCCOY Results also negative. 
__label__MCCOY What's on, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY What is this? Everything's all messed up and changed around, out of place. 
__label__MCCOY No, thank you. 
__label__MCCOY This is no joke, Jim. I know what I saw. 
__label__MCCOY Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it work. And he did. But according to Spock, it works illogically. 
__label__MCCOY These look real. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a grey hair on her head. 
__label__MCCOY That is my intention, Doctor. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not talking about rationality. 
__label__MCCOY My work, Jim. This is prescription stuff. Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman. 
__label__MCCOY Ask Landru. He remembers. He knows and he watches. You are strange. Are you not of the Body? 
__label__MCCOY Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that. 
__label__MCCOY Well, that's better than 'Hey, you.'  KIRK: I want to know why we're here. I want to know what's going on.
__label__MCCOY There wouldn't have been enough primitives left to bury their dead. 
__label__MCCOY Lovely. They just don't make them like that anymore. 
__label__MCCOY Trouble. Your friend here didn't want a checkup. Turns out there's a reason. 
__label__MCCOY Captain! (Kirk wakes) Jim, what is it? What have they done to you? 
__label__MCCOY What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them. 
__label__MCCOY Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? 
__label__MCCOY I thought you might like to know that Lieutenant Uhura is back to college level. She'll be back on the job within a week. 
__label__MCCOY Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind of function  KIRK: Doctor. Why do you call me the creator? 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four. 
__label__MCCOY Not good. If I could only operate. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY Sulu! 
__label__MCCOY What proof do we need? We know what a Klingon is. 
__label__MCCOY To James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY That pig-headed Vulcan stamina. I couldn't have pulled them through without it. 
__label__MCCOY You're taking an awful chance, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, but it  KIRK: Will it hurt him if you do so? 
__label__MCCOY There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there? 
__label__MCCOY Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY Most of the animals would just lay there. Jim, the Capellan power-cat! 
__label__MCCOY That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines.
__label__MCCOY Easy, Bailey.
__label__MCCOY I have to have a close look at him. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, that's ridiculous, Spock. How are we going to learn anything by staying here? 
__label__MCCOY I do. 
__label__MCCOY Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive. 
__label__MCCOY And we've had too much of yours. I'll never get me to stay here.
__label__MCCOY Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please. It is enough that it works. 
__label__MCCOY Joy to you all, friends. 
__label__MCCOY I didn't say that. 
__label__MCCOY What? 
__label__MCCOY You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. She's making a gesture in return. 
__label__MCCOY No, no particular person, just people in general. Where did they go? 
__label__MCCOY Tell Spock it's time for another shot. 
__label__MCCOY Well that doesn't make sense. It's his duty to see no one gets hurt. If something's wrong down there, he should be there. 
__label__MCCOY There's nothing I can do, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first officer in the fleet. 
__label__MCCOY It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable. 
__label__MCCOY Well let's get there. 
__label__MCCOY Keep behind us, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Did you say I'm a man of curious habits? Jim's talking to a table. 
__label__MCCOY Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet. 
__label__MCCOY No, Spock. It's illegal, that's what it is. Besides, I must stand trial. I have to find out. 
__label__MCCOY Naturally. You could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mister Spock. But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork. 
__label__MCCOY Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he respects, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That's a pretty far out story. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sure everything's going to be all right. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, the man on top walks a lonely street. The chain of command is often a noose. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, are you sure you're all right? 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps, he'd still tend to protect that child. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Jim. I was wrong. (leaves) 
__label__MCCOY You were a little hard on the boy, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe they're still alive. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have no appetite for green blood. 
__label__MCCOY I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it.
__label__MCCOY All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles, whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who won't talk about his background. 
__label__MCCOY Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will. 
__label__MCCOY He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong. If I give him another shot  KIRK: Bones, give him another shot! 
__label__MCCOY More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably. 
__label__MCCOY Of course not. Anyway, it's just a fraction off normal. It's probably the instrument. They need to be recalibrated every so often. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you don't mean you're going to abandon the mapping mission to check out some meaningless signal? 
__label__MCCOY They must be furious to follow us this deep into Federation territory. 
__label__MCCOY It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it was all human. 
__label__MCCOY No, Jim. It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Kirk. 
__label__MCCOY Yeah, out already. 
__label__MCCOY That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard. An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and  MULHALL: I'm afraid that I must agree with Doctor McCoy. You could be suffering from a form of false euphoria. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what are you doing here? 
__label__MCCOY I didn't do it! Spock, the disease, what is it? What's the antidote? 
__label__MCCOY Thank you. 
__label__MCCOY (reading) A survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases? I thought you took Garrovick some food. What were you doing with this? 
__label__MCCOY Thank God. 
__label__MCCOY I don't dare. 
__label__MCCOY Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura. 
__label__MCCOY Compton! 
__label__MCCOY Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point. 
__label__MCCOY He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot. 
__label__MCCOY The whole episode was pretty hazy, Jim. I never really knew what happened. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I must admit the sensor readings seem too good. Human readings, yes, but not a single physical flaw. Totally perfect body. 
__label__MCCOY That's impossible. 
__label__MCCOY What is it? 
__label__MCCOY Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion. And according to him, it doesn't wear off. 
__label__MCCOY Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one day. The effects are like bubonic plague. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY We couldn't use it. We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there  KIRK: That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power. 
__label__MCCOY Come in. 
__label__MCCOY Can he do it?
__label__MCCOY Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know.
__label__MCCOY Oh, I'm assigning your technical aide, Captain. One of our psychiatrists does have a background in rehabilitative therapy.
__label__MCCOY A zoo? I'm no animal. 
__label__MCCOY She could kill us all in this state. 
__label__MCCOY The molecular structure of the brain tissues in the central nervous system are distorting. 
__label__MCCOY Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities.
__label__MCCOY Sonic separator. 
__label__MCCOY Foolie? 
__label__MCCOY But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak. What do the sensors read? 
__label__MCCOY Well, can we send the phasers down? 
__label__MCCOY Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can't possibly be the real article. 
__label__MCCOY No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation. 
__label__MCCOY What was the state of the Iotian culture before the Horizon came? 
__label__MCCOY She likes you, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY What would account for that, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen. 
__label__MCCOY Well, we'd better get to the control room. 
__label__MCCOY Plum. 
__label__MCCOY Scotty, give me a hand. (They prop Hengist up on a chair, leaning against the table.) 
__label__MCCOY I can't say much till I check our these readings. He looks human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing. 
__label__MCCOY The delta rays?
__label__MCCOY Let me take this, Jim. What Maab has said is true. Our customs are different. What the Klingon has said is unimportant, and we do not hear his words. I just called the Klingon a liar. 
__label__MCCOY In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky. 
__label__MCCOY I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't. 
__label__MCCOY Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately.
__label__MCCOY Me? What are you talking about? 
__label__MCCOY The crew is fit. I found nothing unusual, with one exception. 
__label__MCCOY Well, if he asked you to forget him, I think you should try to do just that. Do you think he'd want to deceive you? 
__label__MCCOY They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them down on us. 
__label__MCCOY No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance to scan the tapes. There are eight or ten hours of record tape there. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Heartbeat now thirty, dropping fast. It's a heart flutter. He's dying. 
__label__MCCOY (pointing at T'Pau's bodyguard) With him? 
__label__MCCOY I wonder where she is. 
__label__MCCOY What the devil is Spock doing? What's delaying him? 
__label__MCCOY Help that? 
__label__MCCOY I can't. I  KIRK: Bones? Bones? 
__label__MCCOY (standing) Spock? Where are we? 
__label__MCCOY Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance. 
__label__MCCOY Lord, forgive me. (He fires again and she dies) 
__label__MCCOY With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna? 
__label__MCCOY Chekov may be right. The Klingons claim to have honoured the truce, but there have been incidents, raids on our outposts. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, the door. 
__label__MCCOY You're discussing tactics. Do you realise what this really comes down to? Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel does. 
__label__MCCOY It's been nearly an hour. Can people live that long as disassembled atoms in a transporter beam? 
__label__MCCOY You want to bet? 
__label__MCCOY You are a disembodied brain. 
__label__MCCOY Sandoval's medical record, four years ago when the expedition left Earth. He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. No major operations, but there was an appendectomy. Received all required inoculations, et cetera. 
__label__MCCOY That means only organic matter is affected. But how? 
__label__MCCOY And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes? 
__label__MCCOY Oh. 
__label__MCCOY No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer. And it better be the next one. 
__label__MCCOY Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance? 
__label__MCCOY Well, if we came upon an alien creature we'd never seen before, the first thing we'd do is to make sure it was free of harmful bacteria. Then we'd see if it was intelligent. 
__label__MCCOY It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery. I really thought she'd learned to want it. 
__label__MCCOY A teddy bear? 
__label__MCCOY He's dead, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY What is this, Spock? Captain, are you all right? (flash, flash) I see that you're still signaling SPOCK: Doctor, one moment, please.
__label__MCCOY Jim? Aurora? What   [Bridge] 
__label__MCCOY What in the name of? What is Spock doing? 
__label__MCCOY That is essentially it. 
__label__MCCOY Abnormal, of course, but it's not schizophrenia, tissue damage, or any condition I'm acquainted with, Jim. And you know after getting him here, it took almost a triple dose of sedative to put him under.
__label__MCCOY Odd that these people should worship the sun. 
__label__MCCOY What? 
__label__MCCOY Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you. Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die. 
__label__MCCOY That may not be easy, Jim. Medical analysis indicates the Troglytes are mentally inferior. 
__label__MCCOY You said they were imitative, and the book  OXMYX: I don't want any more cracks about the Book. 
__label__MCCOY The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's the way Daystrom put it. 
__label__MCCOY You could have seen the rabbit.
__label__MCCOY There, that should do it. Just let him rest now. (to Tomar) You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of hours. 
__label__MCCOY Well? 
__label__MCCOY They've got the co-ordinates, Jim. It's locked in. 
__label__MCCOY This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil. 
__label__MCCOY Which adds up to absolutely nothing. 
__label__MCCOY Riley? Captain Kirk, McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY All right. Try to relax. Jim, it's started, the fever. It's over a hundred, and it's climbing. 
__label__MCCOY Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us. 
__label__MCCOY It was infused into your bodies at key structural points. It had to be done by injection. 
__label__MCCOY Come back here, you fool! 
__label__MCCOY Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Any more good ideas, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY You can't leave her! 
__label__MCCOY I've heard of it. 
__label__MCCOY Where'd they go? 
__label__MCCOY A seizure of some type. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little  KIRK: They've reduced the whole crew! (thumps table in anger) 
__label__MCCOY Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. Spock. What in the name of sanity is going on? 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature. It wasn't necessary. I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it. 
__label__MCCOY It's a starship like nothing I've ever seen. The size of it. 
__label__MCCOY Come on, Jim. Let's go. 
__label__MCCOY I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless, mentally and physically. No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined.
__label__MCCOY Compliments of the house. To your good health and the health of the crew. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, I thought sure you'd know Thelin by now, Jim. He's been your first officer for five years. 
__label__MCCOY They spoke the truth. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, it's possible. 
__label__MCCOY Never mind counting them. 
__label__MCCOY I am. What's the problem? 
__label__MCCOY Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain? 
__label__MCCOY You can't be serious. That thing is virtually made out of stone!
__label__MCCOY It looks like some kind of zoo. I don't recognise a lot of these species, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY What are you going to do, Mister Spock?
__label__MCCOY Did he report anything wrong? 
__label__MCCOY Chekov, give me a hand. 
__label__MCCOY Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound. 
__label__MCCOY You'll destroy him. 
__label__MCCOY There's something under the skin. (a red light goes out) He's dead. 
__label__MCCOY 'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY But if you're not, what are you? 
__label__MCCOY Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive. If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say nervous. And for another thing, he's avoiding food. I checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days. 
__label__MCCOY There's no hurry, Mister Spock. The antidote probably doesn't concern you. Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time. 
__label__MCCOY No, Jim. No indication of any kind. 
__label__MCCOY Sybo said it feeds on death. 
__label__MCCOY Quite simple. Happens every day. 
__label__MCCOY Well, we're doing everything that's possible.
__label__MCCOY War is never imperative, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY That's an answer.  
__label__MCCOY If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in  KIRK: That's no miscalculation. 
__label__MCCOY He's hardly breathing. Help me get him to Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY How close are you going to it? 
__label__MCCOY Could it be the Enterprise hit the planet? 
__label__MCCOY Well, let's not stand here. Let's do something. 
__label__MCCOY Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements. The right boot's too tight. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY That sounds like you're telling us to blow up the ship. 
__label__MCCOY I know something about it. 
__label__MCCOY Oh? This could be an historic occasion. 
__label__MCCOY You poor girl. 
__label__MCCOY Love to teach it to you.
__label__MCCOY I did. 
__label__MCCOY Where's Kirk? 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. 
__label__MCCOY And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That's what I've recorded, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place. 
__label__MCCOY Now certainly you understand our feelings about that. 
__label__MCCOY But the question is, what's the dosage? 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. Five or six hours. I gave them a pretty big shot, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator! Spock, give me a hand! 
__label__MCCOY Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY I'm especially worried about Bailey. Navigator's position's rough enough for a seasoned man.
__label__MCCOY What happened, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one. 
__label__MCCOY But I've got one. Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim. In this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million Earth-type planets. And in all of the universe, three million million galaxies like this. And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of each of us. Don't destroy the one named Kirk. 
__label__MCCOY As planned, the construction of android robots is underway. All is proceeding as expected and as promised. I can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding.
__label__MCCOY You mean it's some kind of a zoo? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Yes, in a way it is. The human brain controls the individual's functions. 
__label__MCCOY Before you condemn it, why not try it? 
__label__MCCOY I tell you, we should have heard something by now. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine check-up, your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said, you will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck. 
__label__MCCOY And communications and fire control. 
__label__MCCOY I'll be right there. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to call her Gem. 
__label__MCCOY Let's prepare to close. Nurse! 
__label__MCCOY But you didn't know that it would work. 
__label__MCCOY What was it?
__label__MCCOY I thought you'd be pleased to hear that. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato. 
__label__MCCOY What happened to them? 
__label__MCCOY Nurse? Doctor Wallace! 
__label__MCCOY But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I can't give you any specific circumstance that will explain him. 
__label__MCCOY You look tired, Miss Chapel. Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections. 
__label__MCCOY I never say that.
__label__MCCOY I wonder what makes it do that.
__label__MCCOY I don't know, Jim. Maybe I'm imagining things, and maybe I'm not. You tell me. 
__label__MCCOY Many ways? What else does she know about us? 
__label__MCCOY Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned. 
__label__MCCOY The oracle can no longer punish us. 
__label__MCCOY There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not the question. If something unusual is going on down there KIRK: An assumption, Doctor.
__label__MCCOY Look around you, Spock. Everything is working. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Spock. And hatred. 
__label__MCCOY It does, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY She couldn't, Jim. Her mind is functioning on a very simple level. Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use. 
__label__MCCOY Call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority.
__label__MCCOY Something's wrong. 
__label__MCCOY Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero. 
__label__MCCOY Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy you're still alive. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, up ahead. (a light at the end of the tunnel) 
__label__MCCOY This is McCoy, Jim. I think you'd better get back here. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, I don't see how that can be. 
__label__MCCOY Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one. 
__label__MCCOY Then try that, Doctor Wallace. Try anything, but do it quickly. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, that green blood of yours may have saved you before, but this time it almost did you in. You can't deny it. 
__label__MCCOY Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears. As long as it worked, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY What is that supposed to mean? 
__label__MCCOY Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three.
__label__MCCOY Well now that you know it, you might as well assist me. Hand me the physiostimulator. 
__label__MCCOY It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement. 
__label__MCCOY That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries.
__label__MCCOY Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running around. He should be in bed. 
__label__MCCOY Spock? 
__label__MCCOY It couldn't be Keniclius. He'd be over two hundred and fifty years old. 
__label__MCCOY How well we both know that. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I've found that evil usually triumphs unless good is very, very careful. 
__label__MCCOY I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem. 
__label__MCCOY I wonder what happened to her, that she should be so terrified of us. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, but she said more than that. Not just death, but fear. She said it also feeds on fear. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end. It could go on for year after year, massacre after massacre. 
__label__MCCOY There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick. A normal wound would heal quickly. 
__label__MCCOY It's theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period. 
__label__MCCOY Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests.
__label__MCCOY Can I help you? 
__label__MCCOY I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind. A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together. 
__label__MCCOY Commodore? Commodore Decker? (he injects him) 
__label__MCCOY Now look, Spock, Jim Kirk could be in real trouble. Will it work or not?
__label__MCCOY Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch. 
__label__MCCOY Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time. 
__label__MCCOY Only one half intact. 
__label__MCCOY Coranalin. 
__label__MCCOY Nothing lethal about light. 
__label__MCCOY Another coincidence, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY What's going on, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY It's hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.
__label__MCCOY And if that's not it? 
__label__MCCOY No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic. 
__label__MCCOY We're trying to help you, Oxmyx. 
__label__MCCOY Ma'am, I don't understand. Are you trying to say that she rejected him? That she doesn't want him? 
__label__MCCOY Let me guess. Klingons? Baris? 
__label__MCCOY I'll need help getting her in there. 
__label__MCCOY What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into some kind of poetry. 
__label__MCCOY Nothing. They said they were being attacked by an unidentified ship. 
__label__MCCOY Well, better get into some dry clothes. I wouldn't want you to catch cold. Your turn, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the universe. 
__label__MCCOY He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try. 
__label__MCCOY Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago. You know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Just like everyone else I've examined here. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, Jim! 
__label__MCCOY You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, Spock's almost gone. 
__label__MCCOY Medical report. (hands it over) She'll receive the best of care, Jim. She remembers nothing. She even thinks her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds.
__label__MCCOY What form of radiation was it? 
__label__MCCOY A matter of hours, that's all. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, I  KIRK: No, I don't really expect an answer. 
__label__MCCOY I see. And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course. 
__label__MCCOY Well, yes, I suppose it could happen. 
__label__MCCOY Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie. 
__label__MCCOY What's their impression of us? 
__label__MCCOY What is it? 
__label__MCCOY His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya. 
__label__MCCOY What happened, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, James? 
__label__MCCOY Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories about a people we've never even met face to face? 
__label__MCCOY You mean you're giving up? 
__label__MCCOY Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured. Now, let me see that arm. 
__label__MCCOY We have no choice. 
__label__MCCOY Physically human but not human. These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android. 
__label__MCCOY It should. 
__label__MCCOY And Crewman Darnell. 
__label__MCCOY But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain. 
__label__MCCOY Now, where I come from, that's what we call a lady. 
__label__MCCOY Just one. 
__label__MCCOY I think I know how he felt, Jim. There's a line from Shakespeare. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I can't understand it, Jim. Everything looked exactly the same as before, even Alice and the White Rabbit. Then an army of playing cards came out of nowhere, only they weren't playing. I was lucky to escape with my life. 
__label__MCCOY I hate to be a pessimist, but that may not be as easy as you think. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture past glory. 
__label__MCCOY Jim KIRK: They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds.
__label__MCCOY What orders are you referring to, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY The tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying. They behave as though nothing had gone wrong. They check out sound physically. There are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state. I have no answers, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY You have to. It's urgent. 
__label__MCCOY Could you turn up the heat? 
__label__MCCOY Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants? 
__label__MCCOY So do the bars of a jail, unless you're on the inside. 
__label__MCCOY Speech centre. 
__label__MCCOY Let it be done. 
__label__MCCOY What did you hope to gain by that, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY We appeal to you in the name of civilisation. Put a stop to this.
__label__MCCOY Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! (Nancy sends Spock flying with one slap) 
__label__MCCOY But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin. 
__label__MCCOY You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far from all right. 
__label__MCCOY Why not? 
__label__MCCOY (as the party is wheeled away) Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY I can't let him die, Jim. You get on to the transporter room.
__label__MCCOY Jim, I just took a tricording sweep, and I got the same readings almost as Spock got when we were pulled off course. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I can't give you one, Jim. I've never worked on anyone like him or anything like him. 
__label__MCCOY I understand. (Spock puts his hands on Gelder's face) Good, the reading's levelling.
__label__MCCOY No. No, if I'd be useful, as long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is. 
__label__MCCOY DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found. Did Spock call in at all? 
__label__MCCOY We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a machine. When it comes to your job, that's different. And it always will be different. 
__label__MCCOY Men weren't intended to live this far underground. It's just not natural. 
__label__MCCOY Take it easy. 
__label__MCCOY The sensors don't indicate any life forms down there, aside from fish. 
__label__MCCOY He means when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I was looking over some material about their Ice Age. 
__label__MCCOY I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his. 
__label__MCCOY We've explained the Berthold rays to you and their effect. Can't you understand? 
__label__MCCOY That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too. 
__label__MCCOY Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer. 
__label__MCCOY The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't. 
__label__MCCOY There's some resemblance. I don't know how much we can depend on it. But I'll tell you one thing. We have to get out of this area. Those mists out there are acting something like a macromorphase enzyme. If the shields don't stay up, the hull will be corroded and we'll all be broken down into nice digestible particles. 
__label__MCCOY Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave.
__label__MCCOY According to findings, it should. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with. 
__label__MCCOY Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud? 
__label__MCCOY Mister Fox, they faked a message from the Captain, they've launched an attack against our ship. Now you want us to trust them openly? 
__label__MCCOY These roots and soil cultures can be a medical treasure house. Any problems there? 
__label__MCCOY You mean you want us to co-operate with those  KIRK: If we want to get out of here, it's our only choice. 
__label__MCCOY But, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY How much time do they have? 
__label__MCCOY And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she thinks he's the right man. On the other hand, she's a woman. All woman.
__label__MCCOY But they'll be looking for us. 
__label__MCCOY And best of all, no practical jokes. 
__label__MCCOY You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here. How'd you know we'd come? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's your big chance. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY Have you seen any strangers among the villagers? 
__label__MCCOY We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY He's his smiling self again. I've discharged him from Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY If they weren't there it's ridiculous to think they could still be alive. Not after all this time. 
__label__MCCOY  Lucky we found that log. If we'd gone back to the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY All I can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions become, and I have no idea why. I'm all right. It's those stimulants.
__label__MCCOY I'm not asking you to make the decision for me. 
__label__MCCOY No, no. We're working hard. We'll find an antidote. 
__label__MCCOY Nope. 
__label__MCCOY You think we're being invited in? 
__label__MCCOY I don't know about that. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be no error. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you're due in surgery. I'm going to bob your ears. 
__label__MCCOY You mean you're going to scan space for him? 
__label__MCCOY I don't either.
__label__MCCOY The disease, Captain, the one they created three hundred years ago. 
__label__MCCOY Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. I'm ready for the vote. 
__label__MCCOY My tricorder doesn't register it. 
__label__MCCOY This whole thing is a new experience for all of us. 
__label__MCCOY Even the ship's chronometers have stopped. 
__label__MCCOY I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here. 
__label__MCCOY No. I just removed these for examination. His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system. 
__label__MCCOY You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking for you for four hours. 
__label__MCCOY I won't allow it. 
__label__MCCOY It was quite a hike here. You're tired. Just take it easy for a while. 
__label__MCCOY I don't like the sound of him, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, you don't have to worry. I know how to handle this. I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too. 
__label__MCCOY What'd you say to her? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours, minutes? How much longer do you want to wait? 
__label__MCCOY In his present condition, I don't think it would make much difference. 
__label__MCCOY What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim. Take this ship out of here. 
__label__MCCOY Except the red rings on his face. 
__label__MCCOY They're going to release us. 
__label__MCCOY Answers it very well. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I don't believe it. There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out. 
__label__MCCOY I keep wondering who might be after us in a shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be right, can l, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't believe in you, either. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, sir.
__label__MCCOY Thank you. 
__label__MCCOY We don't know that. 
__label__MCCOY How do you mean? 
__label__MCCOY Nothing has been proven yet, Spock. The DNA code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing. You'll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder. 
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant Uhura, I have to hand it to you. This is just what the doctor would have ordered. 
__label__MCCOY It's just a joke, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY No, it's more than that. 
__label__MCCOY (in a monotone) You offer us only well-being. 
__label__MCCOY They'll never do it, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Dead. 
__label__MCCOY You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could have destroyed it. 
__label__MCCOY I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is Daystrom? 
__label__MCCOY I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for an examination. 
__label__MCCOY In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century ago. 
__label__MCCOY Of course, there's another possibility. 
__label__MCCOY He has one year to live. 
__label__MCCOY Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and  FLINT: And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected. 
__label__MCCOY My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do. Come on, Spock. Yield to the logic of the situation. 
__label__MCCOY There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down. . 
__label__MCCOY Let's get back to this solid rock business. Just how much rock are we going to go through? 
__label__MCCOY Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get cracking. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, not now. 
__label__MCCOY Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged up? 
__label__MCCOY We're now of one mind. 
__label__MCCOY How long have we got now, Scotty? 
__label__MCCOY There's nothing I can do, Jim. If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon. 
__label__MCCOY Radiation? That's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier? 
__label__MCCOY I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now whatever it is that's out there  SPOCK: It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor. 
__label__MCCOY Locate the portal. It can't be too far.
__label__MCCOY All perfectly normal. Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else. 
__label__MCCOY Minor? Our science doesn't have anything that works that fast.
__label__MCCOY There are none after it's refined. But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it releases a violent reaction. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. Go right ahead. 
__label__MCCOY Just a few seconds more.
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY What the devil? 
__label__MCCOY Well, somebody sent a distress call. 
__label__MCCOY Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour.
__label__MCCOY Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier.
__label__MCCOY If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two. 
__label__MCCOY However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical. 
__label__MCCOY I wonder what killed him. 
__label__MCCOY What's your problem, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this? 
__label__MCCOY Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I remember you. 
__label__MCCOY Your men are tired.
__label__MCCOY Poison. The fruit is deadly. 
__label__MCCOY I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state that I warned you about Bailey's condition. Now that's no bluff.
__label__MCCOY I guarantee it. Now, go on, please. 
__label__MCCOY Leave me here, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY No more magic for us, Jim. It's all back there. You think Lucien really was the demon some men call Lucifer? 
__label__MCCOY You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet. Fifty eight days. 
__label__MCCOY Did she cry, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY You can't do it, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY The release of emotions, Mister Spock, is what keeps us healthy.
__label__MCCOY Well, now, I think I can fix that for you. Enterprise? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you ordered us? You had no authority! 
__label__MCCOY Our tissues definitely show a massive infection, Jim, but something is immunising us down here, thank heavens, or we'd have been dead hours ago. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Truce? Are you serious? I've got men in Sickbay, some of them dying. Atrocities committed on their persons, and you talk about making peace with these fiends? If our backs were turned, they'd jump us in a minute. And you know what Klingons do to prisoners. Slave labour, death planets, experiments! 
__label__MCCOY That's the Vulcan death grip for you. 
__label__MCCOY This is a barren world. Limited vegetation, no apparent animal life. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln? 
__label__MCCOY I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock. You are perfectly healthy, that is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of a hundred. 
__label__MCCOY What about you, Spock? What does your logic tell you? 
__label__MCCOY Suffering, in torment and pain. Labouring without end. 
__label__MCCOY Scotty! 
__label__MCCOY Jim! You touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you. They're offering you a chance for combat. They consider it more pleasurable than love. 
__label__MCCOY What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his body. You've killed a loyal officer, your best friend. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sure. 
__label__MCCOY That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.  KIRK: Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months. 
__label__MCCOY Tests? 
__label__MCCOY Oh, Miss. That coffee, it just smells wonderful. 
__label__MCCOY A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also trained to be a diplomat. Why not try a carrot instead of a stick? 
__label__MCCOY Then I won't leave you. 
__label__MCCOY Terminal. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. I'll get on it right away. Oh, and in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal ticking  SPOCK: Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere? 
__label__MCCOY Two small, one large. 
__label__MCCOY Why? 
__label__MCCOY The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege. 
__label__MCCOY I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power. 
__label__MCCOY Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if that's what you mean. 
__label__MCCOY Yeah. Hot as Vulcan. Now I understand what that phrase means. 
__label__MCCOY No wars until he was attacked. 
__label__MCCOY Are you aware of what's happening to his body? Heart action doubled, temperature a hundred and four degrees? 
__label__MCCOY Easy, easy. I'm here. Now you must want the child! 
__label__MCCOY We're coming! 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium? 
__label__MCCOY Oh, those orders. Well, there wasn't time. We never had a chance to listen to them. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back. You better find out how that thing works and soon. 
__label__MCCOY It isn't your fault. 
__label__MCCOY Come down tot the lab, Jim. I may have something for you now. 
__label__MCCOY I'll be right there. 
__label__MCCOY Do something. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I certainly don't want to keep you any longer from your fiancee. Show her in. 
__label__MCCOY Yes?
__label__MCCOY Three or four seconds. 
__label__MCCOY Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship. That's begging for trouble. 
__label__MCCOY Did you find Mister Sulu, Captain?
__label__MCCOY (with an extreme southern drawl) Ready to beam up. Hiya, Jimmy boy! Hey, I've taken care of everything. All y'all gotta do is relax.
__label__MCCOY Parmen has promised me you'll be safe. 
__label__MCCOY If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY Barely an instant in eternity, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I'll check her out. Maybe I can help. 
__label__MCCOY Back to that planet? Without warp speed, it'll take months, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home, Charlie with the power he has  KIRK: Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he wants. Nothing happens fast enough. 
__label__MCCOY You don't? A blind man could see it with a cane. You're not a pet. You're not a specimen kept in a cage. You're a lover. 
__label__MCCOY Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY What's going on here, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY It's been too long. Jim should have at least signaled by now. 
__label__MCCOY She appears to be perfectly healthy. As for the other, her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species, whatever that is. 
__label__MCCOY Move aside. (he tends to Chekov) 
__label__MCCOY Come on, Spock, now! 
__label__MCCOY Because there are no feelings to discuss. 
__label__MCCOY I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and neither are you. 
__label__MCCOY While it lasts. 
__label__MCCOY I was just trying to make conversation, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY The medical kit wouldn't be harmful. It would help her, one of their specimens. 
__label__MCCOY In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know. 
__label__MCCOY I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings, and he's not responding. Got to get him back to the ship, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do. 
__label__MCCOY He's got to get some rest, Jim. And would you get that muscleman out of my Sickbay. (gestures at the security guard) 
__label__MCCOY He'll be coming around soon, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Then we could be in the wrong.
__label__MCCOY You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to Sickbay? 
__label__MCCOY Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with the other casualties. Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma, shock. They're all healing at a fantastic rate. 
__label__MCCOY He would not make a false entry. 
__label__MCCOY Spock. Is it me, Jim? Am I so sentimental that I just have to keep believing that he's still alive in that mass of protoplasm? 
__label__MCCOY Why? What is it, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY They don't seem very interested in communicating with us. If they can communicate at all. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. But there's something so very disturbing about her. 
__label__MCCOY I'd like to see the medical records on the expedition. 
__label__MCCOY Good night, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you. 
__label__MCCOY According to the life monitors, we're dying.
__label__MCCOY The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're growing older by the minute. Much older. My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing. In fact, I don't have a clue. 
__label__MCCOY It's made from the venom of the Argo sur-snake. 
__label__MCCOY You Vulcans are the most impossible, unimaginative  KIRK: Bones, that's not helping the situation. 
__label__MCCOY Closed. 
__label__MCCOY Now wait a minute. I realise that you can do almost anything a sighted person can do, but you can't pilot a starship. 
__label__MCCOY All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.
__label__MCCOY Come on, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY I don't understand how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain. 
__label__MCCOY The ships look like they never got off the ground. Could be the disease Keniclius accidentally brought here swept the planet before they could do whatever they were going to do. 
__label__MCCOY Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you. 
__label__MCCOY Well, as you know, we both brought Lazarus in here and I treated a deep abrasion on his forehead, right? 
__label__MCCOY No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep! 
__label__MCCOY Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five. 
__label__MCCOY (waking up) Yes, Spock? What is it? 
__label__MCCOY Unusual eye arrangement. I might've known he'd turn up with something like that. 
__label__MCCOY Now, this is marvellous. the most horrible conglomeration of antique architecture I've ever seen. 
__label__MCCOY The last of the tyrants to be overthrown. 
__label__MCCOY We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done. 
__label__MCCOY Come on. It's time to be going. 
__label__MCCOY But you said that was impossible. 
__label__MCCOY You're probably right, Doctor. By the way, I don't like how you've been running this ship lately. 
__label__MCCOY No one can restore a brain. 
__label__MCCOY Contented? Cramped in these tiny cages? 
__label__MCCOY And it's nice to know the lady is as intelligent as she is beautiful. Much like the flower she carries. 
__label__MCCOY Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it would be about here. 
__label__MCCOY Do you mean the children may be involved? 
__label__MCCOY Now wait a minute. He lost his ship and his crew, and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people. 
__label__MCCOY All right, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month. For all the good it'll do. 
__label__MCCOY If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave. 
__label__MCCOY Of course somebody will fix it. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I've got one and I definitely don't like it. I'd guess they're doing exactly what we would do. 
__label__MCCOY An exact duplicate of the Enterprise? Is it in orbit, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Well, at least it's neat. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense. 
__label__MCCOY It's certain there'd be planetwide panic. 
__label__MCCOY Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it? 
__label__MCCOY The ship, our engines, our weapons. It's just inconceivable that we are immobilised.
__label__MCCOY Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library? 
__label__MCCOY Oh now, let me guess. It's you and Carter Winston. He told me a little about it when I examined him. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like  KIRK: No, he's right. Continue. 
__label__MCCOY Ship's life support systems fading. Jim, we need oxygen. 
__label__MCCOY Don't be a fool, Mister Spock. We couldn't leave you out there. 
__label__MCCOY That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent. 
__label__MCCOY It's a line from a poem. A very old poem, isn't it? 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally, with anger? 
__label__MCCOY Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report?
__label__MCCOY Well, there goes paradise. 
__label__MCCOY I thought you were reporting to Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY To be so obsessed. 
__label__MCCOY Yeah. 
__label__MCCOY It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him? 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears. It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote.
__label__MCCOY You're not a native of Argelius, sir? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I had to see it to believe it. 
__label__MCCOY It's all right. You're on board the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY When I've finished logging it. 
__label__MCCOY No, no. No, I never eat until the crew eats.
__label__MCCOY That man's dead back there. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, do something! 
__label__MCCOY One, just once, I'd like to be able to land someplace and say, Behold, I am the Archangel Gabriel. 
__label__MCCOY No! 
__label__MCCOY You're creating fantasies, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY How long have they been down there now? 
__label__MCCOY Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly. 
__label__MCCOY Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, we don't have a lot of time. Spock  ORION [on viewscreen]: Fifteen minutes or not at all, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY The ship's Chief Medical Officer. 
__label__MCCOY What for? 
__label__MCCOY Where are they? 
__label__MCCOY I think she's in good shape. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY That one's done. Tested out normal. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know, Jim. This is a big ship. I'm just a country doctor. 
__label__MCCOY Jim  KIRK: Bones, that's enough! 
__label__MCCOY Then come. 
__label__MCCOY I don't read you at all, Jim.
__label__MCCOY You won't persuade me. 
__label__MCCOY I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin! 
__label__MCCOY A chance. At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a minute.
__label__MCCOY Ready to beam up, Captain. I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness. 
__label__MCCOY I'll have her talking in a minute. 
__label__MCCOY They've tried questioning him. He's almost agitated himself into a coma.
__label__MCCOY They're fine, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY My tricorder doesn't register it. 
__label__MCCOY It tastes like an ancient herb derivative. 
__label__MCCOY Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the tribbles who are breeding. If we don't get them off this ship, we're going to be hip deep in them. 
__label__MCCOY It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete. 
__label__MCCOY Nancy, it's Leonard! 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean? 
__label__MCCOY Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know. 
__label__MCCOY Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? 
__label__MCCOY No, there isn't. 
__label__MCCOY Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary specimen. Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I had your readings, I'd be the most incredible physical specimen of all time. 
__label__MCCOY And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now.
__label__MCCOY Get to the point, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Look at those pine trees. 
__label__MCCOY Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most. 
__label__MCCOY They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're sitting here playing chess with the computer. 
__label__MCCOY Void, star desert. The word conjures up pictures of dunes, oases, mirages. 
__label__MCCOY Now more than ever, I wish to search through the universe to find a cure for myself and others like me. And I want you to be with me. 
__label__MCCOY It's that green blood of his. 
__label__MCCOY I'm a doctor, not a coal miner. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY You can't do this! On this ship my medical authority is final! 
__label__MCCOY No a right cross. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. 
__label__MCCOY At this point, my medical log remains open. 
__label__MCCOY One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, the receptacles. Spock's consciousness was in one of them. 
__label__MCCOY If you're asking my approval  MULHALL: I require only your silence. Only you and I will know that Doctor Mulhall has not returned to her body. Isn't that worth your captain's life? Doctor, we can take what we wish. Neither you, this ship, nor worlds have the power to stop us. 
__label__MCCOY It's the Bible. 
__label__MCCOY Do you think I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since  SPOCK: The Vulcans saw it first and died. 
__label__MCCOY In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us. 
__label__MCCOY Of course not. 
__label__MCCOY I don't understand it. She's not sick at all. 
__label__MCCOY Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. I'll call you soon as I know anything. Sickbay out. 
__label__MCCOY My report on Lieutenant Riley. 
__label__MCCOY What in the name of heaven is this? 
__label__MCCOY Risky, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock? You've got a a good bedside manner, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Now, isn't that a thought? Here we are, antibodies of our own galaxy, attacking an invading germ. It would be ironic indeed if that were our sole destiny, wouldn't it? 
__label__MCCOY It would. 
__label__MCCOY Then my equipment should be there. 
__label__MCCOY It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation. After all, Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, Spock's simply trying,  KIRK: I know what he's doing, and I don't like it. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have been thinking about my job. 
__label__MCCOY Life prolongation. Didn't have much luck, did they?
__label__MCCOY We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go. 
__label__MCCOY So improbable we almost didn't check it. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. I don't want to go, but I can't help myself. 
__label__MCCOY All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, for the worse.
__label__MCCOY Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life.
__label__MCCOY Oh, about another thirty minutes. I've come across some most interesting organic compounds. Hey, Starfleet was right. 
__label__MCCOY You all right, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY I wonder when his T'Pring arrives. 
__label__MCCOY On pure speculation, just an educated guess, I'd say that man is alive. 
__label__MCCOY No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take his little head like that. There, arm in a. That's it. See how easy?
__label__MCCOY What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet, Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous. 
__label__MCCOY Practically end of watch.
__label__MCCOY Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam without reason. 
__label__MCCOY I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I find out anything, I'll let you know. (leaves) 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY Where else would I be? 
__label__MCCOY Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the acetylcholine test. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, give him a minute. He's in a state of shock. 
__label__MCCOY As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not interested in any physical-psychological aspects, Jim boy. We all perfectly healthy down here. 
__label__MCCOY You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing? 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay. McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY But tell me, which do you prefer to have around? 
__label__MCCOY No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine. Lung efficiency is fifty percent better. 
__label__MCCOY He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Well, she's not just another girl, Captain. Don't make that mistake. 
__label__MCCOY It's been removed surgically. 
__label__MCCOY It won't die. By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, he's run off. 
__label__MCCOY I'd like to examine the body. 
__label__MCCOY Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it, but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command. Am I right? 
__label__MCCOY And peace and harmony. Are you of the Body? 
__label__MCCOY You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot  SPOCK: Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine. 
__label__MCCOY Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in on it. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I don't like this. 
__label__MCCOY You are very kind. 
__label__MCCOY My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor. 
__label__MCCOY Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim? 
__label__MCCOY That's Spock! 
__label__MCCOY It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen. Every nerve ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing torn, no bleeding. It's a medical miracle. 
__label__MCCOY But that was our only chance to stop them  KIRK: I didn't think it was. 
__label__MCCOY Take it easy, Mister Scott. I hate to think what that stuff's doing to your stomach lining. 
__label__MCCOY Not a very welcome sight, is it? 
__label__MCCOY She seems fine now. 
__label__MCCOY Well, drink it down, Spock. It's the human thing to do. That's a medical order, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. 
__label__MCCOY I'm perfectly aware of the dosage required. Now, you've got ten seconds before it takes effect. You'll be out less than five minutes. 
__label__MCCOY Just because the Vulcans failed  SPOCK: I am more capable. 
__label__MCCOY You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down. 
__label__MCCOY He's a Vulcan. You can't force emotion out of him. 
__label__MCCOY The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite clear on the subject. Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery. 
__label__MCCOY And truant officers, I presume. 
__label__MCCOY What has that got  AMANDA: You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to your father. 
__label__MCCOY Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and more. The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy. 
__label__MCCOY Inside solid rock? 
__label__MCCOY No. (she goes to Kirk again) No! (She transforms into her natural state. Kirk screams, McCoy fires the phaser, she changes back into Nancy) 
__label__MCCOY What is this place? 
__label__MCCOY Not so fast, Spock. Lie there quietly. 
__label__MCCOY What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY So is your father's life.
__label__MCCOY Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work. 
__label__MCCOY Indeed she is.  
__label__MCCOY Yes, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know yet, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Do you feel hot? 
__label__MCCOY I am defending myself! 
__label__MCCOY Jim, she may not remember or even really know. Disassociation could be complete. It doesn't seem possible she could have performed surgery on Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Miss Chapel. 
__label__MCCOY That's right. 
__label__MCCOY How do you feel? 
__label__MCCOY What's that? 
__label__MCCOY We're all dying.
__label__MCCOY You intend to stay here, on Yonada? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I'm picking up a humanoid reading of incredible strength.
__label__MCCOY Yes, I'd say that's rare. 
__label__MCCOY That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock. I can't imagine a mirage ever disturbing those mathematically perfect brain waves of yours. 
__label__MCCOY This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
__label__MCCOY She had bad internal injuries, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Go ahead, Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally normally except his memory. 
__label__MCCOY That's just the negative part, Mister Spock. I've been over those records. Now the women, they're supposed to be something very special. They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that drives men wild. 
__label__MCCOY You're forgetting one thing. The planet's sensors can undoubtedly detect the difference between real and feigned injuries. 
__label__MCCOY Compton! 
__label__MCCOY Now, wait a minute. Not our attempt, Mister Spock. A group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type. Devoted to logic, completely unemotional  KIRK: All right, all right, gentlemen. As you were. Rig for tractor beam, Helm. Lock onto that vessel. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, if we don't self-destruct now all those people will die. 
__label__MCCOY There is no medicine that can help him. He'll have to come through this himself. 
__label__MCCOY Plague? Why didn't you tell me? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels  [Bridge]
__label__MCCOY No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself. 
__label__MCCOY Well, we can't do much underwater exploration without the aqua-shuttle. Our equipment is too limited. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, a number of these were broken against the ship's air system grill. 
__label__MCCOY It tastes just fine. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now  SPOCK: Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age. Do you agree with it? 
__label__MCCOY Well, where do we start, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan. 
__label__MCCOY Tell me. The ship's supply of food concentrates couldn't have lasted fourteen years. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, if the others are lost, why take the risk? 
__label__MCCOY More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign. 
__label__MCCOY And I'm ready to get back to some of that monotonous, old, routine Sickbay work. 
__label__MCCOY Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their own words? 
__label__MCCOY We do. 
__label__MCCOY Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena. 
__label__MCCOY I thought you had the thing timed out. 
__label__MCCOY No. I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget. 
__label__MCCOY It's probably nothing important. 
__label__MCCOY How many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools? (leaves) 
__label__MCCOY Sure they are, now. But what about before? 
__label__MCCOY Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, there's no doubt about that. 
__label__MCCOY It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear. 
__label__MCCOY Scott and Sulu? 
__label__MCCOY Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant. 
__label__MCCOY Most seventeen year olds do. Come on, let's go. I'll show you to your quarters.
__label__MCCOY Because they were caused by the aurora. Spock, there was an aurora nineteen years ago. I remember  SPOCK [OC]: Which brought on the particular plague just as this aurora has brought it on. 
__label__MCCOY You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty.
__label__MCCOY I don't like it, Jim. A vessel this size cannot be run by one computer. 
__label__MCCOY Good heavens. This is a Capellan power-cat. No one's ever been able to keep one alive. 
__label__MCCOY You'd better come down to Sickbay  [Bridge]
__label__MCCOY Well, that's a beginning, but what about the captain? 
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not quite sure.
__label__MCCOY Or the equivalent weight in equipment. 
__label__MCCOY She's dead. Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's going to happen to us unless  KIRK: How long have we got, Bones? 
__label__MCCOY But it did happen, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY Why is this man dying? Hypo.
__label__MCCOY I can give him injections of a synthesised drug that would slow the disease. But after two days the body builds up an immunity. It loses its effectiveness. By the end of the third day, the disease will be irreversible. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to Bridge.
__label__MCCOY We found a cure. We're over that part of it. 
__label__MCCOY Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.
__label__MCCOY I don't think so. 
__label__MCCOY Oh? How so sure? Because you spotted something you liked in him, something familiar, like yourself say about, oh, eleven years ago?
__label__MCCOY Heart beat now fifty two and increasing. 
__label__MCCOY What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881. 
__label__MCCOY In the meantime, what about Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Well, don't worry about it. Perhaps a little hypersonic treatment might clear it up. 
__label__MCCOY He's reaching a level of consciousness. It's almost like he's in a light sleep. Now, that's as much as I dare do. 
__label__MCCOY I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw. 
__label__MCCOY I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there, and I want that life. 
__label__MCCOY You can turn command over to Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, this seems a lot more friendly than the desert. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. (they move off a little way) If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't. You know Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Yes, they are. 
__label__MCCOY Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic. You are blind, and there are some things you simply cannot do. 
__label__MCCOY Did you inject that beast or yourself? 
__label__MCCOY I like them better than I like you. 
__label__MCCOY There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and irritable. They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping. 
__label__MCCOY Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly.
__label__MCCOY Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests. 
__label__MCCOY Nothing wrong, Jim, but a face full of dust. But if I had a medical tricorder (opens eyes) Jim, look at yourself. 
__label__MCCOY On my way. McCoy out. 
__label__MCCOY Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I'm not the Kirk. Tell me what your function is. 
__label__MCCOY Ah, now that's more like it. Shall we? 
__label__MCCOY Why can't you just say, Mudd's probably there. 
__label__MCCOY And his tough Vulcan hide for another. 
__label__MCCOY Regarding our patients? 
__label__MCCOY What in blazes is that? 
__label__MCCOY Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here. 
__label__MCCOY It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit.
__label__MCCOY We can't keep referring to her as she, as if she weren't here. 
__label__MCCOY Tri-laser connector. Ready? 
__label__MCCOY I don't know. 
__label__MCCOY You're frightening her, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know.
__label__MCCOY Jim, you can't hand over the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans. 
__label__MCCOY As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks? 
__label__MCCOY I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate.
__label__MCCOY That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador.
__label__MCCOY The Captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour that order before you take over. 
__label__MCCOY It's no use, Jim. He'll be dead in a few minutes. His mind is gone. He no longer thinks. This machine has drained his mind somehow. 
__label__MCCOY Well then what's the use? We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive. We might not be able to save anything, including this ship! You haven't heard a word I've said. All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk. 
__label__MCCOY No! 
__label__MCCOY Well, shouldn't they be coming up? 
__label__MCCOY Captain, I understand your concern. Your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family. 
__label__MCCOY Well, it's worth a try. Why don't you try to get to Doctor Lester while I examine Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy. 
__label__MCCOY Where's our captain? Where's Jim Kirk? 
__label__MCCOY I can't get a correlation with any known poison. 
__label__MCCOY Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece, creatures like that would have been gods. 
__label__MCCOY Which happens to be my point. The thing won't die, even at temperatures and radiation which would burn Spock and your nephew to ashes. 
__label__MCCOY Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality factors, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Enterprise, McCoy. Emergency. Come in. Enterprise, come in.
__label__MCCOY That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm with you. 
__label__MCCOY The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm either unconscious or demented. This looks like old Earth around 1920 or 25. 
__label__MCCOY He's right, Jim. Being a doctor has its drawbacks. I always wondered why I (coughs, so they turn him on his side) Thanks. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, if they need it. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, for instance, above it's cold and harsh. And below, it's warm. The air is fresh. 
__label__MCCOY It's a bad wound. Punctured left lung. A centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart. 
__label__MCCOY Spock! What in the world? 
__label__MCCOY Just that. All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life form registering. No, now it's gone.  KIRK: As though a door opened and closed. 
__label__MCCOY Capellans aren't human, Jim. They're humanoid. There's certain internal differences. I don't have equipment to handle an emergency. 
__label__MCCOY My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my personal attention, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Is it, Mister Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay, and I'm staying. 
__label__MCCOY Good morning, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY You are all of those things and many more. They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them.
__label__MCCOY What is it, Spock? Are you in pain? 
__label__MCCOY We just want to talk to somebody about Spock's brain. That's all. 
__label__MCCOY What happened, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own. I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it. 
__label__MCCOY That ought to hold him for about six hours. 
__label__MCCOY They're quite large. Seven feet tall is not unusual. They're extremely fast and strong. Lieutenant? 
__label__MCCOY And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order, otherwise  SPOCK: Precisely, Doctor.
__label__MCCOY No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds, or more advanced civilisations. 
__label__MCCOY You're not of the Body! 
__label__MCCOY If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse, how are the last metabolic readings on our patients? 
__label__MCCOY I don't understand. This should have been attended to immediately. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, considerable psychological damage could have been caused. For example, his total resentment toward women. 
__label__MCCOY What the devil was that thing? 
__label__MCCOY The K3 indicator registers the level of pain. Watch as I turn it on. That's what he's been going through. I've never seen anything like it. No wonder the poor devils go mad. 
__label__MCCOY No change. 
__label__MCCOY Hurry up, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY In the name of heaven, where are we? 
__label__MCCOY Well, why are you just sitting there? 
__label__MCCOY Well, are you coming, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Don't you long to know its secrets? 
__label__MCCOY Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve. 
__label__MCCOY The blindness was temporary, Jim. There's something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's. 
__label__MCCOY Where are you, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Intelligent plants? 
__label__MCCOY Must have been some accident to get almost every pod. 
__label__MCCOY We'll be all right here now, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY This whole thing's incredible. A robot? A machine like that, who would build it? 
__label__MCCOY We're going to need help in all those areas. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you, nurse. Call security. I want to have some checks run on this man. 
__label__MCCOY Look out, Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my gratitude. Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you.
__label__MCCOY Help him. Don't be afraid to help him. 
__label__MCCOY My patients don't walk out in the middle of an operation. 
__label__MCCOY Now. 
__label__MCCOY What's she doing in there? 
__label__MCCOY You caught him. 
__label__MCCOY I have my orders. 
__label__MCCOY Examining you. 
__label__MCCOY Hey! Somebody! Anybody! 
__label__MCCOY Well, those firearms are not necessary. 
__label__MCCOY Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I don't know why I was worried. You can't kill a computer. 
__label__MCCOY And if the Klingons give their side even more? 
__label__MCCOY To be conquered by you. A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it? 
__label__MCCOY Want to think about it again, Jim? Starfleet's orders about this planet state no interference with  KIRK: No interference with normal social development. I'm not only aware of it, it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it. 
__label__MCCOY Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill you. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl too. 
__label__MCCOY It's possible. 
__label__MCCOY Perhaps not. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving. Goodbye. 
__label__MCCOY Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard. 
__label__MCCOY More and more fall injuries coming. Compound fracture. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock, that's your place. 
__label__MCCOY Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we should see him? 
__label__MCCOY Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them? 
__label__MCCOY Here. 
__label__MCCOY (trying his own communicator) No response. 
__label__MCCOY No. She said their laws and customs were not binding on you. 
__label__MCCOY Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you? 
__label__MCCOY Survival of the fittest, because their ancestors who survived had to have a superior resistance. Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars. Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, your descendants might develop a longer life, but I hardly think it's worth it. 
__label__MCCOY The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven.
__label__MCCOY The answer is no. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him. 
__label__MCCOY Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Care to debate that, Spock?
__label__MCCOY McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY You mean you're going to trust him? 
__label__MCCOY I won't harm a hair on its head, wherever that is. 
__label__MCCOY I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him.
__label__MCCOY Go ahead, but it looks clear enough. 
__label__MCCOY It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most promising substance tested so far. We're progressing.
__label__MCCOY Temperature, Captain. First sign. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe. 
__label__MCCOY Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence. 
__label__MCCOY It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him. 
__label__MCCOY I can't, but to question Spock of all people? Me, yes. I could run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock.
__label__MCCOY Shut up? I can save his life. 
__label__MCCOY Are you hill people? Do you know a hunter named Tyree? A mugato attacked him. He's James Kirk. He's a friend of Tyree's.
__label__MCCOY Now lower your arms and open your eyes. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn something up.
__label__MCCOY Mister Scott, will you report to Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer. What am I supposed to do? I can't remember. I don't remember. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Bridge. Captain there? 
__label__MCCOY A splendid custom if not carried to extremes. 
__label__MCCOY There's something I need to tell you. 
__label__MCCOY You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself. 
__label__MCCOY What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is required by the book. 
__label__MCCOY Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere. Not this time. 
__label__MCCOY And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt it down. 
__label__MCCOY How will you find Spock? 
__label__MCCOY These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go back to where you were. 
__label__MCCOY I cannot take credit for another man's work. Scotty did it. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. 
__label__MCCOY You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination. 
__label__MCCOY When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous. 
__label__MCCOY He's dead, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Here. Here. What's this? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.
__label__MCCOY It would be just enough time. 
__label__MCCOY Can a few more minutes matter, Spock? 
__label__MCCOY It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid. 
__label__MCCOY I swear that's honeysuckle I smell. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity. 
__label__MCCOY You mean we're trapped here? No communication, nothing? 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Me? I'm a doctor. If I were an officer of the line, I'd SCOTT: Would you have me open fire? 
__label__MCCOY You're going to have to kill him, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY What about a rendezvous? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. 
__label__MCCOY Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please? 
__label__MCCOY You mean they should have respected us? 
__label__MCCOY That's right. These immunising agents take time, and that's the real tragedy. Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died. 
__label__MCCOY Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty. 
__label__MCCOY What? 
__label__MCCOY A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't be for long. 
__label__MCCOY That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her along. 
__label__MCCOY From a machine? That I'd like to see. 
__label__MCCOY It's a diluted theragen derivative. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any.
__label__MCCOY That's exactly what I mean. 
__label__MCCOY I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can help. Fill me in.
__label__MCCOY He was worse than dead. 
__label__MCCOY Look at this stuff. 
__label__MCCOY That may be hours from now. He may be injured or dying. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, over there. 
__label__MCCOY Right. Just like the captain. 
__label__MCCOY It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex chain of molecules.
__label__MCCOY Now that we're here, what do we do? 
__label__MCCOY You need advice from me? You must be kidding. 
__label__MCCOY Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour  SPOCK: I have my own will, Captain. Let me help. 
__label__MCCOY Less than an hour, Jim. His body functions are slipping fast now. 
__label__MCCOY The totality of the universe? All knowledge? 
__label__MCCOY There would be no room for doubt. We would know. And after all, that's what we're after, isn't it, Prefect? To know? 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Yes? 
__label__MCCOY Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard? 
__label__MCCOY Please let them return to the ship. 
__label__MCCOY You take over my job and see what happens to you. 
__label__MCCOY Is it supposed to do that? 
__label__MCCOY I can't move, Jim. They're going to keep me here no matter what.
__label__MCCOY It's too risky, Jim. Argo's almost totally unexplored. You'd be out of contact range, unarmed. 
__label__MCCOY No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth. 
__label__MCCOY What are we going to do now, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY That's me. Didn't she mention I was here? 
__label__MCCOY He'll pull through. Jim, what about Spock? If we don't have that drug in twenty hours, he'll die. 
__label__MCCOY Over here. Over here.
__label__MCCOY Listen. Now, what do you think that  KIRK: Quiet. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY It'd take time. 
__label__MCCOY At least the captain and Spock are safe. 
__label__MCCOY Welcome home, Jim.
__label__MCCOY You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these. 
__label__MCCOY And if he's coming apart, Jim, we're in serious trouble. Getting out of here hinges on his computations. 
__label__MCCOY No, not now. 
__label__MCCOY But that's impossible. Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty years ago. 
__label__MCCOY Don't be afraid. 
__label__MCCOY Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart. 
__label__MCCOY Sakuro's disease is extremely rare. The chances of anyone contracting it are literally billions to one. 
__label__MCCOY He could have. 
__label__MCCOY Don't touch me. Stay away. Jim. Spock. Are you here? 
__label__MCCOY It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it.
__label__MCCOY Where's the captain, Spock? We were right behind him.
__label__MCCOY We're just going to jam it. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I  SPOCK: So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements. 
__label__MCCOY I am unconscious, or demented. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, listen, if you  KIRK: Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here. Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan.
__label__MCCOY That is an amoeba. 
__label__MCCOY In any case, Spock, you're the logical one to leave with the captain. 
__label__MCCOY And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too much from him.
__label__MCCOY Finished. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. A little later might be better. 
__label__MCCOY And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license.
__label__MCCOY I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me. 
__label__MCCOY Do I have a choice? 
__label__MCCOY And I refuse. 
__label__MCCOY What are you going to do with that six percent when they give it to you, Jim?
__label__MCCOY I'll let you know when I have the results. And from now on, it would be better if I handled the instruments without your help. 
__label__MCCOY Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What about some logic now? Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?
__label__MCCOY Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below? 
__label__MCCOY But that could take days. 
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning. 
__label__MCCOY I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying  KIRK: Bones! 
__label__MCCOY Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than that. 
__label__MCCOY Vulcan is not my idea of fun. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY Just a minute. You'd better make me a mechanic. Then I can treat little tin gods like you. (He punches Elias) Sorry, Sandoval. I don't know what made me do that. 
__label__MCCOY Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I. (Kirk leaves) What am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle conductor? If I jumped every time a light came on around here, I'd end up talking to myself.
__label__MCCOY It might work for you, Mister Spock, but it doesn't work for me.
__label__MCCOY Jim, I don't think anybody's in there. 
__label__MCCOY That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers. 
__label__MCCOY Yours. 
__label__MCCOY How do you feel, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years.
__label__MCCOY Captain, you're not beaming down. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's. Where are you going?
__label__MCCOY Well, he has a magnetism. Almost electric. You felt it. And it could over power McGivers with her preoccupation with the past. 
__label__MCCOY And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling you. 
__label__MCCOY Dress uniforms, spit and polish. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to stand this. I feel like my neck's in a sling. 
__label__MCCOY We're as happy about it as you are, Jim. I'd just like to make one request. 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to Captain Kirk. McCoy here. 
__label__MCCOY Physically. 
__label__MCCOY Gives me the creeps. I feel like something's watching us. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image. 
__label__MCCOY There is no positive evidence of any disorder. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I think we'd better tell Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, Spock may be dying. 
__label__MCCOY I know the place to get the proper drugs. I'll need a mortar and a pestle. 
__label__MCCOY Come on. 
__label__MCCOY A who movie? 
__label__MCCOY Increasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Kind of like the test you had to pass back at the Academy. 
__label__MCCOY You can't let him do this, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, that's correct. 
__label__MCCOY Oh yes. However, I'd assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it. How do you feel? 
__label__MCCOY Completed. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I mentioned that. 
__label__MCCOY Even Vulcans? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you. 
__label__MCCOY Spock! 
__label__MCCOY Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies? 
__label__MCCOY We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be done. 
__label__MCCOY I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log.
__label__MCCOY I'd say these people killed each other. 
__label__MCCOY Well, either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning, and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty. 
__label__MCCOY (scanning) This pig iron is almost carbon-free. That village furnace certainly didn't produce it. People's exhibit number two.
__label__MCCOY We're being drawn right into it. 
__label__MCCOY Who are you? 
__label__MCCOY If there were only some way we could contact him.
__label__MCCOY It was probably just one of the audio tapes rewinding. Come on, there's lots more to see. 
__label__MCCOY Good. McCoy out. 
__label__MCCOY I left orders that no one come in here. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here. These are humanoids, intelligent. They need to advance and grow. Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years. This isn't life. It's stagnation. 
__label__MCCOY Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain. Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in. 
__label__MCCOY There's that magic word again. Does your logic find this fascinating, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Even if you do, I can't restore it. I don't have the medical technique. 
__label__MCCOY I left my communicator. 
__label__MCCOY No, I believe it was celebium. However, Doctor Coleman disagrees. To be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite  COLEMAN: Doctor McCoy. 
__label__MCCOY Jim! 
__label__MCCOY One of my great great granddaddies, way back, had the finest garden in the South. Had to scramble around a little bit to find the materials, but I've got his recipe brewing now. 
__label__MCCOY Well, at least that gives our landing force a starting point. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left. 
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative! 
__label__MCCOY So that if anything went wrong, you would be the one to blame. 
__label__MCCOY These white crystals. That's what's left of the human body when you take the water away, which makes up ninety six percent of our bodies. Without water, we're all just three or four pounds of chemicals. Something crystallised them down to this. 
__label__MCCOY I saw that, but I don't believe it. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, Uhura, you're fine. 
__label__MCCOY Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft. Perhaps with a protective shield  KIRK: I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed. 
__label__MCCOY You what?
__label__MCCOY The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it? 
__label__MCCOY May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship? 
__label__MCCOY Sickbay to Bridge. 
__label__MCCOY Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life. 
__label__MCCOY Thank you. 
__label__MCCOY Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder. You want to make sure they all know about it! 
__label__MCCOY I beg you. 
__label__MCCOY I know, Christine. I know. Don't worry, we'll have the strobolin soon. 
__label__MCCOY Professor Crater! 
__label__MCCOY Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural circuits. 
__label__MCCOY Tetralubisol us a milky substance. Someone could have gotten careless, made a mistake. 
__label__MCCOY They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism. 
__label__MCCOY That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a completely hedonistic society. 
__label__MCCOY Do we trust him? 
__label__MCCOY You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results of specific tests. So far all we have to offer are our opinions. 
__label__MCCOY Nothing? 
__label__MCCOY We're stumped, Jim. The hormone seems to be the major factor in your mutation, but we just can't identify it. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse.  WALLACE: Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.
__label__MCCOY Medical log. Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be discharged, but the Captain's ordered him restricted to Sickbay to prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the Lieutenant's family. 
__label__MCCOY Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed. I am sorry. I liked that huge sun worshiper. 
__label__MCCOY Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take a minute. 
__label__MCCOY I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to live. 
__label__MCCOY Who's he, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not machines. 
__label__MCCOY Co-ordinates don't match. 
__label__MCCOY I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus Three.
__label__MCCOY Sometimes they do, if we're lucky. Monsters come in many forms.
__label__MCCOY It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy. 
__label__MCCOY How do you feel? 
__label__MCCOY You can't wait for the next one. We've had another case like Chekov. 
__label__MCCOY But you once had a body of some type? 
__label__MCCOY Looks like they're getting ready to go on a trip. 
__label__MCCOY Right. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally correlated: He's dying. You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality.
__label__MCCOY Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin. 
__label__MCCOY Do you feel all right, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him character. Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement.
__label__MCCOY Jim, you can't  KIRK: Bones, this mess is our responsibility. You have your orders.
__label__MCCOY Yes, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse! 
__label__MCCOY (to nurse) That'll be all. (she leaves) 
__label__MCCOY Where do you think you're going? 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY Salt tablets. 
__label__MCCOY Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too. 
__label__MCCOY I prescribed sleep. 
__label__MCCOY He's in a lot of pain. 
__label__MCCOY I can't identify it without a medi-comp. Without knowing, an antidote would be dangerous. 
__label__MCCOY No, Parmen! Stop it! 
__label__MCCOY Sounds like Don Juan.
__label__MCCOY I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines. 
__label__MCCOY I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply could not have done it. 
__label__MCCOY I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that. 
__label__MCCOY Shut up. (to Kirk) Shh. Shh! (to camera) Well, what do you know?
__label__MCCOY All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles. 
__label__MCCOY There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures. 
__label__MCCOY Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine. 
__label__MCCOY Well, that's that. 
__label__MCCOY Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off? 
__label__MCCOY I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room. 
__label__MCCOY Got to break through it somehow. 
__label__MCCOY He's dead, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Afraid I don't, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Tubular with extreme multiplicability.
__label__MCCOY Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay. 
__label__MCCOY Jim.. Spock. No pain. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, we managed. Mister Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers. 
__label__MCCOY And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this balance of power? 
__label__MCCOY Who knows? It might eventually cure the common cold, but lengthen lives? Poppycock. I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly. 
__label__MCCOY No. You know you'll get everything I can tell you. But when there is nothing, what should I say? 
__label__MCCOY Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance. 
__label__MCCOY In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate. Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency. 
__label__MCCOY You found no intelligent life forms, Mister Spock, but surely  SPOCK: The asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old, Doctor. Still no sign of life forms, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY So we're going down to recontaminate them. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here. The virus still exists. Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil. 
__label__MCCOY You mean yet. 
__label__MCCOY All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates you. 
__label__MCCOY What's the matter? 
__label__MCCOY All right. Let's, let's go. 
__label__MCCOY Watch out! 
__label__MCCOY Are you going to let him get away with that?
__label__MCCOY His neck was broken. By an expert. 
__label__MCCOY But I'd have to put a  KIRK: Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light. 
__label__MCCOY For which we are grateful, for we are men of peace ourselves. 
__label__MCCOY To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew. (hold up the jar) They're pieces of some form of living tissue. I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body. They're both the same. The boy's too weak to touch. Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow as far as I can tell. 
__label__MCCOY He doesn't appear to be harmed. Physically, anyway. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered. 
__label__MCCOY What force?
__label__MCCOY Of course. Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions. 
__label__MCCOY The Oracle room. 
__label__MCCOY How's she doing? 
__label__MCCOY I can't leave Spock at this time. 
__label__MCCOY Ten yards the other way and we'd be boiled alive. 
__label__MCCOY Shall we tell them how they can reverse the effects of the field, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror. 
__label__MCCOY I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life. Regulations. 
__label__MCCOY No, but I've seen the book that contains all the knowledge of the creators. And if you  (He gets a warning pain, but fights through it.) 
__label__MCCOY What the devil is going on? 
__label__MCCOY We're not hungry. 
__label__MCCOY He'll recover, but he'll need further attention. Inform your superior. 
__label__MCCOY Yes? 
__label__MCCOY (checking tablets) Salt. 
__label__MCCOY Be careful. 
__label__MCCOY I know this is just my imagination but  LUCIEN: It is real, Doctor. Beautiful? No. But all our women are as young and beautiful as they want to be. So as to ensnare the man of her dreams, she needs an edge. 
__label__MCCOY You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.
__label__MCCOY The air seems fresh. It must be re-circulated somehow. 
__label__MCCOY Riley's gone. I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos.
__label__MCCOY I think we're in what corresponds to the small intestine. Those things growing out of the wall would be similar to villi. 
__label__MCCOY About our patient. 
__label__MCCOY The problem is, it could be anything Some spores or pollen in the air, some chemical. Just finding it could take months, maybe even years. And I've only got one lead. The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s. Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that. 
__label__MCCOY A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY You're four-oh. 
__label__MCCOY Transfusions? 
__label__MCCOY Your timing is lousy, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That thing can't die. 
__label__MCCOY Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible. 
__label__MCCOY It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice. 
__label__MCCOY Sit down and breathe deeply, please. 
__label__MCCOY Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I don't believe it, Spock. It's just not like you to give up trying. 
__label__MCCOY Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image like you? He already looks up to you. 
__label__MCCOY (screams) Killers! Assassins! I won't let you! I'll kill you first! I won't let you! You won't get me! Murderers! Killers! 
__label__MCCOY I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile field. 
__label__MCCOY Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air's too hot and thin for Kirk.
__label__MCCOY Simple but effective. 
__label__MCCOY Nurse, take this sample and run an analysis on it. 
__label__MCCOY Well, unless they treat their tribbles too, that ship isn't going to be big enough for all of them. 
__label__MCCOY It should for a while. 
__label__MCCOY Not exactly. He might be in trouble. 
__label__MCCOY That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago. 
__label__MCCOY Yes, a big one. Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of Earth-type environment down there. Now is it really there, or do we just think we see it down there? 
__label__MCCOY What's that? 
__label__MCCOY And the madness that affected the Defiant's crew will soon happen to the Enterprise. 
__label__MCCOY It's pretty certain to be the brain, Jim. The functioning of the brain is basically electric. 
__label__MCCOY Slaughter? Hundreds of people? 
__label__MCCOY Very funny. If it could, they wouldn't have to replace me. I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim, you haven't had much to say about this. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, my concoction actually worked. The fever's broken. And what recuperative powers. The infection's begun to drain already. 
__label__MCCOY What's bothering you, Jim? If we find the Klingons have helped the villagers, there's certainly something we can do. 
__label__MCCOY Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait. 
__label__MCCOY Of course. 
__label__MCCOY Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown. 
__label__MCCOY Right here, Miss Hedford. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet. 
__label__MCCOY Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical. Rome had no sun worshipers. Why should they parallel Rome in every way except one? 
__label__MCCOY Human, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called. Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology. Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age? After all, you're only a hundred and two. 
__label__MCCOY I know. As much as it might seem at times that I can't stand that pointy-eared encyclopaedia, I don't want to see that happen to him. 
__label__MCCOY No animals. That's peculiar. 
__label__MCCOY They registered as human. 
__label__MCCOY As well as flagrant medical blunders. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That's my observation, for whatever it's worth. 
__label__MCCOY No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms. 
__label__MCCOY Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu. His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted. Exploded from within. If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY It must've wiped out everything. 
__label__MCCOY No temperature yet, but we've got to get under way soon, Jim. I guarantee you, it will develop. What are we going to do? 
__label__MCCOY You don't think you're going? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I think she's coming around now. 
__label__MCCOY What? 
__label__MCCOY You and your Garden of Eden. 
__label__MCCOY Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse. 
__label__MCCOY Readings, Nurse. 
__label__MCCOY Just a minute. Let me get her on the rock. There you go. 
__label__MCCOY Sure it's wise, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four kilometres away. I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible. Everybody on board the Enterprise will  SPOCK: Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity, apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited. 
__label__MCCOY Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy. 
__label__MCCOY Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here. 
__label__MCCOY All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates. Approximately thirty years for each day. I don't know what's causing it. A virus, a bacteria, or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out. 
__label__MCCOY This is McCoy. Sandoval would like to talk to the Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Are you quite through shaking the ship around? 
__label__MCCOY No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we doing? 
__label__MCCOY You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet. 
__label__MCCOY I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and then he just wasn't there  RAEL [on viewer]: Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what's happening to us. (Spock slows down the playback, then speeds it up) Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what's happening to us. Nation of nine hundred thousand. City alone holding one hundred thirteen thousand. On which existed several culturally enlightened Indigenous population  (Finally it is speeded up to the familiar buzz or whine the crew have been hearing.) 
__label__MCCOY It was close, Jim. You both barely got back alive. Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again.
__label__MCCOY What can I do for you, Captain? 
__label__MCCOY Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they? 
__label__MCCOY Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party.
__label__MCCOY We don't have much time. 
__label__MCCOY What happened? 
__label__MCCOY We have prepared an antitoxin from the venom of the sur-snake, but a part of the old records is missing, so the exact dosage is unknown. Experiments on fish show that if the antitoxin is too strong, it causes over-mutation, which cannot be reversed by any means. We're running out of venom, so conclusive experiments are impossible. I decreased the strength by three quarters, Jim, but we can't be sure it's right. 
__label__MCCOY Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood  SPOCK: My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is.
__label__MCCOY Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many beliefs. 
__label__MCCOY Take it easy. Lie down, Scotty. We just want to check you out. 
__label__MCCOY Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back. 
__label__MCCOY Now you've got to get this ship out of here. 
__label__MCCOY But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject before  SPOCK: Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us. 
__label__MCCOY Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat. 
__label__MCCOY Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink. 
__label__MCCOY Maybe. Heart beat dropping. 
__label__MCCOY A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood. 
__label__MCCOY It won't work, Scotty. They'd have to cover thousands of miles through poisonous atmosphere before they'd ever reach the asylum. 
__label__MCCOY McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.
__label__MCCOY She refused. 
__label__MCCOY You saw their colour. There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their bodies. 
__label__MCCOY The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
__label__MCCOY At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien. 
__label__MCCOY It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system. 
__label__MCCOY Right. It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon. That'd just about wrap it  (He is interrupted by voices from outside. They hide.) 
__label__MCCOY Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be beaming through now. 
__label__MCCOY Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened? 
__label__MCCOY Number one on our list of things to do. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, what about that war on Epsilon Canaris Three? 
__label__MCCOY Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished? 
__label__MCCOY Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise. Her condition. 
__label__MCCOY No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they stumble on the right thing.
__label__MCCOY It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine. 
__label__MCCOY I know it can. 
__label__MCCOY I'm not sure I like that, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Stunned but coming around. I'm not sure it's wise to let her go off like that. 
__label__MCCOY As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at this. (a pair of large tracks in the soil) I saw what I saw, or maybe I hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you think about it. 
__label__MCCOY I'm going to get to the bottom of this right now. 
__label__MCCOY Then what were all those other creatures where we beamed down? 
__label__MCCOY Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down. 
__label__MCCOY He must be dead. And what's going on down there on Ekos? 
__label__MCCOY This isn't chicken soup. I may be just a ship's doctor, but I make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion. I strongly prescribe it, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Could have been an accident. 
__label__MCCOY It's unbelievable. 
__label__MCCOY Sure. A formal reception tonight, a hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks, thirty two of them ambassadors, (Spock joins them) half of them mad at the other half, and the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan question. 
__label__MCCOY Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go. 
__label__MCCOY Enterprise, alert! Stand by to beam up landing party. 
__label__MCCOY That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Long ago. Of course. Long ago.
__label__MCCOY It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead. 
__label__MCCOY But the effect will start wearing off in a minute, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY You should taste his food. Straw would taste better than his meat, and water a hundred times better than his brandy. Nothing has any taste at all. 
__label__MCCOY These men are friends. To force them to fight until one of them is killed  T'PAU: I can forgive such a display only once. Challenge was given and lawfully accepted. It has begun. Let no one interfere. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Captain. I've tried everything I can. Variant radiation, intense heat, even as great as nine thousand degrees. 
__label__MCCOY Life science bioscanners are picking up heart beats from over there. Can't be human, though. They're too faint, and average only four beats per minute. 
__label__MCCOY Absolutely sure. 
__label__MCCOY No, not like this. 
__label__MCCOY He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth. No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk. 
__label__MCCOY Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y three X point zero zero four. And I could use a second blood analyser unit.
__label__MCCOY And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship. 
__label__MCCOY We can't wait for those communicators any longer. 
__label__MCCOY And they disappeared through a hole in a hedge.
__label__MCCOY Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY I'm a doctor, not an engineer. 
__label__MCCOY Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock. Just as it's logical that twentieth-century Rome would use television to show its gladiator contests or name a new car the Jupiter Eight. 
__label__MCCOY Jim. Agreed you have the authority  KIRK: Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system. 
__label__MCCOY I suppose you're right. 
__label__MCCOY I'm sorry, Jim. The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive. 
__label__MCCOY I don't insist, Jim, but I can't dismiss the possibility. 
__label__MCCOY You were saying something about trick or treat.
__label__MCCOY Well, that was close, but you made it. 
__label__MCCOY That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable. 
__label__MCCOY What the devil's going on? 
__label__MCCOY What's he doing?
__label__MCCOY I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship. I can't do much for them down here. 
__label__MCCOY Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours. 
__label__MCCOY Who are the doctors? Who operates? 
__label__MCCOY No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked. 
__label__MCCOY I'm afraid I'll have to bow out. I have to continue with these medical examinations. However, if I find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, I  KIRK: He promised to throw away his shingle. 
__label__MCCOY Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.
__label__MCCOY I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn. 
__label__MCCOY No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later. 
__label__MCCOY Spock? 
__label__MCCOY In a pig's eye! 
__label__MCCOY Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health. A fringe benefit left over by the spores.
__label__MCCOY But he didn't kill, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY You're excused. You may return to your quarters. 
__label__MCCOY The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high, and The body functions will race many times their normal metabolism, so we're going to have to monitor this very carefully. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, a matter of days. Perhaps hours. 
__label__MCCOY This is Sickbay. Get me  (The door opens, and Chapel walks out, staring blankly ahead.) 
__label__MCCOY You would. 
__label__MCCOY What's happening? 
__label__MCCOY My prescription exactly. 
__label__MCCOY It attacked you? 
__label__MCCOY Jim. 
__label__MCCOY The Eugenics Wars. 
__label__MCCOY What happened? 
__label__MCCOY I'm doing what I can. (to Spock) You're perfectly healthy. 
__label__MCCOY Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way, and you lost. You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That's a boy. Keep it up. Work up a little sweat, it'll will do you good. (notices red alert)
__label__MCCOY Her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save Spock's sanity, perhaps even his life. 
__label__MCCOY Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree. 
__label__MCCOY It's still a risk. 
__label__MCCOY I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano. 
__label__MCCOY For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had our disagreements. Maybe they're jokes. I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is  SPOCK: Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief? 
__label__MCCOY What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion? 
__label__MCCOY She's not, Jim. No change in reading. She doesn't know. 
__label__MCCOY Something's wrong. 
__label__MCCOY Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Well, it was a. Oh, forget it. 
__label__MCCOY I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky. 
__label__MCCOY This instrument seems a little off. I've never gotten quite this reading from a human before. 
__label__MCCOY A stimulant. 
__label__MCCOY A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us could have been just like Miri. A child entering puberty on this planet means a death sentence. 
__label__MCCOY It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around? 
__label__MCCOY Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain. He's in a bad way, Captain.
__label__MCCOY What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've checked everywhere. 
__label__MCCOY One good slug of this, and you can hit a man with phaser stun, and he'd never feel it or even know it. 
__label__MCCOY Let's go. (McCoy and Bailey leave) 
__label__MCCOY The stimulant's working. 
__label__MCCOY Lie down, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the devil you keep from punching me in the face.
__label__MCCOY Why, that, that. Jim, if I'm ever in jail again, don't send that Vulcan to release me. Just let me rot.  
__label__MCCOY You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that! 
__label__MCCOY Erased?
__label__MCCOY Not now, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY How do you know so much? 
__label__MCCOY I would like to supervise that, of course. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, thank you, Christine.
__label__MCCOY I understand. 
__label__MCCOY I'll go with you. 
__label__MCCOY Did it hurt? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, sir. 
__label__MCCOY He looks drugged, Jim. Almost at a cataleptic state. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, yes. It was poisoned. 
__label__MCCOY I'll certify that right now. 
__label__MCCOY It's a waste of time if you ask me. 
__label__MCCOY He's dead.
__label__MCCOY And a table. 
__label__MCCOY Even if the kironide reaches the desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, that man is sick. Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job. 
__label__MCCOY Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief engineer, Starfleet, retired. 
__label__MCCOY And very simple. 
__label__MCCOY Captain. 
__label__MCCOY In which case you'd be guilty of murder. 
__label__MCCOY What is it? 
__label__MCCOY Thalassa? 
__label__MCCOY Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me. A chemical corrosion. Almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid. 
__label__MCCOY Orion? 
__label__MCCOY They're holding our Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Why? Why trick me? 
__label__MCCOY The word was smog. 
__label__MCCOY One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult. 
__label__MCCOY They must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet. 
__label__MCCOY Well now, it's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila. 
__label__MCCOY You just rest. 
__label__MCCOY The human small intestine is lined with millions of them, to absorb nutrients into the body. 
__label__MCCOY Learning to kill. 
__label__MCCOY Well, Mister Spock? (one figure is beamed back) Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Xenopolycythemia. It has no cure. 
__label__MCCOY Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear. 
__label__MCCOY Spock! No! 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I would agree. That's the case here. 
__label__MCCOY Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy? 
__label__MCCOY That's generations ahead of where these people should be technically. How'd they manage that? 
__label__MCCOY Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood  SPOCK: If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion. 
__label__MCCOY Well, that's fine. Where do we start? 
__label__MCCOY There's nothing else to be done. 
__label__MCCOY He'll live, but I'll have to get him to better facilities than this. 
__label__MCCOY Lieutenant  MIRA: Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you. 
__label__MCCOY It is my time to waste, Ambassador. 
__label__MCCOY It could be, Jim. That head injury. 
__label__MCCOY Completed. 
__label__MCCOY Probably because you're not very natural to begin with, Spock. 
__label__MCCOY How's that? 
__label__MCCOY They appear to be drugged, Jim. Look at their eyes. Hardly blink at all. 
__label__MCCOY You should've known what could've happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew. That is the mark of a starship Captain, like Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Feeling better?
__label__MCCOY I'm a surgeon already. If I could learn these techniques, I might be able to retain them. 
__label__MCCOY Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're ready, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY But at a dangerously low level. Well, we're still alive. I suppose that's something. 
__label__MCCOY Indeed we did, Mister Spock.
__label__MCCOY Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically non-existent.  KIRK: (goes to the door) Hanar? Hanar. 
__label__MCCOY We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots. 
__label__MCCOY What about medicine? Why no doctors? 
__label__MCCOY Give me a decision, Captain. He's coming out of it. 
__label__MCCOY But I don't know how. 
__label__MCCOY Acknowledged. 
__label__MCCOY I am not, Mister Spock. I was simply trying to stop you from giving us a whole lecture on the subject. Jim, is there anything at all we know about this planet? 
__label__MCCOY Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status? 
__label__MCCOY I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too. 
__label__MCCOY It's Jim! Here we are, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality. This is not a dream. 
__label__MCCOY Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people. 
__label__MCCOY This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim.
__label__MCCOY Don't bite into that! 
__label__MCCOY It'll be a few days. A week, at least, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY No comment. 
__label__MCCOY Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there anything we can do? 
__label__MCCOY Pull a gold watch from his vest and claim that he was late. 
__label__MCCOY Or by misleading the innocent. 
__label__MCCOY Guaranteed. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, it worked for her. It might work for me. 
__label__MCCOY Are you sure you're well enough to find your way alone? 
__label__MCCOY Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction.
__label__MCCOY I still say it can get us killed. 
__label__MCCOY This is real grass. 
__label__MCCOY Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does. 
__label__MCCOY She's dead. 
__label__MCCOY While you're talking, they're planning attacks. This is a fight to the death. We'd better start trying to win it! 
__label__MCCOY Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here? 
__label__MCCOY Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into. 
__label__MCCOY I'm a doctor, Spock, a doctor. Get us beamed aboard. 
__label__MCCOY You don't think by any chance that Scotty  KIRK: It doesn't make any difference what I think. 
__label__MCCOY But four hundred Vulcans? 
__label__MCCOY Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that thermoconcrete. You know, the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of. It's mostly silicone. So I just trowelled it into the wound, and it'll act like a bandage until it heals. Take a look. It's as good as new. 
__label__MCCOY If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain. Is that your simple logic, Mister Spock? 
__label__MCCOY Well, it could have been worse.
__label__MCCOY You sound like you're cutting a diamond. 
__label__MCCOY Spock? 
__label__MCCOY It's all right. I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle. 
__label__MCCOY Mister Spock! Something's happening outside. 
__label__MCCOY Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own. It happens to belong to a young woman. 
__label__MCCOY I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there. 
__label__MCCOY Well, I guess that answers our questions, Mister Scott. They're not very friendly, are they? 
__label__MCCOY Jim, I want you to hear this. 
__label__MCCOY I'm working in the dark. I could kill him. 
__label__MCCOY I'd say no. 
__label__MCCOY As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY That is correct. 
__label__MCCOY We've been led here. Why? 
__label__MCCOY Jones' genetic engineering was very slipshod. Jim. He may have kept the tribbles from reproducing, but he didn't slow down their metabolism. You see, they're not just giant tribbles, they're colonies.
__label__MCCOY No, definitely human, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY His heart is different! The internal organs of a Vulcan are  CLOUD: Bring him. 
__label__MCCOY I have the autopsy report on Marvick. Heart action stopped, cause unknown. Respiration stopped, cause unknown.
__label__MCCOY Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand. 
__label__MCCOY But M-5 doesn't know it's a game. 
__label__MCCOY Killers! Killers! I won't let you get me! I'll kill you first! I won't let you get me! Assassins! Murderers! Killers! 
__label__MCCOY Jim, this ship is dissolving. My hand just passed through a man  [Defiant Bridge]
__label__MCCOY I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't believe that you would want Jim's command.
__label__MCCOY How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be so helpless?
__label__MCCOY He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand. Let's let him rest. 
__label__MCCOY As a matter of fact, yes. 
__label__MCCOY Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.
__label__MCCOY Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim. 
__label__MCCOY Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want?
__label__MCCOY Captain, I'm getting no life form register. 
__label__MCCOY Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius. 
__label__MCCOY What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed. 
__label__MCCOY Release him.
__label__MCCOY Honesty is usually wise. 
__label__MCCOY Meadows and no meteor craters. The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally. 
__label__MCCOY (scanning him) Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is.
__label__MCCOY Sargon, it won't work. You've got to get out before you kill them. 
__label__MCCOY Stop it! You're killing them! Stop it, please! Stop it! You're choking them! Let them go. You're choking them! Stop it! 
__label__MCCOY In addition, an assortment of swords and knives. 
__label__MCCOY Spock, you obviously don't understand  SPOCK: Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept  KIRK: Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war.
__label__MCCOY Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing back in our universe? 
__label__MCCOY There are evidences of gram-positive bacteria. It's carried by humanoids without ill effect, but staphylococcus strains don't seem to be native to this planet. It must have been like a plague. 
__label__MCCOY The last one. Robert Johnson. Cause of death, old age. 
__label__MCCOY (lying on bed) I was so worried. Your husband acting strange, crewmen dying. 
__label__MCCOY Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger now. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again. 
__label__MCCOY Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus, like a a plant parasite. It's the nearest biological form of life I can find. 
__label__MCCOY It worked! We can do it. What's the matter, Jim? We can do it. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, you should see the research facilities. They've got a lab down there that. Well, I could spend the rest of my life studying it. 
__label__MCCOY Well, she checks out with no brain damage. We've got all the educational tapes in our library. Now it's up to us. 
__label__MCCOY What are you doing? 
__label__MCCOY They're useless. 
__label__MCCOY I'm especially honoured to meet you, Mister Winston. My daughter was going to school on Cerberus about ten years ago when the crop failure occurred. The entire population would've starved, Jim, if Winston here hadn't used his personal fortune to bring in enough food and goods to carry them through the crisis. 
__label__MCCOY Right. What the devil's wrong with communications? Esteban.
__label__MCCOY That's strange. 
__label__MCCOY Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet. 
__label__MCCOY Of course you didn't. I told the Captain. 
__label__MCCOY Twenty two so far. Mainly radiation burns, mostly from the ship's outer areas. Could have been much, much worse, Captain. 
__label__MCCOY You do that very well. Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment? 
__label__MCCOY Let me see that arm. 
__label__MCCOY Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly. Their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average. 
__label__MCCOY My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone. 
__label__MCCOY And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.
__label__MCCOY I'm ready, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk by, please. (scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do that. 
__label__MCCOY Are the readings corresponding, Nurse? 
__label__MCCOY Spock, I  SPOCK: Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel. 
__label__MCCOY Scotty. 
__label__MCCOY If this thing does have some kind of digestive system, we don't stand much of a chance of making it that far. 
__label__MCCOY That's a fine thing to leave lying around. Show us where it is. 
__label__MCCOY What's the matter, Jim? 
__label__MCCOY Only one signal. What happened? 
__label__MCCOY The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her. 
__label__MCCOY Unfortunately, you're both right. It's the only thing we can do.
__label__MCCOY You noticed that, huh? Here. This ought to take care of it. 
__label__MCCOY Then let's move before we all turn into icicles. 
__label__MCCOY Then it's possible the transference can be broken. 
__label__MCCOY And what if we should decide against you? 
__label__MCCOY That hurts worse than the uniform. 
__label__MCCOY Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice. 
__label__MCCOY Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mister Spock. 
__label__MCCOY Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock, and that is also something new for you. 
__label__MCCOY Now you're beginning to make sense. 
__label__MCCOY You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie.
__label__MCCOY We don't even know it it's the right one. 
__label__MCCOY Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late.
__label__MCCOY She called it a Borgia plant. 
__label__MCCOY Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians. 
__label__MCCOY What has Karidian to do with it? 
__label__MCCOY She's asleep. 
__label__MCCOY I think so. Looks like some kind of shock. 
__label__MCCOY But in all the confusion I  KIRK: Tell me. 
__label__MCCOY Well, so much for mythology. 
__label__MCCOY What the devil is that? 
__label__MCCOY No! No! (They struggle for the phaser. Spock gets between Nancy and Kirk.)
