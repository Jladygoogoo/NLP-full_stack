"We are not tourists here, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
Now. ,KIRK
The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It resembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths.,SPOCK
You say you can communicate with it. Perhaps you can find out what we're doing here. ,KIRK
"All right, Ensign. You can go. Thank you very much. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? ",KIRK
"Well, you're due in surgery. I'm going to bob your ears. ",MCCOY
It's all right. ,KIRK
"Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to command. I'm losing the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"Take no action, Mister Hansen.",SPOCK
I'll explain when I see the Fuhrer. ,KIRK
Sounds like Don Juan.,MCCOY
By understanding every life comes to an end when time demands it. Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted.,SPOCK
"The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet. ",SPOCK
"Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio. ",KIRK

"Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search? ",SPOCK
"I'm happy. I'm so happy. If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace. ",KIRK
"Goodnight, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Plum? ,KIRK
A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body. It's only experimental. ,MCCOY

This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over.,KIRK

"That'll do. Full ahead, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass. ,SPOCK

Please. ,KIRK
"No evidence of intelligent life. Atmosphere at surface, eight hundred millibars, breathable. Gravity one point two. Temperature hot, but within Class M limits. ",SPOCK
And what do you think they felt? ,KIRK
You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch. ,MCCOY
Arrange quarters for Professor and Mrs. Crater. Did you get the plant analysis? ,KIRK

You can turn command over to Scotty. ,MCCOY
"Ship's life support systems fading. Jim, we need oxygen. ",MCCOY
"We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal satisfaction. Is that clear? Let's try down there. ",KIRK
Yes. Another conventional weapon. It appears the total conversion beam was the only thing the Slavers had that we do not. ,SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, use your scanners to assemble a diagram of the cloud's composition and feed it to the library computer. ",KIRK
"Well, well, what's happening? ",MCCOY
"Mister Johnson, can you hear me? ",KIRK
Picking up two life-forms in the gallery. ,SPOCK
Start scanning. Let's find that alien. ,KIRK
"Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit.",KIRK
I said beam me aboard. ,KIRK
My duty as an officer is to obey him. ,SPOCK
"That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty. ",KIRK
Anything? ,SPOCK
"Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously? ",SPOCK
"Slaves and gladiators. What are we seeing, a twentieth-century Rome? ",KIRK
"If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier. ",SPOCK
Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment. ,KIRK
"You can't let him do this, Spock. ",MCCOY
"I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable. ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, get us the devil out of here! Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the Bridge. Lieutenant, all decks, damage report. ",KIRK
This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise.,KIRK

All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they look like? Where do they live? ,KIRK
Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan. ,SPOCK
"No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine. Lung efficiency is fifty percent better. ",MCCOY
"Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape. ",MCCOY
"I can't infect the planet, Captain. And I can get McCoy. ",SPOCK
"What is it, Nurse?",SPOCK
I don't think so. ,MCCOY
Do you deny it? ,KIRK
"Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones, you come with me. ",KIRK
We got off! ,MCCOY
Mister Spock? (goes to intercom) Mister Spock. I have not yet transported down. Why did you leave your post before confirming transport? Mister Spock? Spock? ,KIRK
"That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do. ",SPOCK
"Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature. A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements? ",MCCOY
We're going to need help in all those areas. ,MCCOY
He's regaining consciousness.,SPOCK
Peace and tranquillity to you. (in a whisper) Are you all right? ,KIRK

What's wrong? ,KIRK
"What makes you think you can interfere with  METRON [OC]: It is you who are interfering. We are simply putting a stop to it. The place we have prepared for you contains sufficient elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other, which seems to be your intention. The winner of the contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed. The loser, along with his ship, shall be destroyed in the interests of peace. The contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity, brute strength against brute strength. The results will be final. ",KIRK
Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara? ,KIRK
It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds. ,KIRK
"It's not necessary, Captain. It's very simple. Nothing can go wrong. ",MCCOY
He's dying. Something's happened to his brain. Electrical activity decreasing. ,MCCOY
It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear. ,KIRK
Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim! ,SPOCK

"Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I wonder when his T'Pring arrives. ,MCCOY
Mister Boma? ,SPOCK
You said it was fused. How? ,SPOCK
"Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow, one on the stern. Distance, two hundred thousand kilometres and closing. ",SPOCK
"Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch, by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful. ",KIRK
"Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse.",SPOCK
But not as safe. ,SPOCK
"These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger with each passing day. However, the dreams return every night.",KIRK
"I'm afraid I'll have to bow out. I have to continue with these medical examinations. However, if I find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, I  KIRK: He promised to throw away his shingle. ",MCCOY
You will recall we recognised at least two species from vastly different planets. The environment did not appear natural to this planet. A technology this advanced could easily travel to other star systems to collect specimens. ,SPOCK
That makes sense. ,KIRK
"We're on our way, Doctor. We'll be with you in a moment.",KIRK
Keep those screens up. Fire all phasers. ,KIRK
I was unable to accept. My life is here. ,SPOCK
"I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was nothing there. And it's just happened again. Could I be imagining it? ",KIRK
"We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar system.",SPOCK
"Turn it down a little. Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship. Doctor McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing. ",KIRK
"Thank you, Yeoman.",KIRK
"Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task. ",SPOCK
"Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again. ",MCCOY
Tell me about it. ,KIRK
We're short of tools. ,KIRK

Gentlemen. ,KIRK
That's twice you've referred to us as my children. ,KIRK

Someone tried to kill him. ,SPOCK
"Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can be shorted out? ",MCCOY
Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any of us interfere_ (Charlie enters under guard) ,SPOCK
I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it? ,SPOCK
"Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato. ",MCCOY

Stand by. Do you read any Romulans? ,KIRK

You guess? ,SPOCK
Marple! ,KIRK
Five-minute report. Kirk out. ,KIRK
I thought Vulcans didn't have a sense of humour. ,KIRK
"Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own. ",SPOCK
"Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we cannot be positive. ",SPOCK
"Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was a spaceship. ",SPOCK
"No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever. ",KIRK
Odd that these people should worship the sun. ,MCCOY

"Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor.",KIRK
"I'll be right up. You could see the alarm lights flashing from there, McCoy. Why didn't you tell me?",KIRK
"Chekov may be right. The Klingons claim to have honoured the truce, but there have been incidents, raids on our outposts. ",MCCOY
"He's reaching a level of consciousness. It's almost like he's in a light sleep. Now, that's as much as I dare do. ",MCCOY

I can't get a correlation with any known poison. ,MCCOY
"Strange. We did no damage, but the Romulan is retreating anyway.",SPOCK
And if the Klingons give their side even more? ,MCCOY
So they keep their word scrupulously. They're unusually honest.,KIRK
"I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others.",SPOCK
Battle status? ,KIRK
May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant. ,SPOCK

Good morning. ,KIRK
Spock. Can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we were? ,KIRK
"An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern. ",KIRK
A friend. Activate the transporter. You saved us back at Sickbay with the Tantalus field. ,KIRK

Spock knows. ,KIRK

Courtesy. Remember? ,KIRK

Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself. ,SPOCK
"I am formulating a theory, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Where's does that sound coming from? Spock, can you pinpoint it? ",KIRK
So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream. Body functions seem normal.,MCCOY
We're floating inside the cloud. ,MCCOY
Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment. ,KIRK

"Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen. Set a course for Starbase Four. ",KIRK
"We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero. SPOCK: There is, of course, a logical alternative. Kang's wife is, after all, our prisoner. Perhaps a threat. ",SPOCK

I don't understand it. She's not sick at all. ,MCCOY

I don't understand. ,KIRK
Excuse me. ,MCCOY
How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be so helpless?,MCCOY
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
"How are you doing, Doc? ",KIRK
She will not. She is fighting for her own identity. ,KIRK

"I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look. ",SPOCK
"I've triple-checked, Jim. I wish to God I was wrong. Spock's blood is copper-based. The infection enters the blood stream, and encases the cells so they can't carry oxygen. ",MCCOY
"Your logic is excellent, Captain. There is a random factor to the ship disappearances. Perhaps the touching of the two time continuums is erratic. In any event, the window stayed open long enough for us to follow the Klothos in. ",SPOCK
"No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep! ",MCCOY
"Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy. If you will grant permission  HODIN [on viewscreen]: Of course, we shall institute a thorough search.",SPOCK
Yes. It's all right. We can help them now. ,MCCOY

"The blindness was temporary, Jim. There's something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's. ",MCCOY
You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as quickly as possible. (leaves) ,KIRK
"A phaser! Come on! (arriving at the scene) Garrovick, did you? ",KIRK
Full sensor scan of the ship. Report on any movement by the Klingons. The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling tradition. They think they can beat us with swords. ,KIRK
I suggest that we get these seawater and algae specimens.,MCCOY
Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.,KIRK
"It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down. ",SPOCK

Enterprise to Tantalus colony.,KIRK
"A moment, Captain. The results are unclear. ",SPOCK
"She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned. ",SPOCK
Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of inhabitants there. ,KIRK
"No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are those phasers? ",KIRK
"Also logical, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected.",SPOCK
You really think it's that serious? ,MCCOY
Where are we? ,KIRK
"The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control. ",SPOCK
Name it. ,KIRK
"Progress report, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
To say the least. ,KIRK
Initiate warp six. ,KIRK
Engage.,KIRK
"Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and the lives of millions like you. If you help me, maybe I can do it. If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on. Or are you that fond of the war?",KIRK
"An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter. ",SPOCK
I can't. ,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and I will handle this. ",KIRK
"Had I not touched them, I would have agreed with you, Captain.",SPOCK
This ship is going to Ariannus. ,KIRK
I'll take my chances. ,KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But what people created this? Are there any representatives here? ",SPOCK
"No, I don't think so. It'll spoil your dinner. ",KIRK
"And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship. ",SPOCK

Bridge.,KIRK
"Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office. ",SPOCK
"Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside. ",SPOCK
Do you have any ideas? ,KIRK
"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. ",MCCOY
"Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation. ",SPOCK

"Well, Mister Scott seems to agree with you. The two of you meet me in the transporter room on the double. ",KIRK
Captain? Captain? Captain?,SPOCK
"Read out, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because you found a discrepancy in a hydrogen cloud? ,MCCOY
"I concur, Mister Spock. Set phasers to stun, just in case. ",KIRK
Us? ,KIRK
Stop it? I'm counting on it. ,KIRK
"No information on that as yet, sir. I do have one read-out on full spiroid wave analysis. That will take approximately eight years. ",SPOCK
Kirk out. ,KIRK

"Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones. ",KIRK
I can't hold out against that many. ,KIRK
"There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children.",KIRK
"I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far as I could tell, she was being attacked. ",KIRK
"I didn't realise I was so hungry. Whatever you call this, it is very good. ",KIRK
He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains. ,SPOCK
What do the crystals have to do with it? All they show us the point of radiation. ,KIRK
What earns Spock your special interest? ,KIRK
"Sir, you are employing a double negative. ",SPOCK
Anything? ,KIRK
"Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return.",SPOCK
Check it. ,KIRK
A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?,KIRK
"Bones, you all right? ",KIRK
"I don't know, Bones. We're here to find out what's happened because I don't know. ",KIRK
"It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock. ",KIRK

"(in pain) Captain, go. I. You must destroy the  KIRK: What is it? ",SPOCK
Activate beams. ,KIRK
What is your authorisation? From what source? ,KIRK
"Goodbye, Harry. Have fun. ",KIRK
The turbulence hit you that hard? ,KIRK
Good. We want him to be a sterling witness. ,KIRK
But maintain general quarters. Scan this sector for other ships.,KIRK
"Stand by, Enterprise. (The cloud reaches them) Now! Energise and detonate! ",KIRK
Phasers are dead! Run for the cave! ,KIRK
These are the most beautiful women in the galaxy. But where are the men? ,MCCOY
"No choice, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
The Disrupters? Who are they? ,SPOCK
How many more in your crew? ,SPOCK
"Just that. All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life form registering. No, now it's gone._ KIRK: As though a door opened and closed. ",MCCOY
Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own. It happens to belong to a young woman. ,MCCOY

"Captain, we are being watched. ",SPOCK
I'll explain later. ,MCCOY
"Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us. ",MCCOY
Or attack. ,KIRK
I cannot take sides. ,KIRK
Sickbay to lab. Anything new on those bios? ,MCCOY
"I know what you're saying, Jim, but if you go down on that planet and you die there  KIRK: Right now we have only two choices. Live in an aquarium somewhere for the rest of our lives or stay on Argo. I won't accept either one of them. ",MCCOY
"On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement? ",SPOCK
"McCoy! He's in  (McCoy comes out and they greet each other enthusiastically. A truck is coming down the street as Edith starts to cross, not looking.) ",KIRK
"No, but thank you anyway. ",KIRK
Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.,SPOCK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
"We're travelling at a safe distance from the nova, Mrs. April. ",SPOCK
"Less than an hour, Jim. His body functions are slipping fast now. ",MCCOY
Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov? ,KIRK
Stand by to beam up landing party. ,KIRK
"Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible. Bring all available biographical material with you. Kirk out. Mister Spock, come with me. ",KIRK
"This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation business. Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference. ",KIRK
"An entire human colony, a whole settlement. One hundred men, women and children. Who did it? And why? (communicator beep) Kirk here.",KIRK
"Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck. Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony? ",KIRK
"Well, Jaris is all right. ",MCCOY
We've got to get out of here. ,KIRK
Keep those screens up. Worry about us when the ship is safe. ,KIRK
"I think I see  (But a volcanic eruption knocks him off his feet and he drops the communicator. It gets hit with a globule of lava. Kirk runs for it, dodging lava flows until he finds a miniature city. Then he is caught in a transporter beam) ",KIRK
"No, he didn't. (gets out communicator) Spock? See to the landing parties, would you, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Only one signal. What happened? ,MCCOY
Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room. His men have control of the ship. ,SPOCK
I'm glad to hear it. ,MCCOY
Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck. ,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing? ",KIRK
"Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside. ",SPOCK
It's like a vast Sargasso Sea. A graveyard of ships from every civilisation imaginable. ,KIRK
"The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive. ",SPOCK
Not really. ,KIRK
"You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot, every opening. You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. Phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this. Fifty people have died. I want no more deaths. ",KIRK
"Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a great deal. I see no practical use for them. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Captain? ",SPOCK
It might be. Come with me.,KIRK
"We'll get you, Spock. It won't be long. ",KIRK
"It seems a logical assumption, Captain. ",SPOCK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
You mean it makes a good bowstring. ,KIRK
"What is it, Gabler. ",KIRK
"Yes, Bones. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, historical report. ",KIRK
"This is a barren world. Limited vegetation, no apparent animal life. ",MCCOY
"(helps her out of vent) Helen, are you all right? (kisses her) ",KIRK
The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore. ,SPOCK
"Bones, I need some answers. What's happening to us? ",KIRK
"Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing to wage real war with real weapons. They'll want do the same. Only the next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a computer. They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet. You of course will want to retaliate. If I were you, I'd start making bombs. Yes, Councilman, you have a real war on your hands. You can either wage it with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative. Put an end to it. Make peace._ ANAN: There can be no peace. Don't you see? We've admitted it to ourselves. We're a killer species. It's instinctive. It's the same with you. Your General Order Twenty Four. ",KIRK
What alternative? ,KIRK
I don't know. ,MCCOY
"Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well. ",KIRK
We agree. ,KIRK
"I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious state. He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear.",MCCOY
Release the transmitter. ,KIRK
They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of it.,SPOCK
What? ,KIRK
"He's too young, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Someone special. A perfect specimen, perhaps. Yes, I've heard it too. ",KIRK
"Nurse, would you mind, please? ",MCCOY
Quite correct. ,SPOCK
"Yes, he is. ",KIRK
"Doctor, just come with me, please. ",SPOCK
I have a feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to. ,KIRK
Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates. ,SPOCK
"The last slide I examined, I failed to make the necessary adjustment. The slowing down of my own responses  KIRK: Never mind that, what did you find? ",MCCOY
A simple transference. Their minds and ours. ,KIRK

We're free people. We belong to no one. ,KIRK

"Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha? ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, we have guests. Adjust transporter to wide field.",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not life as we know it at all. ,SPOCK
The alien is the real threat. That's the enemy we have to wipe out. ,KIRK
"That's more like it. Since the Capellans never developed the bow, this may come as big a surprise as gunpowder was on Earth. ",KIRK
"Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for maximum power generation. Compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship. ",SPOCK
Agreed. We'll try to make for the eye of the storm. ,KIRK

Very well. Kirk out. ,KIRK

I am inside you. ,SPOCK

"Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me. ",SPOCK
"Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.",SPOCK
"In other words, it's too good to be true. ",KIRK
No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an agreement.,KIRK
"Oh, I find that shocking. ",MCCOY
"Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you? ",KIRK
Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it. ,SPOCK

There were no witnesses? ,KIRK

The term is amusement park.,SPOCK
"Its metabolic rate. It's impossibly high as if it's burning itself up, almost as if it aged a century in just the past few minutes.",MCCOY
He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan. ,SPOCK
"It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind.",SPOCK
Lock on to secondary city. ,SPOCK
"Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report?",MCCOY
Spock? ,KIRK
You better come back with me to the library. You'll be safe there. Doctor McCoy can see to those bruises. ,KIRK
"Captain, I just read some fresh signs. ",SPOCK
"It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly! ",SPOCK
We've got to save him. ,KIRK
"My muscles are sore, that's all. ",KIRK
Captain! Jim! ,SPOCK
"We're tired, sore, hurt and angry, but we're also just about there. I'll scout ahead. Everybody else stay together, keep moving. ",KIRK
"That doesn't surprise me, Mister Spock. I can't imagine a mirage ever disturbing those mathematically perfect brain waves of yours. ",MCCOY
Examining you. ,MCCOY
"Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.",SPOCK
Give us your transporter co-ordinates. We're beaming aboard. ,KIRK

"How's it going down there, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
Captain  [Romulan ship],SPOCK
"Oh, yes. ",KIRK
"Well, I've got one and I definitely don't like it. I'd guess they're doing exactly what we would do. ",MCCOY
Fire. ,KIRK
Kirk to Sickbay. ,KIRK
"I know it, Scotty. ",MCCOY
"Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is anything wrong? ",SPOCK
"This was three hundred years ago, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Never mind the chit-chat. I've got my medical scanners all set up for a Vulcan. I have to recalibrate every time I run a physical on you, Spock. ",MCCOY
I'll get out of his way. ,KIRK

"Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result  OXMYX: The most co-operative man in this world is a dead man. And if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're going to be co-operatin'. ",SPOCK

"No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan. ",SPOCK
What's going on down there? ,KIRK
All right. I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes. I'll meet you in Sickbay afterward. ,KIRK
"A trick, then? A projection? ",KIRK
"Feel free to look around, Captain. Don't touch anything, but I think you'll find it interesting. ",KIRK
Exactly. ,SPOCK
"Captain, its registering energy. Very little, but building. ",SPOCK
They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society. ,SPOCK
It was quite a hike here. You're tired. Just take it easy for a while. ,MCCOY
"Scotty, stand by. We're doing the best we can. How's Mister Sulu?",KIRK
"Yes, Captain. What did you want? ",SPOCK
"Oh, yes. ",KIRK
"Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll contact. ",KIRK
"Dimensional visions. Any idea what's causing them, Spock? ",KIRK
Good heavens. This is a Capellan power-cat. No one's ever been able to keep one alive. ,MCCOY
"Bones, any opinion? ",KIRK
Can you trust all your men? ,KIRK
I do? ,MCCOY
"Bones, can you do something? ",KIRK
Sybo said it feeds on death. ,MCCOY
Then we could be in the wrong.,MCCOY
I'm getting reports from every deck. Half the people on this ship just fainted. ,MCCOY
Fire phasers. ,SPOCK
"Accepted, Doctor. ",KIRK
Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters. ,SPOCK
What are you doing on my ship? ,KIRK
"Yes, very lonely. ",MCCOY
It was infused into your bodies at key structural points. It had to be done by injection. ,MCCOY
"That's impossible. We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon. I tried to beam down, something happened, and you were beamed aboard from Gideon. ",KIRK
There is no medicine that can help him. He'll have to come through this himself. ,MCCOY
"Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies. ",KIRK
"Understood, Engineer. Mister Spock? We can't avoid these areas of turbulence. ",KIRK
"I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down. ",SPOCK
I have given you new programming and you will implement it. ,KIRK

"Captain, something is beaming aboard this vessel. ",SPOCK
Hey! Somebody! Anybody! ,MCCOY
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
"Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest. He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship from your captain. A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny.",KIRK
"Yes, Lindstrom. ",KIRK
"Captain, I see on your report Flavius was killed. I am sorry. I liked that huge sun worshiper. ",MCCOY
We'll leave when the gas has effect. ,KIRK
Well? ,KIRK
"I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe. ",MCCOY
"Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position. ",SPOCK
My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador. ,SPOCK
"A slingshot effect to yank us out of orbit. Can you compute it in your mind? If we try to use ship's computers  SPOCK: The alien will know. I believe I can, Captain. I will need to aid Mister Scott. ",KIRK

"You're leaving with the ship, Doctor. ",KIRK
Dr. McCoy? ,KIRK
Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well. ,MCCOY
"It would never occur to me, Captain. ",SPOCK
I know it's a book. ,KIRK
"What does it mean, we are Nomad? ",KIRK
"Kang! Kang, this is Captain Kirk. ",KIRK
"Increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what happened to you? ,KIRK
Heart beat now fifty two and increasing. ,MCCOY
Why did you kill that man? ,KIRK
"My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What happened, what happened was an accident. ",KIRK
"Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I could sense it thinking, planning. ",KIRK
"I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The polarized elements would burn out quickly. ",SPOCK
"Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there. ",KIRK
We shall arrive in your office within ten minutes. Spock out. ,SPOCK
"Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist. ",SPOCK
It appears so. ,SPOCK
"Captain's log, stardate 3417.7. Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. Mutinied.",KIRK
And that is impossible. ,SPOCK
Finnegan. Finnegan! What's been happening to my people?,KIRK
We'll be right there. ,KIRK
"Communications, emergency medical team. ",KIRK
"I would say so, Captain. The instinctive reaction of all frightened creatures is to retreat to a place of safety. ",SPOCK
He'll be all right now. ,KIRK
Look at his face. ,KIRK
(bleeding) It's waiting for you. It may only be a matter of months. ,KIRK
"Yes, quite all right. I'd like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs, please. Have you got that? ",KIRK
"My work, Jim. This is prescription stuff. Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman. ",MCCOY
"Maintain thrust, Scotty. While we're maintaining our distance, Mister Spock, have you ascertained yet what we're maintaining our distance from? ",KIRK
"Areel. Doctor McCoy said you were here. I should have felt it in the air, like static electricity. ",KIRK
What you want is unimportant right now. What you will get is required by the book. ,MCCOY
He did not pay royalties. ,SPOCK
"Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time. ",KIRK
"Bones, Spock. since you are playing this tape, we will assume that I am dead, that the tactical situation is critical, and both of you are locked in mortal combat. It means, Spock, that you have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career. I can offer only one small piece of advice, for whatever it's worth. Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship. But temper your judgment with intuitive insight.",KIRK
"I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us. It's in that direction, and it doesn't read solid. It's more unstable, tenuous, like a collection of gases. ",MCCOY
That was quite a scene. ,KIRK
Spock has contracted the disease. It's fatal to Vulcans. ,MCCOY
Hypo. ,MCCOY
"Security teams report no sign of the alien on this deck, Captain. ",SPOCK
This hearing is closed. ,KIRK
How am I otherwise? ,KIRK
I never met a rose that didn't. ,KIRK
"No, sir. ",SPOCK
How could this have seemed right to John Gill? ,KIRK
Are you going to let him get away with that?,MCCOY
He's pretty fast with that whip. ,KIRK
"Me? I'm a doctor. If I were an officer of the line, I'd SCOTT: Would you have me open fire? ",MCCOY
And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries old. ,SPOCK
Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that? ,KIRK
"Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were KIRK: Irrational, or drugged.",SPOCK
"This is Sickbay. Get me  (The door opens, and Chapel walks out, staring blankly ahead.) ",MCCOY
There's some kind of interference on all channels. We're going to have to get out of this village on our own. ,KIRK
You all right? ,KIRK
"This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a practical invisibility screen. ",SPOCK
Put on your masks. ,MCCOY
"I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor. ",MCCOY
"Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there? ",MCCOY

Prepare two ccs of stokaline. ,MCCOY
"Four to beam up, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Please, not again.",KIRK
"Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps? ",MCCOY
"Captain Christopher. Captain Christopher? Security, this is the Captain. ",KIRK
"Yes, sir.",MCCOY
Did you hear them? ,KIRK
U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.,KIRK
Interesting. ,SPOCK
I did. ,MCCOY
"It's one of the possibilities we've discussed. (to Vanderberg) I want your people to stay on the top level, together at a safe place. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, I certainly am glad to see you. I thought you and the Enterprise had been destroyed. ",KIRK
This is the vaccine? ,KIRK
"Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing.",KIRK
"Is that's all you can do, smile? ",KIRK
And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out. ,KIRK
"Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1?_ SPOCK: 7,824.7 to 1. ",KIRK
"Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control. ",KIRK
I said get back to your station. ,KIRK
"Let me try. This is Captain James T Kirk speaking. You are programmed to obey any direct order I may give, correct? ",KIRK
Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course. ,SPOCK
"Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and find out that you were living on a big ball. Not a planet, but a spaceship. And that knowledge seems to be forbidden. ",KIRK
"Never mind, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"What did you hope to gain by that, Jim? ",MCCOY
"Full alert. Tricorder readings, Mister Spock. Life detection.",KIRK
Incredible. ,KIRK
"It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago.",KIRK
I like them better than I like you. ,MCCOY
Emergency power to tractor beams. Bridge to Transporter room.,KIRK
"I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Kirk to Bridge. ,KIRK
He's also half human.,KIRK
"Now, that's just lovely. ",KIRK
"All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place. You ought to see it. ",KIRK
"My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz. ",KIRK
"I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life  KIRK: There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear?",SPOCK
Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building. ,KIRK
"Captain, our phasers are gone. ",SPOCK
"Ad infinitum, perhaps, considering distance between atoms is relatively as great as between stars. ",SPOCK
"Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god needs compassion. Mitchell! Elizabeth. ",KIRK
"As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim. ",MCCOY
Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher.,SPOCK
Do you get a magnetic flux reading there now? ,KIRK
Did he seem upset? ,KIRK
"We're picking up an object, sir. Much larger, coming toward us.",SPOCK
I need Nurse Chapel. ,MCCOY
We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an official establishment. ,SPOCK
"We can beam up, Tracey. All of us. ",KIRK
You've made your point. ,KIRK
"Merely an observation, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Check it, Spock. ",KIRK
"Jim, can you hear us? ",MCCOY
"All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow. ",MCCOY
"Worries, Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
Am I disturbing you? ,KIRK
"What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust? ",KIRK
"Are you satisfied? Spock, why did you do it?",MCCOY
Prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass. ,KIRK
I'm going to get to the bottom of this right now. ,MCCOY
"Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we furnish the provocation. ",MCCOY
Mister Sulu.,KIRK
"Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help. ",MCCOY
"Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time. ",SPOCK
"What those children saw is incredible, Jim. The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia. That's my diagnosis. Until specific tests can be made, it remains that. ",MCCOY
"If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link. ",SPOCK
"No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system. ",SPOCK
"My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling display of logic. ",SPOCK
Second?,KIRK
Set your phasers on stun. We're going to beam directly into the capital city. Alert status. Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Not yet. ,SPOCK
"First, the Captain. Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"A Vendorian, Doctor. Their planet is quarantined, and few people ever do see them. Their ability to rearrange their molecular structure into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of deceit as a way of life puts them off limits. ",SPOCK
But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities. It'd be a miracle if they had developed it. ,KIRK
"I wouldn't like that, Shahna. I wouldn't like that at all. ",KIRK
"Let's get there as fast as we can. If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there. ",KIRK
"There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative energy. ",SPOCK
I cut the transporter power. It was necessary to delay your beam-out until I could arrive. Take him. ,SPOCK
"No, I'll be right down. Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance. (communicator beeps) Spock here. ",SPOCK
"Compared to the beings that built this ship, we are primitive people, even you, Mister Spock. All right, let's keep going. ",KIRK
Spock. ,KIRK
Human. ,KIRK
"Mister Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called. Forgive my curiosity, but as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology. Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age? After all, you're only a hundred and two. ",MCCOY
Cancel implementation of General Order Twenty Four. Alert transporter room. We're ready to beam up. ,KIRK
That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat! ,MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Johnson? ,KIRK
"Well, keep trying, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
I can't. ,KIRK
"Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room. The term was neural neutraliser.",SPOCK
"You do that very well. Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment? ",MCCOY
Keep talking! ,KIRK
"Quite clear, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, at the academy. He was dropped in his fifth year. He went into the merchant service. ",KIRK
"There's that magic word again. Does your logic find this fascinating, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there.,KIRK
"That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister Scott. Fuel status? ",SPOCK
Are you sure the mutation wasn't somehow accomplished naturally? ,KIRK
Plot an extended orbit to clear disturbance. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Well, thank you. Mind if I look around a bit? (checking the bottles) Crude, but very useable. ",MCCOY
"Not all of us, Bones. When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take. ",KIRK
Mister Spock? Find something? ,KIRK
"Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for. ",KIRK
Of course. ,KIRK
"Read out, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy? ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. ,KIRK
I shall endeavour to keep it under control. ,SPOCK
Go to full magnification. ,KIRK
We need only a few hours. ,KIRK
Am I behaving incorrectly? ,KIRK
McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.,MCCOY
My shoes are full of sand. ,MCCOY
"The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike.",KIRK
Are you sure? ,KIRK
"I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole. ",SPOCK
"The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock crystals, Doctor, until they attack. ",SPOCK
"Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake. Once that has been completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the authorities. You can make your case to them. ",KIRK
"This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark.",SPOCK
I think I understand. You said it. Pity is the worst of all. ,KIRK
"A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field. ",SPOCK
"I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable. ",KIRK
"It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love. ",SPOCK
What about the Federation science team working there? Doctor Manway had a special transmitter. ,KIRK
"He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you volunteered to go. What is that thing out there, Bones? It's not intelligent. Not yet. ",KIRK
"Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due. ",SPOCK
Are we still in contact with the probe? ,KIRK
Slaughter? Hundreds of people? ,MCCOY
Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the others. I was the one who shot out your mirror machine. ,KIRK
"Well, Scotty, now you've done it. ",MCCOY
We have a witness in McCoy's behalf. You must trust me. ,SPOCK
Let's find out where we stand. Computer. ,KIRK
"Let us remove the instrument of obedience, the way we did for McCoy. Natira. ",KIRK
"Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu? ",SPOCK
"We don't actually understand it ourselves, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"No. I just removed these for examination. His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system. ",MCCOY
How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target? ,KIRK
"Jim, you ordered us? You had no authority! ",MCCOY
"If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two. ",MCCOY
Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts. ,SPOCK
I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip. ,SPOCK
"What happened to your ship, Matt? ",KIRK
"If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes.",SPOCK
Commander.,KIRK
I never felt anything like that. Every nerve in my body was on fire. ,KIRK
The desperation of the science ship's first landing party is now obvious. ,SPOCK
"The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is it? ",SPOCK
"Bones, can you tell me what they all died of?",KIRK
We'd better pick up our pace. There's no place for cover if we meet any other creatures. The bearing on the signal we heard is that way. ,KIRK
"Negative, Captain. ",SPOCK
"It does, Captain. ",MCCOY
So improbable we almost didn't check it. ,MCCOY
"Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store.  ",KIRK
"Captain! (Kirk wakes) Jim, what is it? What have they done to you? ",MCCOY
"The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. ",KIRK
Where's Doctor McCoy? ,SPOCK
"Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock. It's an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient, does too much work for you. ",KIRK
He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous. ,SPOCK
The gun. Ammunition. Doctor. ,KIRK
"Yes, I'm fine, Bones. ",KIRK
"Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture. Kirk to Spock. ",KIRK
Thank you. So are yours. ,KIRK
I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner. ,SPOCK
That's true. ,MCCOY
I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm picking up life readings. Spock out.,SPOCK
"Evasive maneuvers, Mister Sulu.",SPOCK
"Thank you, Captain. (draws a phaser) We're now armed. I presume we shall try to reach the control room. ",SPOCK
"I don't want a prediction. You will start work immediately, around the clock, nonstop, until you arrive at a formula that gets us out of here. ",KIRK
Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that direction. ,SPOCK
"What every ship Captain knows. General Order 7, no vessel under any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four. ",KIRK
"Jim, you don't think that's going to help us? Whatever that thing is, it survived millennia in a dead hulk. All it has to do is outlast us and just take over. ",MCCOY
"You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go. ",SPOCK
Will you require assistance here? ,SPOCK
"Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I hope your computations are correct, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Go on. Finish. Ben was a friend of yours, and  MCCOY: Jim. ",KIRK
"It will take a lot longer than that, Commander. ",KIRK
You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you. ,SPOCK
"All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security detail. ",KIRK
Put it on. ,KIRK
All right. Let's go. ,KIRK
Any other logical candidate? ,KIRK
Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude. ,SPOCK
How many of those did you beam up? ,KIRK
"The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did. ",SPOCK
"Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure worked. The vent is closed. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott and I will stay here, but beam the damage control party aboard. ",KIRK
"Who threw the first punch, Scotty? ",KIRK
Go to GQ four. ,KIRK
Where is here? ,KIRK
"You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her. ",KIRK
"One specimen, you said. One specimen! What happened to my men? ",KIRK
"Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Their war, Mister Stiles. Not yours. Don't forget it. ",KIRK
This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere. Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack. ,SPOCK
How did you escape? ,KIRK
I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for life. ,SPOCK
Phasers on stun! ,KIRK
Who could have done such a thing? ,KIRK
Is Kor's office down there? ,KIRK
Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status? ,MCCOY
"I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you aboard the Enterprise. Why would I do that if I didn't like you? ",KIRK
Activate warp drive! ,KIRK
"A race of mutes, like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis Four. ",KIRK
"After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost the picture the Metron was sending us.",SPOCK
A changeling. ,KIRK
Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics. ,SPOCK
Have you reversed controls? ,SPOCK
"And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too? ",KIRK
What was it? ,SPOCK
"If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat. ",SPOCK
It should for a while. ,MCCOY
(sound in the closet) Come out. We mean you no harm. (opens door),KIRK
Completed. ,MCCOY
Are You certain about the time we have left? ,KIRK
"We must get our communicators, contact the ship. ",KIRK
"Remember, Trelane. You promised to let my ship go. ",KIRK
"Good. Nurse, how is he? ",KIRK
It tastes just fine. ,MCCOY
Mister Spock? ,KIRK
Then watch him. Hang on to being a human for one minute longer. ,KIRK
That's right. ,MCCOY
"I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them. ",MCCOY
No? ,KIRK
We believe it can be done. ,KIRK
"Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. You, bartender. Ed. You, er, you claim you know us. ",KIRK
Air sample?,KIRK
"I believe there is, Captain. But not within me. I sensed something strange about the Klingons when we were aboard the Klothos.",SPOCK
And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. ,SPOCK
"Put phasers on standby, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay. Mister Spock, take the ship out of orbit. Resume designated course.",KIRK
"That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical. ",SPOCK
Spock said that? ,KIRK
We discussed that possibility earlier. But you will need this information. ,SPOCK
"That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo. ",KIRK
Who? ,KIRK
Explain computer activity in the engineering section. ,SPOCK
"Come on, Bones.",KIRK
You'll never get off the ship.,KIRK
"Life prolongation. Didn't have much luck, did they?",MCCOY
"Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning. ",SPOCK
"Move in closely, Mister Chekov. Sublight one quarter speed. ",KIRK
How long has it been? ,KIRK
"On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey.",KIRK
The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour. ,KIRK
Occasional and teenage routine incidents. ,MCCOY
"Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship. ",KIRK
Ambassador. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, I've spoken to Winston on this at some length. He has assured me it is absolutely vital to get to Ratar Three in the shortest possible time. The survival of the entire planetary population may depend on it. ",KIRK
"I'll take the conn, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Let's prepare to close. Nurse! ,MCCOY
Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command. ,KIRK
I agree. I waited until the last possible moment. We were on Red Alert. The storm got worse. I had to jettison the pod. ,KIRK
"We mean you no harm. We're not your enemies, we're your friends.",KIRK
"I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference. ",SPOCK
"Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body. ",KIRK
He's passed us. All shields held. ,SPOCK
"I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings. ",KIRK
I shall give it top priority. ,SPOCK
"If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source. (raises his voice) Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen. After all, his actions are those of an immature, unbalanced mind. ",KIRK
"Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec. Status, legal ward after the death of her parents. ",KIRK
His name was Adam. ,SPOCK
"It's your idea, Doctor. Go ahead. ",KIRK
Negative. ,SPOCK
I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt. ,SPOCK
"(with an extreme southern drawl) Ready to beam up. Hiya, Jimmy boy! Hey, I've taken care of everything. All y'all gotta do is relax.",MCCOY
"Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing. ",MCCOY
Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake.,KIRK
There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand. ,SPOCK
Yeah. ,KIRK
I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer.,SPOCK
"Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy. ",SPOCK
"Shut up. (to Kirk) Shh. Shh! (to camera) Well, what do you know?",MCCOY
"All right, my recommendations are as follows. We send down general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet's surface. The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer Spock. ",KIRK
My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor. ,MCCOY
You were what? ,KIRK
They're not responding. ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he needs our help. ",KIRK
"Under present conditions, extremely poor. ",SPOCK
"We're moving, the Enterprise isn't. Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go. If I only had some phasers. ",KIRK
"I don't insist, Jim, but I can't dismiss the possibility. ",MCCOY
"All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil, ancient terror. ",KIRK
Do your best. ,KIRK
It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No standard references apply. ,SPOCK
I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago. ,SPOCK
Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome.,KIRK
Yeah. ,MCCOY
"Up there. Outside, up there, everywhere. ",KIRK
"Verbose, isn't he? ",SPOCK
Only one. Tomlinson. The boy who was getting married this morning. His fiancée is at the chapel. ,MCCOY
I call Lucien as my first witness. ,SPOCK
Security guards to the Bridge. ,SPOCK
Would you rather stay here? ,SPOCK
"I hate to be a pessimist, but that may not be as easy as you think. ",MCCOY
"Spock, are you all right? ",KIRK
Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? ,KIRK
"I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell. ",KIRK
"This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're inside, somewhere. ",SPOCK
Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.,KIRK
"Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be done.",SPOCK
"No, they cannot. Or rather, will not. ",SPOCK
(answers comm. beep) Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Yes. Mister Sulu, release the helm to Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura. ,KIRK
I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining. ,KIRK
"In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you. ",SPOCK
Deflectors full intensity. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Follow me. ,KIRK
No doubt. ,KIRK
"Report, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Your weight was up a couple of pounds, remember?",MCCOY
Why does he need the crystals? For what reason? ,SPOCK
"Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask that question.",SPOCK
It should be possible to filter out the human factors. ,SPOCK
"Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that? ",KIRK
Set.,KIRK
You've just suggested something that never occurred to me. It may provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor McCoy is looking at this very moment. ,KIRK
I can't kill them! I can't kill them! ,KIRK
Exactly. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any objections? ,KIRK
Kirk out. What is it? ,KIRK
"Miranda, I meant no insult. Please. Here we are among the roses.",KIRK
My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters.,KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Go. ,KIRK
"There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?",SPOCK
"Understood, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the best first officer in the fleet. ",MCCOY
"My guess is she needs more. You want it, Nancy? Come and get it. ",KIRK
"On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four and six. Widest possible scatter. ",KIRK
You saved my life down there. I want to thank you. ,KIRK
The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory. ,SPOCK
Very clever. As to the reason? ,SPOCK
Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? Robes. ,KIRK
"I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Many ways? What else does she know about us? ,MCCOY
Where are they? ,KIRK
You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris? ,KIRK
What's their impression of us? ,MCCOY
Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating? ,KIRK
My own concern is more immediate. The boy. ,SPOCK
"You were actually enjoying my predicament back there. At times, you seem quite human. ",KIRK
"Spock, I remember. When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other, for an instant we were one. I know him now. I know what he is and what he wants, and I don't fear him. ",KIRK
And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you. ,KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator. ,KIRK
Auxiliaries? ,KIRK
"I have checked the supplies, Captain. As expected, they are adequate and there are weapons. ",SPOCK
"Spock, evaluation? ",KIRK
"Thank you, Doctor. (the lights come back on) Report, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"She is an alien. The configurations of her brain are different. It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level. ",SPOCK
That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. All right.,KIRK
"Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mister Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship. Stand by communications. Mister Spock. If you don't receive a message from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once. No turning back. ",KIRK
"Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately, there. That is, of course, a crude estimation. ",SPOCK
"We will notify her as soon as we've verified your credentials, Mister Winston. If you have your identity tapes with you  MCCOY: Spock! Of all the cold-blooded, inhospitable requests I've ever heard. ",SPOCK
"I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please. ",SPOCK
I don't know. ,SPOCK
Thank you. ,MCCOY
"Come in, Spock. ",KIRK
Who are you? ,KIRK
"Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First Officer Spock in command. The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours. Computer probability projections are useless due to insufficient data.",SPOCK

"Give me a damage report as soon as possible, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?_ GARROVICK: Dikironium reading now, sir. Bearing ninety four mark seven, angle of elevation six degrees. Holding steady. ",KIRK
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK

"Mister Spock, whatever we're dealing with, I don't think we can bribe it. We must be honest. Kirk to alien intelligence. I don't think it's strong enough to be noticeable. ",KIRK
"You take a lot of chances, Councilman. ",KIRK
Play it. ,KIRK
"You were a little hard on the boy, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Quite ready, Captain. ",SPOCK
Explain. ,KIRK
Those were all acts carried out by our attacker. ,KIRK
That's enough for today. Those two are beginning to affect you. ,KIRK
Captain Kirk to all ship personnel. Red Alert. An attempt was made to murder Ambassador Kollos. The murderer is dangerously insane. He is Lawrence Marvick. Be on the watch for him. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Mine too, Jim. ",MCCOY
"(into intercom) Mister Scott, I'll need all the speed you can deliver. Keep at it until we begin to shake apart. Kirk out. I believe I know where it's going. ",KIRK
"No use, Captain. Some sort of interference has been set up. ",SPOCK
"Since we must have our captain back, I accept. ",SPOCK
"Your reaction, One of recognition. ",SPOCK
"Last week with you, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Ambassador, there's an added complication. The Federation High Commissioner will be attending the wedding. ",KIRK
"Answer him, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
Beam us aboard.,KIRK
Now you're beginning to make sense. ,MCCOY
"It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient? ",KIRK
Does Maab know that the Klingons are our sworn enemies by their own words? ,MCCOY
I didn't think you'd even talk to me. ,KIRK
"The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out. We're barely surviving at this distance. ",KIRK
"And that irritates you, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
I don't know what you are but you're not a woman. You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them. You ask for love and return pain instead. ,KIRK
"You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it communicate with you? ",SPOCK
Well? ,KIRK
I can't? ,KIRK
Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus colony.,KIRK
"Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it. ",SPOCK
Hit on the Lexington. ,SPOCK
"Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is  MCCOY: No! Now. Right away. If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week eight days at the outside, he'll die. He'll die, Jim. ",KIRK
"Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion. ",SPOCK
She called it a Borgia plant. ,MCCOY
"I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory. ",SPOCK
Are you sure? ,KIRK
"Greetings, Mister Advisor. ",SPOCK
Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard? ,MCCOY
Love to teach it to you.,MCCOY
Bones. Scotty. Spock's brain controls  MCCOY: It's not possible. ,KIRK
It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete. ,MCCOY
I would like to have met Doctor Adams. Have you ever been to a penal colony since they started following his theories?,KIRK
"The photon torpedoes will not respond, either. The stasis field disables all higher-order field and warp functions. ",SPOCK
Are you mad? I can't just  [Bridge],KIRK
"Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard. ",KIRK
I know. ,KIRK
"This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you? ",SPOCK
Nerve tissue. Mass density is exceptionally high. Readings indicate the beings used almost seventy percent of their brains. A very high ratio. ,SPOCK
"Strange, that's the way I feel about you, too. My dear friend, Spock. Come, let's go get Mudd and Christine. ",KIRK
There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement?,KIRK
"I'm very well aware of that, Lieutenant. Try it. ",KIRK
"Yes, yes, that sounds likely. ",KIRK
"The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock? You've got a a good bedside manner, Spock. ",MCCOY
"No, you'll live and develop as you should have. All this shouldn't have been done for you. Now the women here below and the men here above will control together. ",KIRK
Then what was? Winston. ,KIRK
Sir? ,SPOCK
"And if we fight them, we all die. We know that. ",MCCOY
"We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the Captain alive. ",SPOCK
I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. ,SPOCK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
"No, sir. An unidentifiable power. ",SPOCK
But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived?,KIRK
For the moment. ,SPOCK
There are many things in our galaxy like the one you just perceived. ,SPOCK
"This is Doctor McCoy, our Chief Medical Officer. Daras, secretary to the National Socialist Party. ",KIRK
We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe. ,KIRK
There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures. ,MCCOY
"Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering. ",SPOCK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
There's something I need to tell you. ,MCCOY
"Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? Get them all. ",KIRK
Except a challenge. ,KIRK
You could go. We're willing to take passengers. ,KIRK
"Can you explain that, Doctor? ",KIRK
"She's not Nancy, Bones.",KIRK
"Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition? ",KIRK
The others? ,KIRK
How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries we estimate.,KIRK
Not without my First Officer. ,KIRK
And transport Mister Spock and myself immediately. ,KIRK
Get into direct mental contact with that thing? ,KIRK
"Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him. ",SPOCK
Can you bridge to your setup? ,KIRK
Library computer. ,KIRK
"I think I read you, Jim, but as medical officer I must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children, you are treading dangerously. ",MCCOY
Maybe the planet smells a trick. ,MCCOY
"Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is. ",KIRK
Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking place on this planet for at least several centuries. ,SPOCK
"Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests. ",KIRK
Captain to Bridge. ,KIRK
Out of the nowhere into the here. ,KIRK
"Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.",SPOCK
"It looks like ancient Earth, Spock. Sixteenth or seventeenth century, I'd guess. ",KIRK
"What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion? ",MCCOY
Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard. ,KIRK
We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet.,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to mass suicide. ",KIRK
Well? ,MCCOY
Did you say it hovered? ,KIRK
All right. ,KIRK
I suspected he might not wish to return with us. ,SPOCK
"Good. Then it's safe for us to beam down to Dramia Two. Shall we, gentlemen? ",KIRK
They're running away. Very odd. They did not use their stasis weapon at all. ,SPOCK
Probably kill Jim and Spock. ,MCCOY
This is real grass. ,MCCOY
Meaning she's quite a woman. I agree. ,KIRK
"They are beings. Alive, like you. They will all die if you consume that thing. ",SPOCK
Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device? ,SPOCK
"Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov. ",SPOCK
Scotty? ,KIRK
Seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning.,KIRK
"And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your phaser? That is still Jim's body. ",SPOCK
If we stay. ,SPOCK
"What do you read, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
After that? ,MCCOY
Why? ,MCCOY
"You found no intelligent life forms, Mister Spock, but surely  SPOCK: The asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old, Doctor. Still no sign of life forms, Captain. ",MCCOY
Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.,SPOCK
"Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get that heater down. Don't you want to take a look at what you're going to fight? ",KIRK
"Well, well, well. It is our worship word, too. ",KIRK
That would give a mechanical reading. I'm getting nothing. ,MCCOY
"Yes. Your time is running out. This sun is about to nova. When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet, and this insane torture chamber. ",KIRK
Let's get them while we are. Before we enter the Neutral Zone.,KIRK
"I don't believe it, Spock. It's just not like you to give up trying. ",MCCOY
"Captain, you're not beaming down. ",MCCOY
"You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll. Try that. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant, there's nothing there. ",KIRK
"Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital? ",MCCOY
We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't? ,KIRK
"(on floor) He's right, Spock. You must shoot, but shoot both of us. It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"There's a chance it may work, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it. ",SPOCK
"I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe. ",SPOCK
"I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you with them to Triacus. So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time. That would make them very unhappy and miss you. I'm sure that you would miss them, too. ",KIRK
Atmospheric controls cut off. ,KIRK
I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two. ,KIRK
That should be enough time. Let's get at it. ,KIRK
"If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him could be dangerous. ",SPOCK
"They're fine, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards.",SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
"I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure. ",SPOCK
There is no third planet. ,KIRK
Run. We've got to find some light. We can't do anything unless we can see what we're fighting. Don't stop. Try to stay together. ,KIRK
And came here to swindle honest miners. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, outfit a landing party. We're beaming down with some questions.",KIRK
"We could not leave one of our own behind. It is our responsibility to take care of our own, just as it is your responsibility to take care of yours. We could not leave him here where he might further interfere with your, your children. ",KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"At that rate, it will take exactly seventy four point one solar hours for the storm to pass. ",SPOCK
It's Klingon. Bones? ,KIRK
Obviously. ,SPOCK
"Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves.",KIRK
"Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will help us. ",SPOCK
"Spock, how small will we ultimately shrink? ",KIRK
"You could use some sleep, Bones. ",KIRK
"The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship. ",SPOCK
"The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard. ",SPOCK
"I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain. ",SPOCK
It occurred. I dismissed it. ,SPOCK
But we are going to Scalos? ,KIRK
Getting a reading? ,KIRK
"Come on, Boma. ",SPOCK
"There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense. ",SPOCK
"I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, Doctor. ",KIRK
"If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mister Flint if necessary. ",KIRK
You are not jealous? ,SPOCK
Tranquilliser? ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
I would like  NONA: Happy. Yes. You feel good. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain. ",KIRK
"Young man, run along and play. ",KIRK
Mudd? ,SPOCK
Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get. Detonator. ,KIRK
Continue. ,SPOCK
"No, but the method is fascinating. ",SPOCK
"The strands wouldn't break, Jim, they'd just quit winding. ",MCCOY
It's re-rigged. Hurry. ,SPOCK
"That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain. ",MCCOY
Scotty doesn't believe in gods. ,MCCOY
Set directional controls for Starbase Four.,KIRK
"Engine room, we need power!",SPOCK
Goodbye Deela.  ,KIRK
"Scotty, Scotty. In Argelius they use the lights. ",KIRK
Then you knew you were a carrier. ,SPOCK
"Alien bodies, Bones? ",KIRK
Has the Ambassador been hurt? ,KIRK
Kirk to Security. ,KIRK
That's a pretty far out story. ,MCCOY
Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale. ,SPOCK
Compton! ,MCCOY
"So help me, if you don't tell me where Spock has been taken  OTHERS: The Master. Praise to the Master. The Master, our Saviour.",KIRK
Mister Spock! Something's happening outside. ,MCCOY
Now he tells me. ,KIRK
"They're answering. (static) Did you get a fix on that, Jim? ",MCCOY
Yes? ,MCCOY
Get her to Sickbay at once. ,KIRK
Bones. ,KIRK
"What do you care as long as you're being cut in? Course, there's always Bela Oxmyx. ",KIRK
"Anything, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
"Scotty, take it easy. ",KIRK
Mister Sulu. ,KIRK
Possible. I would have to have one to examine. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant. All our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you. ",KIRK
"Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double. ",KIRK
"Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive? ",MCCOY
"All right, let's try that one again. Go! ",KIRK
Got it. Sord. ,KIRK
You mean yet. ,MCCOY
Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the possibility. ,SPOCK
Positive. ,SPOCK
Why? ,KIRK
Cardio-stimulate. ,MCCOY
"Jim, Spock. ",MCCOY
He'll do it. ,SPOCK
"Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent.",KIRK
"Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel. ",SPOCK
"It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter. I should advise caution. ",SPOCK
(hoarse) Yes. Doctor McCoy. ,SPOCK
Would be? You mean you think they're fakes? ,KIRK
"Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close. ",SPOCK
Do it. Kirk out. ,KIRK
Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original bodies when we beamed down to the planet. ,SPOCK
"Rila, this is my engineering officer, Mister Scott. Tribune Rila is an Aquan. Their city is a short distance away. ",KIRK
I'm the Captain. ,KIRK
Give me the phone. ,KIRK
"What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity. ",SPOCK
"Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it out) Perhaps everything. ",SPOCK
Vulcan. Miss Chapel. ,SPOCK
"Problem, Captain?",SPOCK
"Exceptionally strong contact. Not visual yet. Distant spectrograph. Metallic, similar to cube. Much greater energy reading.",SPOCK
Time until explosion? ,KIRK
"Stay on it, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Bones, what do you make of it? ",KIRK
"Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human. ",MCCOY
Misleading the innocent? I wonder. ,KIRK
"Do you agree with it, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"Darling, are you all right? ",SPOCK
"Bones, the worst thing you can do to a practical joker is to play a practical joke on them. ",KIRK
Spock? ,KIRK
"With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy. ",SPOCK
Precisely. ,SPOCK
"Hard to port, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"This hearing is now in session. Under the authority vested in me by Starfleet Command, I declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped. ",KIRK
"You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan! ",MCCOY
"Thank you, Doctor. (drinks) That's one of your better prescriptions. ",KIRK
All right. Work on Bones. See if you can't  LAWGIVER: Come. ,KIRK
"I'm fine, Bones. The cat's last power jolt clipped me. ",KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
Over here. Over here.,MCCOY
"Annoyed, Spock? ",KIRK
"(looking up a Jefferies tube) Say, you didn't get this one, Bones. ",KIRK
"Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes.",KIRK
"Go on, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately.",MCCOY
Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period. ,SPOCK
Sounds most promising. Good luck. ,KIRK
"He means when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Bones. (starts to collapse.) No, no, I'm all right  (McCoy helps him onto a bed.) ",KIRK
"Anything further, gentlemen?",KIRK
The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline. I presume you've ordered full duration. ,SPOCK
He never mentioned that his family was this important. ,KIRK
An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about. ,KIRK
Energise. ,KIRK
"I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor. ",SPOCK
The answer is no. ,MCCOY
"But someday, you will want human love and companionship. ",KIRK
You could. A while ago it was child's play.,KIRK
We'll continue our search. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Riley's gone. I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos.,MCCOY
"The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry would be quite efficacious. ",SPOCK
Larry Marvick? Why? ,KIRK
You poor girl. ,MCCOY
Astronomical section reports that a comet recently passed by.,KIRK
"Bones, how is he? ",KIRK
You're going back with us. ,KIRK
Those are undesirable qualities. ,KIRK
"Keep him alive, Bones. I want to know what's been happening here.",KIRK
Bones. I had the strangest dream. ,KIRK
"If you don't mind, I'd rather walk. ",KIRK
I'd forgotten. ,KIRK
"Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts? ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"The human small intestine is lined with millions of them, to absorb nutrients into the body. ",MCCOY
"Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock.",KIRK
Do these waves cease while you are asleep? ,SPOCK
"There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock. Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment. ",KIRK
"Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come. As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive. We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear. ",KIRK
"The sensors don't indicate any life forms down there, aside from fish. ",MCCOY
It's still no deal. ,KIRK
Yes. ,MCCOY
"It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. ",SPOCK
I wonder what makes it do that.,MCCOY
"Having trouble, gentlemen?",KIRK
Eight seven five. ,SPOCK
"There's your murder charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It's killing men and women. Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women! ",KIRK
"It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later. ",KIRK
Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise. ,SPOCK
Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio. ,SPOCK
Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course. ,SPOCK
"The boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon, does he not? ",SPOCK
"True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned. ",SPOCK
In addition you've caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that's been negotiated between your planet and the Federation. ,KIRK
Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier.,MCCOY
Answer me. ,KIRK
"That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one. ",KIRK
"This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking out phenomenon? ",KIRK
"Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us, we will lose Spock. ",MCCOY
"Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is extremely sorry. ",MCCOY
"The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging. ",SPOCK
"What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid. ",KIRK
Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel. ,SPOCK
Against whom? ,KIRK
Doc. Sorry.,KIRK
"Who's he, Jim? ",MCCOY
"Standing by, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door. ",SPOCK
"You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do. ",KIRK
"Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach. What is it, exactly?",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy. ",KIRK
"Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years. ",SPOCK
That might not be easy should Parmen die. ,KIRK
"There are other ways. You'll discover them. You must move to the surface, you understand. ",KIRK
"It is my time to waste, Ambassador. ",MCCOY
"Is that how you get girls to like you, by bribing them? There doesn't seem to be anybody around, does there. ",MCCOY
No. ,KIRK
An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field. ,SPOCK
I almost married her! ,KIRK
"I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty? ",KIRK
Ten feet away from me. ,KIRK
"Yes, I know. ",KIRK
Peter? ,KIRK
"Re-scan your sensor readings, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
We've got helm and navigational control. Turn us about. Have Mister Chekov plot a course back to the space station.,KIRK
"Man your post, Mister. If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid. ",KIRK
"It is, Captain. ",SPOCK
Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man and a woman. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, I want a twenty four hour regressive memory check made on Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"Bring him aboard, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
Ready. ,KIRK
"Captain, what about the people on the planet? ",SPOCK
"Even if we could, it's out of the question. We need that projector to bring our people back to human form. ",KIRK
Kirk to Security. What's the status on the search for the Vendorian? ,KIRK
"There are none after it's refined. But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it releases a violent reaction. ",MCCOY
Location and distance. ,KIRK
Me? What are you talking about? ,MCCOY
Open your mouth. ,MCCOY
Of course it does. Maybe it is the same. ,KIRK
Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything. ,KIRK
Jim! ,MCCOY
Good evening.,KIRK
Just what the doctor ordered. ,MCCOY
But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. ,SPOCK
I don't know. Green! (Green arrives) Did you see this? ,KIRK
What is it? What's wrong? ,MCCOY
"Yes. Duties. That's it. Duties. I have  THEELA: You cannot leave, Mister Spock. You are needed here. Soon, all the men on your ship will feel as you do. They are all needed, and they will join us. ",KIRK
"No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we doing? ",MCCOY
"You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make? ",SPOCK
"You could have selected a more convenient place, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Your name, please. ",KIRK
"I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to bring me along. ",SPOCK
I won't hurt you. ,KIRK
"No, not yet. ",MCCOY
I see. Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface.,KIRK
Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen. ,KIRK
"Oh, yes it does, Spock. (further along) Keep concentrating, Spock. Keep concentrating, Spock. ",KIRK
"It would appear that the Enterprise is the target, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Full power to the shields, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen. I've got to find out what's happening out there. ",KIRK
I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power. ,MCCOY
"Yes. Status report on the damaged grain ship, Scotty? ",KIRK
"I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a landing party may be necessary. ",SPOCK
"I'll say. Spock, this is  SPOCK: Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir? ",KIRK
"Well, either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning, and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty. ",MCCOY
"Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the distress signal is automated. ",SPOCK
"No, I don't. Won't you tell me? ",KIRK
"Source of radiation, Captain. ",SPOCK
The play is over. It's been over for twenty years. ,KIRK
"What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in the library. In the library.",KIRK
"Lieutenant, get Daystrom up here. Disengaging M-5 unit. Cut speed to warp one. Navigator, go to course one one three mark seven. I want that ship given a wide berth. ",KIRK
"Captain, please go. Somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable  [McCoy's office]",SPOCK
Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel. ,SPOCK
"What's your attitude on that, Doctor? ",MCCOY
"Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging. ",MCCOY
Prepare to beam down to the planet surface fast. ,KIRK
Our direction is indicated. ,SPOCK
Your Excellency. ,KIRK
Why not? I saw your performance today. May I extend my appreciation? ,KIRK
"Captain, signs pointing the way. ",SPOCK
Then run it twenty times if that's what it takes!,KIRK
"The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons.",KIRK
"You know as much as I do, Bones. ",KIRK
You mean to tell me you've called me three light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being Kodos? ,KIRK
"Twenty two so far. Mainly radiation burns, mostly from the ship's outer areas. Could have been much, much worse, Captain. ",MCCOY
It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it. ,SPOCK
"If we don't accept his invitation, we'll have a crushed eggshell where this ship used to be. ",KIRK
It seems to be. ,KIRK
"We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours. ",SPOCK
"And if he's coming apart, Jim, we're in serious trouble. Getting out of here hinges on his computations. ",MCCOY
"Also make quite a weapon. Steady as she goes, Sulu. ",KIRK
"How do you feel, Jim? ",MCCOY
"It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we're to provide Starfleet with an accurate report. Lieutenant, send Doctor McCoy to the transporter room for survey party. We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato. ",KIRK
"These are a proud people. They have their own customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them. It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law. Is that clear? ",KIRK
Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? ,MCCOY
"Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in. ",KIRK
Do it. ,KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing? ,MCCOY
"Standard ion type, Captain, but quite violent (Enterprise shakes) and unpredictable. ",SPOCK
It worked in a lab. With the creature exposed to everything we can give it. But what about the people who are infected? ,KIRK
What have you done with Spock's brain? Where've you taken it? ,KIRK
Doctor. ,SPOCK
"They appear to be drugged, Jim. Look at their eyes. Hardly blink at all. ",MCCOY
"Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim. ",MCCOY
Someone tried to poison him. ,SPOCK
I suppose you're right. ,MCCOY
I was looking over some material about their Ice Age. ,MCCOY
"Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon. A silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order. It's possible that our phasers might not affect it. ",KIRK
"Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is pursing an independent course through this solar system. ",SPOCK
Survivors?,KIRK
"You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on.",KIRK
Is it on the alien's course?,KIRK
"That head injury. Think, Scotty. ",KIRK
Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council. ,SPOCK
Hmm? ,MCCOY
"Harry, do you have any of the crystals left? ",KIRK
"As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber. ",SPOCK
"Approaching the life-form, Captain. ",SPOCK
But not totally unexpected. ,SPOCK
"Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you? ",KIRK
Captain. Tools for finely detailed work. ,SPOCK
"Transporter, stand by. ",SPOCK
No! We can't! ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal speed. ",KIRK
"Why, thank you. Ambassador. ",KIRK
"He's maintaining that bearing, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Bones, he's the cloud. Its thoughts are here. Don't move.",KIRK
One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing. ,MCCOY
"Mister Scott, I understand your concern over her, but she volunteered to go with him, hopefully to find out more about him. She's doing her job. I think it's about time you started doing yours. We've got to find out the source of his power. You've got a tricorder. Use it if you're able to. ",KIRK
I'll take the one on the left. Fire. ,KIRK
But there is earth-type vegetation. ,KIRK
Do you think I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since  SPOCK: The Vulcans saw it first and died. ,MCCOY
Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy. ,SPOCK
Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now. ,KIRK
"A serious breach of orders, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Spock, do you see any hope that these Yangs can be reasoned with?",KIRK
"Yes, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"Yes, here. Not our universe, not our ship. Something parallel. A parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane.",KIRK
"All right, Chief, begin materialisation.",KIRK
"Ready to beam up, Jim. ",SPOCK
"Oh, so you're the dentist. Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency. I wonder if you mind if I borrow a small quantity of this. ",MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, lay in a course for Cepheus. ",KIRK
Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour.,SPOCK
"Sure, Bones, what? ",KIRK
"No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason. ",SPOCK
Are you that anxious to die? ,KIRK
It's an awesome thought that we may actually witness matter being created. ,KIRK
I told you to stay in Sickbay. ,KIRK
I'll certify that right now. ,MCCOY
That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae. ,SPOCK
Any sign of survivors? ,KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
Can you help it? ,KIRK
"I'll be guided by that opinion, Doctor, for the present. What about questioning them? ",KIRK
"You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too.",KIRK
"I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent. ",SPOCK
Enterprise. ,MCCOY
Terraforming isn't new. It implies intelligent life forms. ,MCCOY
"Yes. If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference. ",KIRK
"Tractor beam? How do we do that, Spock? ",KIRK
"Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock. I want it. Marple, cut around the rock to your right.",KIRK
"What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
"I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?",KIRK
"Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans.",KIRK
I don't want to say goodbye. ,KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Our orders are very clear. We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, what's our orbit status? ",KIRK
"Either way, Mister Spock, it will hardly be our problem. ",KIRK
"Stand by to get out of there, Ben. ",KIRK
"Mister Walking Bear, how  KUKULKAN [OC]: I was angered because I believed you had forgotten me.",KIRK
They won't hurt you.,KIRK
I'd be admitting a man died because  STONE: Admit nothing. Say nothing. Let me bury the matter here and now.,KIRK
But we cannot expect their co-operation. They have refused the Empire. Command procedure dictates that we provide the customary example. ,SPOCK
"The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences.",SPOCK
Thank you. ,SPOCK
Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system. ,SPOCK
"Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon. ",SPOCK
"Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent  SPOCK: No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan. ",KIRK
Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has only been aboard seventy two hours. ,SPOCK
"That's true, Captain. ",SPOCK
That's exactly what I was going to ask.,KIRK
"This is where they live. They digest rock, they tunnel for nourishment. ",KIRK
Thank you. Mister Sulu? ,KIRK
Sulu? ,KIRK
Fire. ,KIRK
Energise. ,KIRK
"We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be done. ",MCCOY
"Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan. ",MCCOY
"Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary. ",SPOCK
"I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and peaceful culture. ",MCCOY
"I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a picture of their Bridge. ",SPOCK
"If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now. Is that clear? ",KIRK
"He's dying, and I can't stop it. ",MCCOY
Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them. ,SPOCK
Never mind that. We've got to get Spock out of here before Keniclius returns. Scott should have the Enterprise back by now. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Nothing. Must be these blasted walls again. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
I certainly think that science might provide an answer. ,KIRK
He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research station. ,KIRK
Mister Scott is still with us. ,KIRK
Make course for Starbase Twelve. ,KIRK
"Sho'nuf. Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh? ",MCCOY
The delta rays?,MCCOY
There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help. ,KIRK
The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack. Bring the ship about now. If you bring her about  [Bridge],KIRK
"Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further. ",SPOCK
All perfectly normal. Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else. ,MCCOY
"We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, Commissioner. ",KIRK
Phasers. ,KIRK
"Yes, Commissioner, all of them. ",KIRK
We found a cure. We're over that part of it. ,MCCOY
You must get us in there. ,KIRK
"How is he, Doctor? ",SPOCK
And no doubt they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for ten thousand years. ,SPOCK
My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine. ,KIRK
If the energy stays at that level. ,SPOCK
"It seems to have some sort of anatomy. Arex, where are we on that chart? ",KIRK
"No, Jim. No indication of any kind. ",MCCOY
Anything at all? ,KIRK
The result is suffocation. ,KIRK
"What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut? ,SPOCK
"Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point. ",MCCOY
"It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays.",SPOCK
"From that ship. She took it. I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it. Bones, how long can you keep him functioning? ",KIRK
One. A naturally occurring drug called strobolin. But it's only found on a few planets in the galaxy. ,MCCOY
Keep checking. ,KIRK
You won't have long to wait. ,KIRK
Who are the inhabitants of this planet? ,KIRK
Wife? ,MCCOY
"Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course. ",SPOCK
What has that got  AMANDA: You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to your father. ,MCCOY
"We're locked onto the Exeter's engineering section, Captain. ",SPOCK
Thank God. ,MCCOY
Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem. ,KIRK
Finished. ,MCCOY
Let us take you with us to a place of safety. ,KIRK
Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life. ,SPOCK
Saurian brandy. ,KIRK
Probably that nectar. It's potent as Saurian brandy. ,MCCOY
"It won't die. By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day. ",MCCOY
Energise! ,KIRK
"No. No, if I'd be useful, as long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is. ",MCCOY
"Lock phasers on target. Mister Bailey, lock phasers. ",KIRK
"There's some resemblance. I don't know how much we can depend on it. But I'll tell you one thing. We have to get out of this area. Those mists out there are acting something like a macromorphase enzyme. If the shields don't stay up, the hull will be corroded and we'll all be broken down into nice digestible particles. ",MCCOY
A reasonable course. ,SPOCK
Fuel consumption report? ,KIRK
Scotty. (picks up the twisted and melted weapon) Very impressive.,KIRK
"Then, what happened? ",KIRK
"Bones, you've got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit. Give me one. ",KIRK
What the blazes is going on? ,KIRK
What do you mean just there? ,KIRK
Possible. Very possible. ,SPOCK
"Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive? ",KIRK
There's something under the skin. (a red light goes out) He's dead. ,MCCOY
How fast? ,KIRK
"But they weren't rivals in love. Jim, you shouldn't go in there.",MCCOY
Let's take a look inside. ,KIRK
"If it's fighting that you want, (slaps Trelane) you may have it. ",KIRK
As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level. ,SPOCK
All things die. ,KIRK
"Contact check, Captain. It has been over an hour since your last communication. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura. This may be crucial. In the presence of the Kzinti, do not say anything, do not do anything startling. Try to look harmless. ",SPOCK
Bones? ,KIRK
Thank you. ,MCCOY
"Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions. ",SPOCK
"And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out. ",SPOCK
"You're behind the times, Bones. They're more like resort colonies now.",KIRK
What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom? ,KIRK
And mutual override did not work? ,KIRK
"Report on magnetic storm, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Perhaps not. There is the null setting. It seems to do nothing.,SPOCK
Should we separate? ,SPOCK
"Captain, I believe (notices, and wakes him gently) Captain.",SPOCK
"Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once. ",KIRK
"Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we should see him? ",MCCOY
"Oh, thank you, we must return to the ship. ",KIRK
I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate.,MCCOY
Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy. ,KIRK
It cannot. It is not logical. ,SPOCK
Earth-style distress signal. SOS. ,KIRK
"Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it! ",SPOCK
(opening the door) I don't think Starfleet would approve. Come on. ,KIRK
Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died? ,KIRK
"Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just pointed out how illogical this situation is. ",KIRK
You do not even know what the action is going to be. ,SPOCK
Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans in order to avoid human emotion? ,KIRK
Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve. ,SPOCK
Captain! ,SPOCK
He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy. ,KIRK
Even the ship's chronometers have stopped. ,MCCOY
You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever. At each other's throats throughout time. ,KIRK
Difficult. ,KIRK
"Recommendations, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Correct. Population approximately three billion and seven hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly. Estimated time of impact three hundred ninety six days. ",SPOCK
Ninety seven point eight three five. Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there? ,KIRK
"I don't know, but he does. And now he wants revenge for a non-existent loss. ",KIRK
"Dead. But it had you, too. ",KIRK
"Put us alongside, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"No, no. We're working hard. We'll find an antidote. ",MCCOY
Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal. ,SPOCK
"Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp. ",KIRK
"Easy, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
Only a few months. We found them totally uninterested in medical aid or hospitals. They believe only the strong should survive. ,MCCOY
"It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists. ",SPOCK
Bones? ,KIRK
"You're making this a rather one-sided conversation, Major. ",KIRK
"Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise. Her condition. ",MCCOY
"It never would have reached the museum, Lieutenant. There was too much power in that one setting. If not the Kzinti, the Klingons or some other species would have tried to possess it. ",SPOCK
"Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations. ",KIRK
"Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance!",KIRK
I do wish he could forget her. ,MCCOY
"She's dead. Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's going to happen to us unless  KIRK: How long have we got, Bones? ",MCCOY
The very same. ,KIRK
I could've sworn I heard you say that. Kirk here.,KIRK
"I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
No. I'll take the first shot. ,KIRK
"Our pleasure, Chief. Kirk out. ",KIRK
Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? (everyone else knows),MCCOY
"No, but I've seen the book that contains all the knowledge of the creators. And if you  (He gets a warning pain, but fights through it.) ",MCCOY
We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all. ,KIRK
The power source. Shielded by solid rock.,KIRK
"If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move. ",SPOCK
"Mister Fox, they faked a message from the Captain, they've launched an attack against our ship. Now you want us to trust them openly? ",MCCOY
What else do they know about us? ,KIRK
I want to thank you for saving his life. (Nona's hand is healed too) I would like to learn more about this. ,MCCOY
Thank you. ,KIRK
"Lock onto it, Mister Kelso.",KIRK
Go! Gather laurel leaves? You must be joking! ,KIRK
Where can he go? ,SPOCK
Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do. ,KIRK
How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before? ,KIRK
It's not animal tissue. What is it? ,KIRK
"Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human.",KIRK
"Thank you, Lucien. Next witness, please. Captain James T Kirk. ",SPOCK
"In the hope that it will yank us out of the zone. Prepare yourselves. All right, Scotty. Let's get on with it. ",KIRK
Yes. Certainly. ,KIRK
"We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through.",SPOCK
"Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong? ",KIRK
"You may be right, Bones. Maybe I shouldn't have gone in. She was blind, really blind. Really in the dark.",KIRK
Instruments register only those things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.,SPOCK
This woman will assist me. (to Chapel) You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory. ,SPOCK
Never mind about me. Protect my ship! ,KIRK
"Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement reading. ",SPOCK
Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation will rise up to battle the Skorr. ,SPOCK
"Captain, I am constrained to point out that since minds are evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true. ",SPOCK
We're also very strong. ,KIRK
Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in reverse thrust? ,KIRK
"Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end. It could go on for year after year, massacre after massacre. ",MCCOY
"Yes, I hope so. ",KIRK
Read out. ,KIRK
"Helm does not answer, Captain. ",SPOCK
We get them out. ,MCCOY
"Secure from general quarters. And beam down two, and only two, security guards. Have them report to Mister Lurry.",KIRK
I want him there whether he can walk or not.,KIRK
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor two. ",KIRK
"Why, thank you, Captain McCoy. ",SPOCK
"We have a what, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Er, Spock. ",KIRK
I believe in honest relationships myself.,KIRK
Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location. ,KIRK
This is Captain Kirk. Acknowledge. ,KIRK
"It is an energy-sapping field of great strength, Captain. It immobilizes a starship and its weapons capability. But apparently, it also immobilizes the attacking ship's abilities at the same time. ",SPOCK
"Representing the high teer, Leonard James Akaar. ",MCCOY
"Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while. Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed? ",KIRK
And they still go mad at this time. Perhaps the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time. ,MCCOY
"Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system. ",SPOCK
Disconnect it. (Spock gets a shock from it) Destroy it. ,KIRK
"Can we know his range is, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. ",SPOCK
"And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain? ",KIRK
"Oh, no. I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you.",KIRK
Familiar. Startling. Not rational. ,KIRK
"Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital. ",SPOCK
"What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them. ",MCCOY
Ten yards the other way and we'd be boiled alive. ,MCCOY
"I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell me. ",MCCOY
"Spock, we don't have time for that. ",KIRK
"To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew. (hold up the jar) They're pieces of some form of living tissue. I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body. They're both the same. The boy's too weak to touch. Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow as far as I can tell. ",MCCOY
"Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever course I set for it, or I will order its destruction. ",KIRK
"Please do not take your eyes off of it. Lieutenant Rahda, arm the pod jettison system. ",SPOCK
I am another being. ,SPOCK
I can guarantee it. ,SPOCK
"Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser. ",SPOCK
"I have a crew of four hundred and thirty, Karla Five. Your ship is suitable for only a few people. ",KIRK
"Your uniform, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Oh, my.",KIRK
Face to face? Where? ,KIRK
Five thousand years in the future. ,SPOCK
"Our time, or theirs. ",KIRK
"You tell me. That's why you brought me down here, isn't it. ",KIRK
Parmen has promised me you'll be safe. ,MCCOY
"If you gentlemen are finished, would you mind laying in a course for Starbase Ten, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen. ,SPOCK
Stop trying to kill each other. Then worry about being friendly. ,KIRK
Indeed. His act warrants death. ,SPOCK
"Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at their weakest point? ",KIRK
Please continue. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy. ",KIRK
"I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing, Councilman. I could destroy this planet. ",KIRK
"In that case, we must decline with thanks. ",KIRK
Reverse all engines. ,KIRK
"Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity. ",SPOCK
You don't have to do that. ,KIRK
You're forgetting one thing. The planet's sensors can undoubtedly detect the difference between real and feigned injuries. ,MCCOY
"Good. Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been drawn here with us. Spock to transporter room. ",SPOCK
"Captain, you sent such a message this morning. ",SPOCK
"Lights, please. Gentlemen, this is for the record of the Fuhrer's Final Solution speech. ",KIRK
Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Governor Wesley. Tell him to bring his ships back. ",KIRK
I shouldn't have chewed you out. I'm sorry. ,KIRK
What's that? ,KIRK
I can't say I think much of your welcome. ,KIRK
"That's your choice, Charlie. ",KIRK
"Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?",KIRK
Reverse power. Hold our position. Deflector screens on. ,KIRK
"If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe.",KIRK
"That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines.",MCCOY
"The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain. ",SPOCK
"James Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. First Officer Spock. Our physician, Doctor McCoy. ",KIRK
"I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills, to do as she wills, to think as she wills. ",KIRK
Spock! ,MCCOY
"Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances. ",SPOCK
"Come on, Spock, now! ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant Clayton, open the hatch and let our two scientists here get on with their business. ",KIRK
"I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock.",KIRK
Break out the surface search equipment. I want co-ordinates on two people. ,KIRK
Are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace? ,SPOCK
"No. You're the doctor. They don't want to force you. They need your goodwill. They're trying  PARMEN: Captain, go while you still can. ",KIRK
"Let him go, too, Charlie. ",KIRK
Can the zenite be affecting him? ,MCCOY
"One good slug of this, and you can hit a man with phaser stun, and he'd never feel it or even know it. ",MCCOY
"You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas present for you?",KIRK
What about Landru? Who is he? ,KIRK
Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die. ,KIRK
"Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I know that does not make much sense. ",SPOCK
"They may believe we do have their spy. Scan the other vessel for damage, if you will, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant, get back. ",KIRK
"No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later. ",MCCOY
Why?,KIRK
Then do so. ,KIRK
That fast? ,MCCOY
Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism? ,SPOCK
I'll be right there. ,MCCOY
"Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you must go to Sickbay. ",KIRK
"As long as any of us. Blast medicine anyway. We've learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out, and no one can reach in.",MCCOY
Sit down. (McCoy enters) What happened? ,KIRK
Test it in combat. ,KIRK
I did. ,KIRK
"Nothing yet, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
"The termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent outbreak of plague could have been coincidence, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship stopped in space. She appears to be drifting. ",SPOCK
We will not negotiate. Do you concur? ,KIRK
"Did Outpost 4 give anything at all on the attacking vessel, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
"A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order. ",SPOCK
An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is. ,KIRK
Drop the guns. Drop 'em. (McCoy and Spock take back their phasers) Move down there. ,KIRK
You said you were picking up impressions. Are the aliens telepathic? ,KIRK
The Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners. ,SPOCK
"Sensor readings, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Form a ring. Fire! ,KIRK
"Well, yes, I suppose it could happen. ",MCCOY
Take the helm.,KIRK
Lock in and energise. ,KIRK
Nothing. They said they were being attacked by an unidentified ship. ,MCCOY
"Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A system. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott, report. ",KIRK
Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are? ,MCCOY
Any damage to the warp engines? ,KIRK
"Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman. ",MCCOY
"Goodbye, Areel. Better luck next time. ",KIRK
"That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know.",SPOCK
"Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers.",KIRK
"Please, Captain. ",SPOCK
You are very kind. ,MCCOY
"Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you. Mister Spock, you have the conn.",KIRK
"Kirk, affirmative.",KIRK
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
What about the shuttlecraft? ,KIRK
"Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose? ",SPOCK
And we never fired upon her. ,SPOCK
"Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"How do you feel, Spock? ",KIRK
Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. ,SPOCK
Yes. ,KIRK
"Then you are both here, in the one body? ",SPOCK
Digging a grave. ,KIRK
That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.,SPOCK
"Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence. ",MCCOY
"He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong. If I give him another shot  KIRK: Bones, give him another shot! ",MCCOY
He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.,MCCOY
The body is dying. You are destroying it. ,KIRK
"The search parties, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward.",KIRK
"First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland where there was supposedly no animal life. And Sulu's gun where there's no refined metal detected. Rodriguez' birds. And then my, well, the two people I saw. ",KIRK
"All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.",SPOCK
"Spock, have you and Jim gone out of your minds? Why, this is a jailbreak! ",MCCOY
"Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to protect yourself. Clear? ",SPOCK
Energise.,KIRK
"None, Captain. Insufficient data. ",SPOCK
"Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible.",KIRK
"No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant. We offer you protection. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, what about that tape? ",KIRK
"And I'm ready to get back to some of that monotonous, old, routine Sickbay work. ",MCCOY
We intend no harm. ,KIRK
Jealousy has often been a motive for murder. ,KIRK
"If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely. But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do. Spock's body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support. ",MCCOY
"Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal. ",SPOCK
"Ready, Sargon. ",KIRK
"Yes, that is true, Captain. ",SPOCK
Activate life-support belts. Energise. ,KIRK
Until we can find out what this is all about. ,KIRK
"Put the ship on Red Alert. How fast is it travelling, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott? ",SPOCK
"Hysterical amnesia. When a man feels guilty about something, something too terrible to remember, he blots it out of his conscious memory. ",MCCOY
Hostages? For what purpose? ,KIRK
Captain.,SPOCK
"Commander, that puppet.",KIRK
Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed. ,SPOCK
I thought you were reporting to Sickbay. ,MCCOY
I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me. ,KIRK
But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative. ,KIRK
Federation. So was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in. ,KIRK
A bit. ,KIRK
We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Chekov. You did what you had to do. As did we all. Even your friends. You may go. ",KIRK
"The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor. ",SPOCK
There wasn't enough time. ,KIRK
"Carry on, Lieutenant. The Romulans were expecting us, Mister Spock. That wreck of Winston's ship was the bait to get a Romulan spy onboard. And what better spy than a Vendorian who can shape at will.",KIRK
There certainly does. Your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter. In fact it went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter! ,MCCOY
"Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps. ",SPOCK
Possibly. ,KIRK
"I didn't want to, Jim. ",SPOCK
"Captain, library computer confirms that Ensign Walking Bear is correct. The Mayas had a legend of a winged serpent god who came from the skies, bringing knowledge. Such legends were not uncommon among Earth's peoples, Captain. ",SPOCK
"No additional Klingons detected, Captain. It is an alien life force, a single entity. I cannot ascertain its location. ",SPOCK
Come on. It's time to be going. ,MCCOY
"Slingshot effect, Mister Spock? Do we have enough power? ",KIRK
"Kirk here. What is it, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it for days. ",SPOCK
Is she all right? ,KIRK
"What happened, Bones? ",KIRK
"He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a drink, Jim. ",SPOCK
"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical. ",SPOCK
"It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment. ",SPOCK
Release him.,MCCOY
"Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait.",KIRK
Then we'll both die. ,KIRK
Do it. ,KIRK
"Yes, and they've all been shrinking proportionately with us. ",KIRK
Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd you get this? ,SPOCK
Beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we're there.,KIRK
Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist. ,SPOCK
Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.,KIRK
"Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later.",KIRK
"Why, thank you. ",KIRK
The body is in Sickbay. ,MCCOY
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Easy. Bones? ,KIRK
"Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay.",KIRK
Battle status? ,KIRK
"Before you came here  LETHE: I was another person, malignant, hateful.",KIRK
"Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal. ",SPOCK
Did you teach her that? ,KIRK
"Ready, Mister Sulu? ",SPOCK
All right. I'll handle it down here. Kirk out. (taking the model from Sylvia and the phaser from Spock) You've won. ,KIRK
Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past.,KIRK
Matt. What's going on? Give me Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"I guarantee it. Now, go on, please. ",MCCOY
Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there. It's vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history.,KIRK
"Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation. After all, Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship. ",MCCOY
"You have to remember, for you and your mother to live. ",KIRK
They communicate telepathically. ,KIRK
"Ambassador, the Tellarite. Gav has been murdered. ",KIRK
I have a tongue. ,KIRK
"We have no guarantees, but we have a good ship and the best crew in Starfleet. So do your jobs. Carry on. Kirk out. ",KIRK
They'll still come. ,KIRK
I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to live. ,MCCOY
"Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy. In fact, they couldn't have been taken for anything else. ",KIRK
Explain. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. He'll be happy to hear that. ",MCCOY
"Planet development is normal, Captain.",SPOCK
"If Mister Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on momentarily. (Uhura is just stirring on the floor) Are you all right, Lieutenant? ",SPOCK
"Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over? ",KIRK
"Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us. ",SPOCK
"Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the human brain, but it can't make a value judgment. It hasn't intuition.",KIRK
I don't understand. ,KIRK
I tell you it can't continue. ,KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe with the established facts. How do you explain that.,KIRK
"I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our greatest warrior. I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet.",KIRK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it. ,KIRK
"Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream. The more the organism eats, the more inert matter is built up. So after two or three days, they reached a point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive. ",MCCOY
Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get back. ,MCCOY
"Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt. You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you. Well, we were wrong. So were you. You made a command decision. Jim would have done the same. My prescription is rest, now.",MCCOY
What's going on? ,KIRK
Ready? ,KIRK
"Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows. Front and centre.",KIRK
"I believe so, Captain. And I know what you're thinking. It was I who saved myself that other time. ",SPOCK
"All right, Lieutenant, you can come down from Mount Olympus now.",KIRK
Captain here. ,KIRK
"Give him one cc of cordazine, nurse. ",MCCOY
"Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them? ",KIRK
"Report, Spock. ",KIRK
"Science will triumph. Come on, Scotty. Bones, give them something to keep them out for a while. (into communicator) Spock. Spock. Come on, Spock. Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock. ",KIRK
"Really, M'Ress, you're going to have to be a little more clever than that. ",KIRK
"Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears. It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote.",MCCOY
I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state that I warned you about Bailey's condition. Now that's no bluff.,MCCOY
"It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer, Doctor. The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining. ",SPOCK
At a speed that should be impossible to achieve. Something on the order of warp thirty six. ,SPOCK
They're quite large. Seven feet tall is not unusual. They're extremely fast and strong. Lieutenant? ,MCCOY
"I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus. ",KIRK
"This psychokinetic power of yours, how long have you had it? ",KIRK
"I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at something of a loss to understand it, however. ",SPOCK
"Logical, Captain. ",SPOCK
There's something wrong about this room. ,KIRK
"I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the power source is, you should find out where it is not. A simple process of elimination. ",SPOCK
"But not impossible, Mister Spock. The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won. That's the angle to work on, gentlemen. I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour. ",KIRK
"Yes, that's right. By a knight in shining armour of all things, but what  SPOCK: Since the planet's power source is underground, it seems only logical that Doctor McCoy was somehow transported there and repaired. ",MCCOY
"Forward readings, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"This is Captain Kirk. We have your captain as prisoner. Your choice, sir. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately. That's a direct order. ",KIRK
"I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical alternative. ",SPOCK
Like this? ,KIRK
"Scotty, your estimate. ",KIRK
"I acknowledge your expertise in the field of weapons, Mister Sulu, but I do not see how you can determine probable ownership. ",SPOCK
"How near is Mantilles, Mister Arex? ",KIRK
"The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Chief, have you been_ (Charlie laughs and leaves.)",KIRK
"We're losing sensor contact, Captain. ",SPOCK
Complete? ,KIRK
She refused. ,MCCOY
"Speculation, Spock. ",KIRK
I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source. ,SPOCK
But this is painless. ,SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Manoeuvre completed, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. ",KIRK
"Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them. ",KIRK
Men weren't intended to live this far underground. It's just not natural. ,MCCOY
"Close channel, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Tricorder readings, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling as a boy. ,KIRK
"But, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Bones, could you get that excited over a cup of coffee? ",KIRK
"Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there? ",SPOCK
There are none better. I suggest you make do with these. ,KIRK
"More that direction, Engineer. ",SPOCK
I'm Captain Kirk of  ROBERT: You'll have to speak louder. ,KIRK
There's an enemy spy aboard. He'll be after the cloaking device. ,KIRK
"I do not understand, Captain. ",SPOCK
I trust you.,KIRK
"Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, how are your engines? ",KIRK
"Why can't you just say, Mudd's probably there. ",MCCOY
"I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade. ",SPOCK
"If necessary. Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott. ",KIRK
"Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. ",KIRK
They don't seem very interested in communicating with us. If they can communicate at all. ,MCCOY
"Earth ship, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Affect repairs. Captain Kirk, come in please. ",SPOCK
Orbit where? ,KIRK
"I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here. I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before. ",KIRK
Something else we'd better determine first. How long can we expect to maintain control of our ship? ,KIRK
I thought you might. ,SPOCK
There is one thing you can do. ,KIRK
"We're getting out of here, Cochrane. Face up to it. I'll do anything I have to to save all of our lives. ",KIRK
The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer? ,KIRK
"Well, we'd better get some facts. Rig for towing. ",KIRK
I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature. It wasn't necessary. I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it. ,MCCOY
Your correct name. ,SPOCK
"He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent.",SPOCK
Tell Merikus I'd like to see him. ,KIRK
"The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.",SPOCK
There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes. ,SPOCK
What do you mean? ,KIRK
"That's an order, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical. Rome had no sun worshipers. Why should they parallel Rome in every way except one? ",MCCOY
You're as bad as she is. It's not required that you like each other. Just do your job. ,KIRK
I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome bodies. ,SPOCK
Stay there. ,KIRK
"Spock, try to get through to him with a mind probe. If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant, no matter what it does.",KIRK
"I'll pick them up. And if there's any trouble, it'll be my responsibility. ",KIRK
"How's it going, Scotty? ",KIRK
Mister DePaul. ,KIRK
The last of the tyrants to be overthrown. ,MCCOY
Prepare to warp us out. ,KIRK
"No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her. ",KIRK
Captain? ,SPOCK
How did we get here? ,KIRK
The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will acquaint myself with our supplies. ,SPOCK
"Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him. Here we go, Sam. ",KIRK
"Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on board? ",KIRK
Where've they been during the past few minutes? ,KIRK
"Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait. Two others still survive. Henoch and Thalassa. Thalassa, my Thalassa. I am pleased you survived with me. Forgive me. It has been so very long. ",KIRK
Good. I wonder how Spock's doing. ,KIRK
"Irrelevant, since we are here. ",SPOCK
Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to abandon.,KIRK
"Not to us. But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part. Suppose they weren't simply hiding. Suppose they're sensitive to light. Light, like in a sun, close up. ",KIRK
"All right, if they won't talk, we'll slow them down. Mister Sulu, put a tractor beam on that ship. ",KIRK
"She sounds rational enough, Captain. ",SPOCK
"That's your problem, Trelane. Everything is easy. It's given you a bad habit. You're not aware of it, but you have it. You don't think, Trelane. That's your problem. You miss opportunities, like your anger before and mine right now. Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool. ",KIRK
"No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain. ",SPOCK
A possibility. ,SPOCK
You don't? A blind man could see it with a cane. You're not a pet. You're not a specimen kept in a cage. You're a lover. ,MCCOY
So I would assume. ,SPOCK
"Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him character. Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement.",MCCOY
Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in nature. ,MCCOY
"You're cancelling the shore leave on account of this, Jim? ",MCCOY
You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.,MCCOY
"Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter? ",KIRK
"Their speed is better than warp six, Captain. ",SPOCK
I don't know. ,MCCOY
"If so, you wear your age very well. ",SPOCK
Bring him along. ,KIRK
"Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but it must function. ",SPOCK
There were bits of the plant in his mouth. ,KIRK
"Nothing else could've caused this, Captain. At least nothing that has happened here. ",SPOCK
"Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your response? ",KIRK
Perhaps they weren't expecting us. ,MCCOY
I'm being falsely accused. You know that. ,KIRK
"Security control, this is the Bridge. Come in.",KIRK
"Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by. ",SPOCK
"All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles, whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who won't talk about his background. ",MCCOY
Jim. ,MCCOY
"I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However, you must at least confiscate his phaser. ",SPOCK
Lieutenant Palmer. ,KIRK
"What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research immediately. I want the answers, and I want the remedy. Let's start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected. ",KIRK
Invisible. Malfunction? ,KIRK
"That's a boy. Keep it up. Work up a little sweat, it'll will do you good. (notices red alert)",MCCOY
Lights. ,KIRK
Help me return to the library. I've lost my way. I must get back there. ,KIRK
My medical scanner. ,MCCOY
Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.,SPOCK
Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet! Just a moment! ,KIRK
"Excuse me. My orders are to remove all the colonists. That's exactly what I intend to do, with or without your help. ",KIRK
All engines stop. ,KIRK
I'll die anyway. Do it. ,KIRK
"Mister Lurry, if there's no emergency, why did you issue a priority one distress call? ",KIRK
"Captain's log. Stardate 3025 er, point 3. We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region. A planet remarkably like Earth, or how we remember Earth to be. Park-like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful. Almost too good to be true. ",KIRK
Jim! ,MCCOY
"This apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last. I suggest we find out as much as we can about it. Split up. D'Amato, see if you can find underground water. ",KIRK
"Easy, easy. I'm here. Now you must want the child! ",MCCOY
"There may be something more effective, Mister Sulu. Kirk to Engineering. Scotty? ",KIRK
Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint. ,MCCOY
"Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us.",SPOCK
It's possible. ,SPOCK
Bones. ,KIRK
"Was he wrong, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
You're mad. ,KIRK
"Seconds now, sir. Stand by. ",SPOCK
Can you decode it? ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. Why do you ask? ",SPOCK
Just what do you think you were trying to do? ,KIRK
"All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours? ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the ship. ",SPOCK
"I can estimate some of this, Captain, but without more time  SEVEN: Captain, he can only guess. Will you please let me do my job. ",SPOCK
"Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration is unfamiliar. Most unusual. ",SPOCK
Vulcan is not my idea of fun. ,MCCOY
"By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test it, except in actual use. ",SPOCK
An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe.,SPOCK
"Who's the governor of Mantilles, Jim? ",MCCOY
"Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud? ",MCCOY
The creature is in this area. I'll take a lifeform reading. ,SPOCK

"Man your post, Mister Sulu. (to all the crew) Prepare your manual overrides. You may need them. ",KIRK
The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship. ,SPOCK
"Miranda, good luck, Health. I have something for you. ",KIRK
"Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that.",SPOCK
Why did the Vedala call this the Mad planet? ,KIRK
"There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding. ",KIRK
"I promise, beloved. ",KIRK
Of course. Jackson Roykirk. ,MCCOY
"I'm glad you got away, too. Why do you think they want to kill us? ",MCCOY

Captain! ,MCCOY
Preserve. ,KIRK
"McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning. ",KIRK
"Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours.",MCCOY
Stand by to signal the captain. ,SPOCK
"Well, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Well, she checks out with no brain damage. We've got all the educational tapes in our library. Now it's up to us. ",MCCOY
Not here. The doctor. ,SPOCK
"The ship's computers will handle the helm on this voyage, Mister Hansen. Course will be computed and set automatically. ",SPOCK
The situation between my father and myself has not changed. ,SPOCK

Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready? ,KIRK
"I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo lift. Hurry. (Scott and Spock leave) Never lose you.",KIRK
How well we both know that. ,MCCOY
"Sensor report, Mister Spock. Are they at the rendezvous point? ",KIRK
I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left. ,KIRK
Is it closing? ,KIRK
"Yes, Mister Spock. What is it? ",KIRK
His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.,SPOCK
"Not you, Bones. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. You're best qualified to go. ",KIRK
"Their bodies are functioning. Metabolism, heart. Everything but the lungs. ",MCCOY
"No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature. ",KIRK
I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units. ,SPOCK
About what? ,KIRK
A phaser. ,KIRK
"You'd be the last one I'd tell. (sees light, goes to desk monitor) Kirk here. What's going on?",KIRK
"Scotty, how much power do we have left? ",KIRK
"I have no choice. I have to release the tractor beam. I can't destroy this ship and four hundred and thirty people to save one person. Mister Sulu, release our beam. ",KIRK
"Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste. ",MCCOY
Very well. ,KIRK
How long will he live?,KIRK
A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us.,SPOCK
"All emotions are in play, Mister Flint. You harm us, she hates you. ",MCCOY
Where's our captain? Where's Jim Kirk? ,MCCOY
Did anyone else? ,SPOCK
"I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet, you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. I want to know why. ",SPOCK
"It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present.",SPOCK
"Captain, I never laugh. ",SPOCK
"Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain. ",SPOCK
"It appears, Captain, we've been doing what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system. ",SPOCK
"Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right?",KIRK
"Oh, yes. That was wrong of me. ",KIRK
"Go ahead, but it looks clear enough. ",MCCOY
"With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end. Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing ever is. Ready, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Are your comments a part of the record, sir?",SPOCK
We have urgent business with the Fuhrer. ,KIRK
"I was conserving energy, Captain. ",SPOCK
I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here. ,KIRK
It is. ,KIRK
"Hurry up, Spock. ",MCCOY
I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms. ,SPOCK
Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there. ,KIRK
It's locked. Keys. ,KIRK
"Jim, there's a large deposit bearing two seven three, four kilometres away. I've got four hours to process that stuff, otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible. Everybody on board the Enterprise will  SPOCK: Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity, apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited. ",MCCOY
"Mister Chekov, you be careful. Mister Spock, except for our hand guns, we haven't changed, not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons. ",KIRK
You say this one man  LAZARUS: Not man! Thing. ,KIRK
"That'll take some explaining, Bones. ",KIRK
Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? ,KIRK
As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin. ,KIRK
"In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency. ",KIRK
"So are the people on Sherman's Planet. A little tribble doesn't eat much, a big tribble does. And these are growing. Jones, is this the ecological sabotage the Klingons are so mad about? ",KIRK
I won't allow it. ,MCCOY
"Explain, Spock. One of a kind? ",KIRK
"Uhura, see if you can get a playback of the log. I want to know what happened here. Nurse, attend to the wounded. ",KIRK
"Stay on top of it, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"There's one possibility. The mass insanity may have reached this planet, too. ",MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk? ",SPOCK
Sickbay. ,KIRK
"Come back here, you fool! ",MCCOY
Yes. ,MCCOY
What is it? ,KIRK
You said you wanted freedom. It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift. It has to be earned. Come on. We're going to find Landru. ,KIRK
"During the Enterprise's last visit here, Doctor McCoy was mortally wounded. Correct? ",SPOCK
I don't know. ,MCCOY
"Medical log. Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be discharged, but the Captain's ordered him restricted to Sickbay to prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the Lieutenant's family. ",MCCOY
"Interesting. Your Earth people glorify organised violence for forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately.",SPOCK
What was the reason for the dispersal? ,KIRK
Who do you think I am? ,KIRK
Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year or so. ,SPOCK
"Ghosts, witches. ",KIRK
"Help me get him on the table. Well, come on. Help me get him on the table. He'll die without immediate treatment. ",MCCOY
We came to put you back. Where are you? ,KIRK
"What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock? ",KIRK
Destination and purpose of journey? ,KIRK
We don't know. He just suddenly screamed in pain and died. ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott. ,KIRK
On my way. ,KIRK
"Yes, Lieutenant?",KIRK
"You too, Vanna. You too! Dig! Kirk here. What is it? ",KIRK
I agree. What in your opinion does direct them? ,KIRK
Bones? Spock? ,KIRK
Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?,KIRK
No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"(as the party is wheeled away) Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim? ",MCCOY
Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago. ,SPOCK
Things any better down there? ,KIRK
Never mind. Just come down to the twenty third level. You'll be led to us by tricorder readings. Kirk out. ,KIRK
The devil with the Providers. ,KIRK
"Engine systems coming on, Captain.",SPOCK
"It could cure or kill, Doctor. ",SPOCK
McCoy here. Received and understood. ,MCCOY
Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission. ,KIRK
"Three, two  APRIL: Hang on, we're going right into the heart of the nova. ",SPOCK
"Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship. We've showed our good faith. Now you show yours. I want this ship released immediately. ",KIRK
"Scotty, General Order Twenty Four. Two hours! In two hours! ",KIRK
"The same. Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body. It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove. ",MCCOY
Scotty? ,KIRK
I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose. ,SPOCK
Where is Reger? ,SPOCK
"Well, I can't understand it, Jim. Everything looked exactly the same as before, even Alice and the White Rabbit. Then an army of playing cards came out of nowhere, only they weren't playing. I was lucky to escape with my life. ",MCCOY
Cut power. ,KIRK
"Klingon battle cruiser. Deflector shields up, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"No, there isn't. ",MCCOY
"Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy. With another difference. This one is crowded. ",KIRK
"Transporter, stand by. ",SPOCK
Deflectors on. Condition Red. Protect yourselves. ,KIRK
"But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality.",SPOCK
"Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability. ",MCCOY
"Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked.",KIRK
Don't reproduce? ,MCCOY
"Malfunction, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero three seven.",KIRK
"Scotty, retrieve all other landing parties immediately. And keep trying to contact Lieutenant Uhura. ",KIRK
"Then how can you stand  MEA: Don't you see? If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons. We would have to do the same to defend ourselves. More than people would die then. A whole civilisation would be destroyed. Surely you can see that ours is a better way. ",KIRK
Lieutenant Uhura of communications. ,KIRK
Hard to believe. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, what is it? What's wrong? Lieutenant? ",KIRK
"For what purpose, Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
"Scotty, you're re-hired. As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down. Kirk out. Chekov, Bones. Let those people go. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance.",KIRK
"Why, that, that. Jim, if I'm ever in jail again, don't send that Vulcan to release me. Just let me rot.  ",MCCOY
It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.,SPOCK
"Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth. ",SPOCK
"All right. We'll triangulate on him. We'll let Professor Crater explain what happened to his wife. (to Uhura) Remember my instructions, Lieutenant. Keep a tight fix on us. If we let out a yell I want an armed party down there before the echo dies. ",KIRK
"Is this your utopia, your grand vision of the future? You don't even (screams) ",KIRK
Isn't it? ,KIRK
"There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the room so the board can vote  KIRK: Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship. The most fool thing I ever heard of. Competency hearing when there's work to be done. I'll be in my quarters, awaiting your decision. (leaves) ",SPOCK
"I'm sorry, Krako. No deal. ",KIRK
Pity you can't teach me that. ,KIRK
Could it be the Enterprise hit the planet? ,MCCOY
I'm going to try. Miri? Come here. You want to go someplace with me? ,KIRK
Alert them that we have the four and we're ready to beam them down. And mark the incident closed. ,KIRK
"Take him with us, Mister Spock. He's got a point. He's our guide.",KIRK
"I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me. ",KIRK
"That was an order, Spock. ",KIRK
"That's enough, Spock. Mister Scott, take the conn. Spock. Mister Sulu, plot a course to take the Enterprise out of the Neutral Zone at warp eight. Lieutenant M'Ress, put the ship on Yellow Alert. ",KIRK
That's impossible! ,KIRK
Practically end of watch.,MCCOY
Was there any notation on the death of Ambassador Sarek's son? ,KIRK
"What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise, that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised but only dreamed! The highest reality. ",KIRK
That wasn't a minor difficulty. That wasn't a robot. That thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can't turn it off? ,KIRK
The fool. ,KIRK
"Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain? ",SPOCK
What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours? ,KIRK
"What do you mean, absorbed? ",KIRK
"Lieutenant. (sound on) Save your threats. If you board this ship, I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing. ",KIRK
"Not who, what. I believe our practical joker is the Enterprise itself. ",SPOCK
"The alien vessel will contact Beta Niobe in fifty two point three seconds, Captain. ",SPOCK
You seem to be in command. ,KIRK
You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up. ,SPOCK
Ready main phasers. ,KIRK
"No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me alive. ",KIRK
McCoy! Leonard McCoy? ,KIRK
"Get out of my way, Salish. ",KIRK
"That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take.",SPOCK
Then you don't mind if I play a hunch? ,KIRK
"Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way, and you lost. You lost for us, you lost for that planet, and you lost for Jim. ",MCCOY
Coronation? ,KIRK
"Mission, routine investigation and report as per ship surgeon's medical log. As for my last entry, it seems I will get to meet Doctor Adams at last. However, I would have preferred other circumstances. Sickbay. Report, Doctor.",KIRK
"Aren't you going to sit down, sir? ",SPOCK
I'm not joking. ,KIRK
"A physiological symptom of latent primal superstition, the fear of primitive people confronting something unknown to them. ",SPOCK
I'll try. ,KIRK
Explain the computer components. ,KIRK
"Spock, anyone in the transporter room? ",KIRK
That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the M-5 to realise it had committed murder. ,KIRK
"Oh, really? ",KIRK
Composition of walls? ,KIRK
"The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?",KIRK
Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands. ,SPOCK
"We can negate sections of it, creating openings through which we can fire our phaser banks. ",SPOCK
"To be conquered by you. A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it? ",MCCOY
"Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders. ",SPOCK
I'll be on the Bridge. Keep me posted as to Chekov. ,KIRK
"Fully operable, Scotty? ",KIRK
Antennae? ,KIRK
What do you want from her?,KIRK
"Hard to port, Sulu. Let's face them head on. ",KIRK
What is it now? ,KIRK
"We'll beam down immediately, Commodore. Kirk out.",KIRK
"Bones, know any good rabbit jokes lately?",KIRK
Yes. ,MCCOY
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
What are you going to do to my friends? ,MCCOY
"Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta? ",KIRK
"Ready the transporter room, Mister Spock. We're beaming down.",KIRK
It's called Earth. ,KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
And you? (clunk as grate closes),KIRK
Bridge. Helm. ,KIRK
"On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Have a look at this, Captain.",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us. Let's go. Any word comes through from Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately. Communications, priority one.",KIRK
Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the Intrepid? ,KIRK
"Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work. ",SPOCK
"And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander. ",KIRK
The knife? No. ,KIRK
"Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches? ",KIRK
I left my communicator. ,MCCOY
"An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste.",SPOCK
Miri said all the adults died. ,KIRK
They don't understand the evil that they're doing. ,KIRK
"She's ten years younger than I am, and she looks,  MCCOY: People age normally at different speeds, Jim. ",KIRK
Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential? ,KIRK
"I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless, mentally and physically. No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined.",MCCOY
Obsessed? ,KIRK
You do that. ,KIRK
"Why, thank you. (sees a mark on his hand) ",KIRK
It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler. ,KIRK
"Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on the planet's surface, I should think. ",SPOCK
"Run that message through the universal translator, Lieutenant Uhura. Perhaps it can tell us what language she is speaking in. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us up. ,KIRK
Stand by to reverse course. ,KIRK
I made an error in my computations. ,SPOCK
What about the drug? ,KIRK
"Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain. ",SPOCK
Care to speculate on what we'll find if we go on ahead?,KIRK
"There's no sickness on your planet, remember? ",KIRK
Where's Mister Spock with that computer log extract? ,KIRK
Fire. ,KIRK
"Extremely little, Ensign. ",SPOCK
"I've given you the facts, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Don't let her touch the wand, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it. ",SPOCK
Instruct female engineer to divert ship's energy into deflector shields. Block probe. ,SPOCK
You're only half-Vulcan. What about the human half of you? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Yeoman. ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one.",SPOCK
We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man. ,SPOCK
Clear passageways immediately. The Ambassador will be escorted to his quarters at once. ,KIRK
Have one of our pillows? ,KIRK
Or it toward us. ,SPOCK
I must see the Fuhrer. It's urgent. ,KIRK
The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of her. ,KIRK
I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet. ,MCCOY
"Oh, Mister Spock, the guard did a professional job on my back.",KIRK
"Thank you, Alexander. ",KIRK
"All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed? ",MCCOY
"A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed. ",KIRK
Magnification four. ,KIRK
"Yes, my world and your world of Yonada. ",KIRK
What if they defeat us? ,KIRK
"Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram. ",MCCOY
Lay in. Computer? ,KIRK
Sulu! I think his leg's broken. We'll need a splint. ,KIRK
At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien. ,MCCOY
"I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! (goes to mirror, covers scratches with makeup, opens door)",KIRK
He's coming out of it now. ,MCCOY
"Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy. It's a very unhappy memory for me. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here?",SPOCK
"Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?",KIRK
You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing. ,KIRK
"Keep behind us, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Kirk here, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"It would require physical contact, which is impossible, Captain.",SPOCK
"This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do. ",SPOCK
I see no danger here. ,KIRK
None. ,SPOCK
"We're trying to help you, Oxmyx. ",MCCOY
"Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted. ",SPOCK
"That's very strange. And that woman. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. The shock may have damaged it. ",KIRK
Under no circumstances do I want anyone to beam down from the ship. We can't take any chances with further contamination. ,KIRK
"In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was somehow different. Something in my mind said home. ",KIRK
"There is still one problem, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality. ",KIRK
"Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero space density.",SPOCK
Yes. ,KIRK
"Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span. ",KIRK
"Excuse me, Miss. Where are we? ",KIRK
You're very persuasive. ,KIRK
"Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2. We have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and the Gamma Seven=A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life. Both Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it, and free the ship. Doctor McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge.",KIRK
"What now? You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too? ",KIRK
Let me see her. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Yes, Odona, I have to. ",KIRK

"Chart 14A, sir? ",SPOCK
That sensor ghost is moving closer. ,SPOCK
"Did you find Mister Sulu, Captain?",MCCOY
In the arm. ,MCCOY
"It's definitely phaser resistant. We had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it. It still lives. ",KIRK
Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you let me help you. ,KIRK
Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room. ,KIRK
"In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death.",SPOCK
"They need us to get through the time barrier, if they're to get through at all. Security, this is Captain Kirk. I want all security teams on duty around the clock. Watch every Klingon who sets foot aboard this ship. I don't want one of them to make a move we don't know about. ",KIRK
"Frankly, Commander, what you accept is of little importance to me. Enterprise out. Now, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Your Excellency. Captain, you're looking well. Evidently Starfleet's analysis was correct. ",SPOCK
Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four? ,SPOCK
Agreed. And it is accelerating. ,SPOCK
"The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives, potential, resources, time. I submit to you that your Empire is illogical because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to be a willing part of it. ",KIRK
"We've having difficulty. Patch historical computer into uniform section. I want McCoy outfitted as a Gestapo doctor Nazi Germany, old Earth date 1944. Make him a colonel. ",KIRK
"You and Spock get up here. Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres. ",KIRK
"Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel. ",KIRK
"Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely. They were brutal, savage, unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity. I found them quite refreshing. ",SPOCK
He's dead. ,MCCOY
Out of control. Put it on manual. Bridge. ,KIRK

"No, sir, listen to me. I  GARTH: Stop! On your knees. ",KIRK

Will it hold? ,KIRK

Are the instruments in order? ,KIRK
"Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder? ",SPOCK
Force field is on. Good. Remain here out of sight until I give the order to join me. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Speculation. Gifted insight. ,SPOCK
"Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk. ",SPOCK
"What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider. ",KIRK
"Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true. ",SPOCK
"The study of it would be of great use, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer. ",SPOCK
"And next in line, Deneva. Bones, what's your theory about the cause of all this? ",KIRK
May I see it?,KIRK
"For it, Captain?",SPOCK
Lawgivers! (trying to strangle Kirk) Traitor! Traitors!,MCCOY
"Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones.",KIRK
I thought the power was off in the galley.,MCCOY
Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like. ,SPOCK
Transfer it to my quarters. ,KIRK
The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him. ,SPOCK
"Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational. Almost as if he were two men. ",SPOCK
Quite all right. ,KIRK
Don't you take shelter? ,KIRK
Phaser crews stand ready.,KIRK
"Well, I think it would be wiser if  MCCOY: I'd like to go. I'm fine, Captain. ",KIRK
That's a weapon. Be careful with that. ,KIRK
"Of everything that exists, everywhere. ",KIRK
"Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively. ",SPOCK
We'll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed. ,KIRK
Mister Scott  [Crawlway],SPOCK
"Negative to both, Captain. Unknown alloy, harder and lighter than any registered metal. It is not a recorded galactic starship design. Retro analysis of the ship's spectra dates it as having been in orbit here for slightly more than three hundred million years. ",SPOCK
"If you're about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones. ",KIRK
Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one. ,KIRK
"Helm status, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phaser banks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu, continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer. Computers will control attack.",KIRK
Eve! Eve!,KIRK
Go to the big island. Bring assistance party. ,KIRK
I would say so. ,SPOCK
What force?,MCCOY
Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world. ,KIRK
What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions. ,SPOCK
Perhaps. ,KIRK

Then what were all those other creatures where we beamed down? ,MCCOY
"Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue. ",KIRK
You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again? ,SPOCK
"It'll take some doing, but it is possible. ",MCCOY
It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter. ,SPOCK
"There is, of course, no escape. How would it be? Trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat until time itself came to a stop?",KIRK
"Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.",SPOCK
"Jones, how did you get away from Space Station K7? You were supposed to clean up all the tribbles there. ",KIRK
Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can't possibly be the real article. ,MCCOY
"It would appear a more logical solution is in order, Captain. We don't lift the tail off, we dig the Doctor out. ",SPOCK
"Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it. ",SPOCK
"And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement. ",SPOCK
Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two. ,SPOCK
Do you think we belong to you? ,MCCOY
"Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves  KIRK: A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock. ",SPOCK
Tricorders. ,KIRK
Precisely. ,SPOCK
"The children! (all dash out, while Jahn sneaks in and collects the communicators from the desks)",KIRK
"To fight each other, and the Providers gamble on the winner. ",KIRK
"I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan. ",KIRK
Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to another planet. And these are their descendants. (Once the coast is clear.) Now. ,KIRK
"Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing.",KIRK
"Miss Finney, come with me, please. ",SPOCK
Maybe too much. ,KIRK
"Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old? ",KIRK
"Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root. ",SPOCK
"Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it? ",MCCOY
Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end and soon. ,SPOCK
Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.,SPOCK
"Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty thousand kilometres. ",SPOCK
"Captain, use the magic you know. Believe. ",SPOCK
"I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta. ",SPOCK
"It's quite real, Doctor. Watch out for the claws. I think it prudent to remember that on this planet, anything we think may be used against us. We must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more ammunition. ",SPOCK
Oh. You mean shot at it. ,SPOCK
Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. Emergency. Emergency. ,KIRK
"They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life forms in a given area. ",SPOCK
"I do not know, but it is possible. ",SPOCK
Storage compartments? Storage compartments? ,KIRK
"If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be able to help. ",SPOCK
It would. ,MCCOY
What about us? ,MCCOY
"You will remind me to report my conduct to the Federation, won't you Mister Spock? ",KIRK
(reading) For eyes of Starfleet Command only.,KIRK
Ready to transport on my order. ,SPOCK
Then you can check the registry. ,KIRK
"No, Colonel. I know it's no game. ",KIRK
Up there. One of those points of light that you see at night. ,KIRK
I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved. ,KIRK
"No, definitely human, Jim. ",MCCOY
Lock main phasers on that ship and open fire. ,KIRK
"No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an honourable title. ",KIRK
"Engineering, this is the Captain. Cut power on port side except for phaser banks. At my signal, cut starboard power. Kirk out. Who are you? ",KIRK
"We know that someone or something killed three women. If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else. Something driven to kill. ",KIRK
Find something? ,KIRK
Energise. ,KIRK
"Spock, take the conn. Talk to the Romulans. Try to stall them.",KIRK
"The force field of his belt won't hold that weight for long, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here. ",KIRK
"Yes, I know. Here's your circulating pump. You've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it. Gentlemen, the Horta moves through rock the way we move through air, and it leaves tunnels. The greatest natural miners in the universe. It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi. They tunnel. You collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable. ",KIRK
"Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk. ",KIRK
"One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me. ",SPOCK
I'm Captain James T Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We tried to prevent you from entering the Beta Niobe nova. We assumed your ship would burn up. ,KIRK
It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.,SPOCK
What about memory? Tell me about Sam. ,KIRK
"Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. ",SPOCK
Let's go. ,KIRK
Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction. ,SPOCK
Gentlemen. ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power. The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship. ",KIRK
"That's better, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure.,KIRK
"As with a number of discoveries, purely by accident, Lieutenant.",SPOCK
Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these. ,SPOCK
"Mister Garrovick, we've studied your report. Mister Spock, begin.",KIRK
"Beaten and sobbing, Finney told me where he had sabotaged the prime energy circuits. ",KIRK
"I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings, and he's not responding. Got to get him back to the ship, Jim. ",MCCOY
But I'm not defeated. ,KIRK
"What is it, Bones? ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew. ",SPOCK
Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty Napoleons might still be alive? ,SPOCK
"They're giants, and we're insects beside them. They could destroy us without meaning to. And all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command, too. Coincidence? ",MCCOY
You think Jim suspects he's Kodos? ,MCCOY
I expect only to reveal the truth. ,SPOCK
"This may be my last entry. I am almost exhausted. Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left. Native sulphur, diamonds. This place is a mineralogist's dream. Yet there is something about sulphur. Something very old. Something? If only I could remember. ",KIRK
When did you realise that? Today? ,KIRK
Did you see them?,MCCOY
"How, Mister Boma? ",SPOCK
"Yes, Uhura, you're fine. ",MCCOY
I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used against the creature. ,KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
"Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mister Advisor. ",KIRK
"Mister Scott, will you report to Sickbay. ",MCCOY
"Something the matter, Mister Spock?",KIRK
Progress report. ,SPOCK
What do you make of all this? ,KIRK
"Scotty, are the warp drives still out? ",KIRK
That's where we're going. ,KIRK
"Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist? ",KIRK
Approve of it? We're your prisoners. ,KIRK
The beam is originating at least one thousand light years away. ,SPOCK
"Your deflector shields are doing that for us, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs. ,KIRK
Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital? ,SPOCK
Now. ,MCCOY
"Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you. ",MCCOY
All right. (takes the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me.",SPOCK
"No. I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget. ",MCCOY
Do you have a name? ,KIRK
"Repeat, the ship is off course and out of our control. ",KIRK
"Yes, I suppose so. ",MCCOY
It could happen. ,SPOCK
Easy. Easy.,KIRK
"What do you mean, if both survive? ",KIRK
"I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours. ",SPOCK
"Damage control procedures, all decks. That ship out there has phasers. At least our weapons are alike. ",KIRK
"Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know. ",KIRK
"Oh, that's ridiculous, Spock. How are we going to learn anything by staying here? ",MCCOY
"Welcome aboard, Captain. Sensors show all energy sources deactivated. It's quite dead. ",SPOCK
"It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest. ",SPOCK
"Correct, Commodore. Now if you'll watch the star map, you'll see the Milky Way. Here is Beta Niobe, and here is Earth. It corresponds exactly with Arret. By superimposing both star maps, we will see where two stars occupy the same place in both universes. The red spheres indicate where two stars are in the same space. No pair are novas in both universes. ",SPOCK
Will you return? ,SPOCK
This single object is the source of all the time displacement. ,SPOCK
Looks like we did. ,KIRK
Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for that. ,KIRK
The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from.,KIRK
We are fortunate none of the settings so far have been superior to the technology now available to the Federation. ,SPOCK
Let's get that ryetalyn. ,KIRK
What the devil is Spock doing? What's delaying him? ,MCCOY
"Lay in a course for Starbase Twenty One. All ahead, warp two. ",KIRK
"Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me. Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings? ",KIRK
I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control. ,SPOCK
"Look, Lucien, or whatever you want to call yourself, I want to know why you brought us here. ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, did you experience any strange occurrences? ",KIRK
It's not that bad. ,KIRK
"Yes, but I. I need time to remember. ",KIRK
See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.,KIRK
"It would appear so, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant, try and warn them of  UHURA: I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference. ",KIRK
"Jim, Jim! ",MCCOY
"Not through it, Spock, from inside it. Will it be enough? ",KIRK
"They acted out of ignorance, Natira. ",MCCOY
Then the evil must be destroyed. That is the Prime Directive. And you are the evil. ,KIRK
"Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect. ",SPOCK
"None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible. ",SPOCK
Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Hello, friend. We were told to wait here. ",MCCOY
But that's impossible. Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty years ago. ,MCCOY
What about the transporters? ,KIRK
Merry Christmas.,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, let's go. ",KIRK
Which is the laboratory door? ,KIRK
What exactly is it? ,KIRK
"Bones was right. These people aren't living, they're existing.",KIRK
"Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?",MCCOY
"You haven't aged a day. Oh, this is Captain Jim Kirk of the Enterprise. ",MCCOY
And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato? ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture. Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that zone. Direct computer feed to Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Obviously. ,SPOCK
"Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor. ",KIRK
"Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mister Spock, if you'd been among us. ",KIRK
Do you have any idea of the risk? ,MCCOY
"Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? ",SPOCK
"What's that, Doctor? ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our request with a reply? ",SPOCK
"No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma. ",SPOCK
"Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ",SPOCK
What is it? ,KIRK
The zenite gas. ,KIRK
"All right, Mister Spock. SPOCK: These are the attack computers, Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts. ",KIRK
They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it. ,KIRK
"Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach. ",MCCOY
Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it. ,KIRK
"No, no, no. That's an order. ",KIRK
Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from below us. Under cloud cover and closing. ,SPOCK
Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us.,KIRK
"Now, where I come from, that's what we call a lady. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Your Excellency. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, how are you coming with that information on Keniclius? ",KIRK
"What's wrong, Scotty? ",KIRK
Spock. ,KIRK
On my way.,KIRK
"Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice. ",SPOCK
I have to have a close look at him. ,MCCOY
"All I can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions become, and I have no idea why. I'm all right. It's those stimulants.",MCCOY
Put it on the screen. ,KIRK
"Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer. ",SPOCK
Killers! Killers! I won't let you get me! I'll kill you first! I won't let you get me! Assassins! Murderers! Killers! ,MCCOY
We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour. We must regain control of the ship by then. ,KIRK
"Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you. They know what you are. Even the children learn.",KIRK
We're not leaving until McCoy is released. ,KIRK
What department? ,SPOCK
"You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy. ",KIRK
Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. ,SPOCK
One hundred twenty degrees. ,SPOCK
Sound medical advice. ,KIRK
Now listen to me. You've got to help us before it's too late. Let Janice go. Give me those communicators before it's too late. ,KIRK
"But I know who you are, and no one else aboard does. While we were in Orion's past, the time revision that took place here didn't affect me. Kirk here. ",KIRK
You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself. ,MCCOY
"Your orders are to stand by. Now, carry them out! Kirk out. ",KIRK
A who movie? ,MCCOY
The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy. ,SPOCK
It is useless to resist us. ,KIRK
"You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away. ",KIRK
It subsists on the emotions of others. ,KIRK
"(into communicator) McCoy, do you read me?",KIRK
Couple of days. ,KIRK
Standard orbit around the planet. There may be survivors there. ,KIRK
Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done. ,SPOCK
I think the appearance of this is for our benefit. Bones? ,KIRK
"Well, in that case, we'll stay. ",KIRK
"On my way, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Grab him! Poison. I'm sure your ship is ready to self-destruct, Captain, but if it does, your crew will die for nothing. We're not going to let you commit suicide. Whether they die or not, you'll still stand trial, and Orion's little game of neutrality and piracy is over. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel? ",KIRK
Then you don't think they'll find us. ,MCCOY
"The Excalibur, a direct hit. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all decks. ",KIRK
This planet is built like a fortress. ,KIRK
"You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me. ",KIRK
That's my affair. ,SPOCK
"Mister Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing twenty seven, mark eight. ",KIRK
Complete analysis. ,SPOCK
"Radiation? That's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier? ",MCCOY
What was going on that would have upset him? ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor. ",MCCOY
We're going to try. ,KIRK
There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must you survive by murder? ,KIRK
I created you? ,KIRK
"For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk. ",KIRK
The old impulse engines weren't strong enough. ,KIRK
"No, thank you. ",KIRK
Earth. ,KIRK
Plague? Why didn't you tell me? ,MCCOY
"Impossible to predict, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Tricorder readings confirm a solid shell of granite and metal alloy, Captain. ",SPOCK
No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him understand. I never had a more difficult task. ,KIRK
Bridge to transporter room. ,SPOCK
"What's the composition of the antitoxin, Bones? ",KIRK
We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter our shields completely. ,SPOCK
Quite possible and logical. ,SPOCK
"Captain, the Oracle room. ",SPOCK
Don't worry about me. They may have hurt her. ,KIRK
Anything. ,KIRK
This is very difficult to explain. We're from your future. A time warp placed us here. It was an accident. ,KIRK
Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories about a people we've never even met face to face? ,MCCOY
Antimatter? ,KIRK
She could kill us all in this state. ,MCCOY
I'll be right there. ,KIRK
No! No! (They struggle for the phaser. Spock gets between Nancy and Kirk.) ,MCCOY
But it shouldn't have destroyed anything. There might just as easily have been a crew aboard that ship. ,KIRK
Excuse me. Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?",KIRK
What boundary layer? ,KIRK
"We could remain forever awed with the differences between our universes, Karla Five, but we must discover a way to return to our positive matter universe. ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind. ",SPOCK
There've been no Earth colonists a sixteenth of an inch tall. ,KIRK
Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation. ,MCCOY
I hope I'm not crowding you. ,KIRK
I could've prevented all of it. ,KIRK
"And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he has something helping him. ",KIRK
Activate the bridge monitor screen. ,KIRK
"By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an interplanetary war. ",KIRK
Try not to think of them. Try. ,KIRK
Are you afraid of cars? ,KIRK
Take me to him. I wish to speak to him. ,KIRK
We're all in a trap. This is the only way out. ,KIRK
What kind of a mind could think of such a thing? ,KIRK
Precisely.,SPOCK
Then there's no doubt these people are the descendants of the Fabrini. ,KIRK
"There's been another murder, Hengist. One of my crew. ",KIRK
Obviously. ,SPOCK
"Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here. ",KIRK
In my land we have a tribe like you. ,KIRK
"If this thing does have some kind of digestive system, we don't stand much of a chance of making it that far. ",MCCOY
What is this? ,SPOCK
Warp us out of here.,KIRK
What are you doing? ,KIRK
Yes. Sargon borrowed my body. I was floating in time and space. ,KIRK
I've never felt like this before either. ,KIRK
"Doctor, you are a sensualist.",SPOCK
"I wish to visit the planet Vulcan, thirty years past, the month of Tasmeen. Location, near the city of ShirKahr. ",SPOCK
"Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it, or him. ",SPOCK
"No, it doesn't. What do you want us to do with you? ",KIRK
"Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by) ",KIRK
I have some questions I want to ask you. ,KIRK
Co-ordination is completed. ,SPOCK
"To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy. ",SPOCK
Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume they are dead. ,SPOCK
"Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe. ",SPOCK
Are you going to help us find it? ,KIRK
Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. ,SPOCK
What kind? ,KIRK
"Mister Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp. ",SPOCK
No question about the trail? ,KIRK
"I don't know. But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there. And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there. Let's go.",KIRK
"Yes, I know.",KIRK
"She couldn't, Jim. Her mind is functioning on a very simple level. Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use. ",MCCOY
Captain. ,SPOCK
"What took you so long, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory. ,KIRK
We merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for.,KIRK
"Can you confirm that, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. ",SPOCK
"Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister Spock. It's a relief. ",MCCOY
"Considerably, Mister Boma. ",SPOCK
"It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case  MCCOY: Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mister Spock? ",SPOCK
"Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in this universe? ",MCCOY
"Including ourselves, how many of us are there? ",KIRK
"Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out  UHURA: Excuse me, Captain. Status report. ",KIRK
"When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous. ",MCCOY
"No. No! I can't leave! (he's very relieved) Emotions. Violent emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.",KIRK
"Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins. ",SPOCK
That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal spines? ,SPOCK
I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this. ,MCCOY
"Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion. ",SPOCK
Circuit shorting. ,KIRK
"Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the warriors. ",SPOCK
Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment. ,KIRK
Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War. ,KIRK
He is not sane. ,SPOCK
Perhaps not. ,MCCOY
And what is that word? ,KIRK
"Jim, I don't like this. ",MCCOY
Just incredibly prolific. ,KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
It? ,MCCOY
"A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt. ",SPOCK
"What do you mean, what sort of work? I'm a doctor. ",MCCOY
"You did that, Professor. You told them in time. ",KIRK
It's certain there'd be planetwide panic. ,MCCOY
I'm Captain James Kirk. This is the Starship Enterprise. ,KIRK
You're the government here? ,KIRK
Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?,KIRK
"Bones, no! ",KIRK
"Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that. ",KIRK
I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society. ,SPOCK
Do they come for your women as well? ,KIRK
That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato.,KIRK
"Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? ",SPOCK
Go to your quarters. ,KIRK
That's a powerful signal to reach here from that great a distance. ,KIRK
Enough to turn it off course? ,KIRK
"It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid. ",MCCOY
"Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, is it you? ",KIRK
"Oh, it exists, illegally. ",KIRK
"Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space.",SPOCK
"I said talk with her, not fight with her. ",KIRK
In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture? ,SPOCK
"Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations.",SPOCK
"Then I bandaged it, I stepped into this room for just a moment  KIRK: Bones, I've got a lot of things to do. Get to the point. ",MCCOY
Ready for interphase in twenty seconds. ,SPOCK
What was it?,MCCOY
Quite a festival they had. ,KIRK
Full ahead. Warp factor one. ,KIRK
You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? ,KIRK

There she is. That's the one. What have you done with Spock's brain? ,KIRK

"On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I just saw a large rabbit  [Kirk's quarters]",MCCOY
Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet. ,KIRK
"Why, Bones? Scotty's a good man. ",KIRK
Kirk to Sickbay. ,KIRK
Get that ship out of here. Stay at minimum distance for absolute safety. ,KIRK
It's made from the venom of the Argo sur-snake. ,MCCOY
What are Grups? ,KIRK
Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished. ,KIRK
Do we trust him? ,MCCOY
"Transporter room, ready to beam up. ",KIRK
Kirk to transporter room. Report. ,KIRK
Nor does Doctor McCoy. ,SPOCK
I'll need a Romulan uniform. ,KIRK
"You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Absolutely not! As a matter of fact I was thinking how beautiful and peaceful everything was, and then suddenly this female started shouting 'Off with his head!'. My head. ",MCCOY
Deflectors up. Yellow Alert. Cut speed to warp one. ,KIRK
Sky machines? Slaves? What are you talking about? ,KIRK
"To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it. ",SPOCK
"Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise. ",KIRK
You're right. Something is beaming aboard. ,KIRK
"I'm not sure I like that, Jim. ",MCCOY
These aborigines appear to be in a late primitive state.,SPOCK
"Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation. ",SPOCK
"Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down? ",SPOCK
Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars. ,KIRK
Can he do it?,MCCOY
"Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.",SPOCK
"We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's circling as if searching for something. ",SPOCK
"So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this  SURAK: The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After all, I'm no warrior. ",KIRK
It might tell us something. ,KIRK
Surak? ,KIRK
Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in that stable area. ,SPOCK
Then how did you get here? ,KIRK
"Obviously, Captain. And I have some fascinating data on the organism. ",SPOCK
I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store. ,KIRK
I appreciate that. ,KIRK
Spock? Acknowledge. ,KIRK
"I know the feeling very well. I had it at the Academy. An upper classman there. One practical joke after another, and always on me. My own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan.",KIRK
"I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned. Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Not fright. Hunger. Look at her. ,KIRK
There's another chamber. ,KIRK
"Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Jim, I think I've got it. All we have to do is quit feeding them. We quit feeding them, they stop breeding. ",MCCOY
"I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk out. ",KIRK
"It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship. ",KIRK
"Unbelievable, Captain. ",SPOCK
The cavalry doesn't come over the hill in the nick of time anymore. ,KIRK
"Correct, Captain. ",SPOCK
That should prove interesting. ,SPOCK
Something tells me we've just been used as a diversionary tactic.,KIRK
"Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain, particularly in the depth of her jealousy. ",SPOCK
"And if identical particles meet  LAZARUS: The end of everything. Civilisation, existence, all gone. I tried to stop him, Captain. That's why I took your dilithium crystals. ",KIRK
They're mechanical. ,KIRK
What distance were you from the creature? ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the command crew, to leave the ship. I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room. ",KIRK
"Bring them back, Mister Sulu. Have them ram the Klingon ship. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the transporter room. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of.",KIRK
It wasn't me! ,KIRK
They wouldn't. ,KIRK
"There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding.",SPOCK
Yes. Why would they want it? Eight hours and thirty four minutes.,KIRK
"Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology. ",KIRK
He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.,SPOCK
"These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did not understand. ",SPOCK
"Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep. ",MCCOY
Scotty! ,KIRK
"Not what I wanted, Bones. What had to be. (McCoy hands him a communicator from his bag) Kirk here. ",KIRK
Neck snapped clean. ,MCCOY
Let's get a closer look at it before the phaser stun wears off.,KIRK
I'm sick of hearing that word can't. Get that ship out of there. ,KIRK
I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us. ",SPOCK
Most curious. ,SPOCK
"Spock, you obviously don't understand  SPOCK: Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept  KIRK: Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war.",MCCOY
Is that your best recommendation?,KIRK
"I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn. ",MCCOY
"Companion, you do not have the power to create life. ",SPOCK
"Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac.",SPOCK
Forget precision. Will it work? ,KIRK
And I have to get back to my ship and figure out how I'm going to enter all this in my log. Tom. Martha. ,KIRK
"You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"You haven't won, Trelane. ",KIRK
Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our ship? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation? ",KIRK
How much have you learned? ,KIRK
"Everyone, including yourself. ",KIRK
"The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. ",SPOCK
Plasus is not the whole government. ,KIRK
It looks right. ,MCCOY
It would appear someone is curious about us.,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place where we can care for her. ,KIRK
"With no past, no future. ",SPOCK
Your friends out there are good. They'll have to destroy this ship to win. ,KIRK
"It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.",SPOCK
Answers it very well. ,MCCOY
By any man aboard. Listen carefully. Science Officer. ,KIRK
Acknowledged. Transporter Room. Beam damage control party aboard. ,SPOCK
"Sure it's wise, Jim? ",MCCOY
But how do they keep the line going? ,MCCOY
"No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do. Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend is back. ",SPOCK
Is it supposed to do that? ,MCCOY
You heard my orders. ,KIRK
I want him unconscious for a while. (Dehner sedates him) ,KIRK
"Yes, well, that may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment. ",KIRK
I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position. So far. ,SPOCK
"Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further demonstration of M-5's capability. ",SPOCK
"Negative, Captain. The Klingon ship has simply moved into contact range. She is pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed and on a parallel course. ",SPOCK
"May I have them, please? ",SPOCK
Thanks Jim. It's good to have a friend like you. ,SPOCK
Approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it.,SPOCK
The electric eye. We've grown too small to make it work. ,KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
Interesting. An Arcturian Macbeth. ,KIRK
Sickbay. What did you do to her? ,KIRK
"Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet. We only received her radio report last month. ",KIRK
"Well then what's the use? We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive. We might not be able to save anything, including this ship! You haven't heard a word I've said. All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk. ",MCCOY
"If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C. ",SPOCK
"Oh, about another thirty minutes. I've come across some most interesting organic compounds. Hey, Starfleet was right. ",MCCOY
"Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart. ",MCCOY
"Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative. ",SPOCK
About our patient. ,MCCOY
"All sections report ready, sir. ",SPOCK
Try me. ,KIRK
We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship. They mean nothing to us. ,KIRK
There is a grid. It may be another communications device. But that seems redundant. ,SPOCK
"That's a very interesting theory. The yellow civilisation is almost destroyed, the white civilisation is destroyed. Keep working on the window if we're ever going to regain our freedom. ",KIRK
"Sir, I do have duties to perform. ",SPOCK
"She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed. And McCoy  SPOCK: Is the random element. ",KIRK
"Which you sold to a thousand inhabitants, who immediately became ill from using it. ",KIRK
"You used a Vendorian, which, I might add, is also a violation of the treaty. ",KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
By whose order? ,KIRK
And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing. ,KIRK
"Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
Correct. Which would seem to be impossible. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we have another problem.",KIRK
Mister Spock. I was just thinking. ,KIRK
We do not intend to die. ,KIRK
"You've made your point, Doctor. ",KIRK
Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action. ,KIRK
"Just leave us alone, Mister Earp. That's all we ask. ",KIRK
"Negative, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I do. ,KIRK
We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator.,SPOCK
"This is of great scientific importance, Captain. We're actually passing through ripples in time. ",SPOCK
Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching. ,KIRK
I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached. ,KIRK
But obviously no more consideration. ,KIRK
"Never mind. Spock, can you fill in for Sulu and Uhura? ",KIRK
"Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour  SPOCK: I have my own will, Captain. Let me help. ",MCCOY
"Your, your terms are unfair. ",KIRK
Come. ,KIRK
All right. We can't break out. There must be another way. ,KIRK
Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind? ,SPOCK
"That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does express the thought. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Keep Sulu's attention off that board. ,KIRK
Captain!,SPOCK
"I'll need some time for the computations, Captain. ",SPOCK
"She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another?",KIRK
I shall try. ,SPOCK
Are you all right? ,KIRK
"That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it? ",KIRK
Thank you. And thank you for taking care of Doctor McCoy. ,KIRK
It's a simple technique. It goes way back. Way back. ,KIRK
That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps it died of the disease the girl's talking about. ,MCCOY
"I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford? ",KIRK
"Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience. ",SPOCK
"A more important question, gentlemen, is whether or not there's a way out of here. A force field. It seems harmless enough. ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
Analysis of disputed area? ,KIRK
"As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place. ",SPOCK
Negative.,SPOCK
"Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay. ",KIRK
"Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain. ",SPOCK
Bele. The chase is finished. ,KIRK
"At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very scientific. ",SPOCK
"Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation. ",SPOCK
Who are you? ,KIRK
I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out.,KIRK
"Very well, Mister Spock. Anything else on your mind? ",KIRK
"The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high, and The body functions will race many times their normal metabolism, so we're going to have to monitor this very carefully. ",MCCOY
"Mister Chekov, resume heading eight eight three mark four one. ",SPOCK
"Course of the missile, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
What did you do? ,KIRK
"It would seem so. Commodore, this is my problem. I'd appreciate it if no one left the bridge. ",KIRK
I will not surrender my ship. ,KIRK
"We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done. ",MCCOY
"Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not? ",KIRK
"Oh, those orders. Well, there wasn't time. We never had a chance to listen to them. ",MCCOY
"It's a class M planet, gravity Earth normal, atmosphere Earth normal. There is no previous information available except that which the survey ship logged before her crew left her. ",SPOCK
Like you were at Cestus Three?,KIRK
You mean you don't know whether you're going to be able to recover the Captain or not? ,MCCOY
"Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the Klingons have been sighted in this sector. While we're negotiating down there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here. ",KIRK
"War is never imperative, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Warp factor one, Captain.  ",SPOCK
(showing his phaser) You've seen how these work. ,KIRK
Good.,SPOCK
"Harry, Harry, you'll never get away with it. ",KIRK
"Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis. ",SPOCK
No one can guarantee the actions of another. ,SPOCK
"I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her! ",KIRK
"Doctor McCoy, I order you to return with us. ",KIRK
Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.,MCCOY
I said no tricks after we reach the ship. You're a prisoner of the Federation of Planets against which you may or may not have committed an act of war. ,KIRK
Very short. ,KIRK
"Tell the court, please, Captain Kirk. Would you say that since Salem, humans have changed? ",SPOCK
"By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables. ",MCCOY
I don't know that yet either.,MCCOY
Two hours of oxygen left.,KIRK
When does he get hungry? ,KIRK
"Ready to beam up, Captain. I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness. ",MCCOY
"No, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I didn't say that exactly. ",SPOCK
"If I may explain, Captain. She refers to the tape storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place. I scan it. A most impressive store. ",SPOCK
After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two. ,SPOCK
Full warp power on my order. Now. ,SPOCK
Somewhere. I'm not certain. ,MCCOY
Kirk to Bridge. Scotty? ,KIRK
Go. ,KIRK
Where do you think you're going? ,MCCOY
Reset. Energise. ,SPOCK
I am not Herbert. ,SPOCK
"Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine. ",MCCOY
What for? ,MCCOY
That is very unlike the captain. ,SPOCK
Emergency reverse power. ,KIRK
"Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only your urging her on caused her to continue. ",SPOCK
Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.,SPOCK
"Well, switch to by-pass circuits. ",KIRK
"If we could locate the Keeper, he could save us a lot of time. ",KIRK
Why not? What's happened? ,KIRK
This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay.,MCCOY
I'd rather not put it on the speaker. ,MCCOY
"We'll do our best. Start feeding us constant status reports, Scotty. Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level twenty three, checkpoint Tiger. Kirk out. ",KIRK
You did that to me deliberately. ,SPOCK
You saw what it did to Uhura. ,KIRK
Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children. ,KIRK
"I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the Captain's status. ",SPOCK
"Let me guess. You want, you'll want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them. And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet. Then we'll sit down and talk, right? ",KIRK
"As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports. ",KIRK
"Restful. After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a place this beautiful exists. ",KIRK
"Too risky. He controls the fortress phaser bank, and they're set on kill. No, it has to be on his terms. Spock, how long since you've worked out in null-gravity combat exercises? ",KIRK
"No more climbing heights for you, Nurse. Got that clear? ",KIRK
Your findings? ,KIRK
"Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet. ",SPOCK
What in the name of? ,MCCOY
"By what, Commodore Stone? ",KIRK
But I am your creator. ,KIRK
Countermand alarm. All engines full stop.,SPOCK
Can you take us to their village while it's still dark? ,KIRK
"Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!",SPOCK
"Where to, Captain? ",SPOCK
There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology.,SPOCK
That is essentially it. ,MCCOY
His biological functions have ceased. ,KIRK
Or a communicator. It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty. ,MCCOY
"Everything's secure here. Maintain position. If everything goes according to plan, you can beam us up in ten minutes. If you don't hear from us, carry out General Order Twenty Four on schedule. ",KIRK
It will of course have to be left behind. ,SPOCK
The power came on. ,KIRK
(standing next to the symbols) Kirk to Enterprise. (and drops suddenly out of our sight) ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, aim for the propulsion units of the lead Romulan vessel. Prepare to fire phasers and photon torpedoes in combination. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, Captain. ",SPOCK
Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector. ,SPOCK
Wait! Unlock us. Set us free! ,KIRK
Get to the point. ,KIRK
Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated. ,SPOCK
There are almost a million inhabitants of Deneva. There's more than one hundred thousand in this city alone. Where is everyone? ,KIRK
"I don't have a few minutes, Bones. Maybe none of us do. Let's go.",KIRK
I beg you. ,MCCOY
"Spock, I want all hands at their stations. We're going to run a complete systems check from bow to stern and get to the bottom of this.",KIRK
"Are you a student of history, sir? ",SPOCK
"Who are you, Sargon? ",KIRK
"This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time. ",SPOCK
What is it in you humans  SCOTT: Never mind. ,SPOCK
From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a remarkable culture this is. ,SPOCK
"Captain, are you all right? You sound tired.",SPOCK
"In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her? ",KIRK
"This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago. ",SPOCK
"We're interested in you, Harry. For fraud, illegal drug manufacture and swindling. ",KIRK
The virus you need is very rare. Who will provide it? ,KIRK
"A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise. ",KIRK
You don't agree with Mister Spock? ,KIRK
"I don't understand what's going on here. This goes against every principle that John Gill ever believed in. Our only chance is to see him, and quickly. ",KIRK
I thought you lived alone. ,KIRK
It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery. ,SPOCK
Can we beam the captain and Spock back up? ,MCCOY
Magnolias in blossom. Beautiful. ,MCCOY
Manned Moon shot? That was in the late 1960s. ,KIRK
Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away. ,KIRK
"What's the matter, Jim? ",MCCOY
Neither have I. ,SPOCK
What about Korob? ,KIRK
We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here. ,KIRK
"Why, Mister Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles. ",KIRK
"You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor. ",KIRK
Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate. ,KIRK
"Hi, Jim. ",MCCOY
"To coin a phrase, fascinating. ",MCCOY
Yeah. We're ready to make the hit. We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready. ,KIRK
"Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the intruder? ",KIRK
"Jim, I don't think anybody's in there. ",MCCOY
"Thank you, Mister Spock. (into communicator) Scotty, you can mark this vein as confirmed. Inform Starfleet I recommend that they dispatch a survey vessel immediately. ",KIRK
If you had listened to me  CLAYMARE: We must be sure you are not harmed. ,KIRK
"Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless. ",SPOCK
"What's the imposed course, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Explain. ,KIRK
"Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects. ",SPOCK
Keep calm. ,KIRK
"We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us. Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive. ",SPOCK
"Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan? ",SPOCK
"Later, Bones. (pushes one nearly as big as himself off his chair)",KIRK
Keep trying to raise them. ,KIRK
More symbols. Can you read them? ,KIRK
"I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me. ",KIRK
"Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor.",SPOCK
We need both the matter and the antimatter engines regenerated. ,KIRK
For years.,KIRK
"There's an inscription, several languages. ",KIRK
"Aren't you getting a little out of line, Mister Spock? My personal business,  SPOCK: Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship. ",KIRK
Go to manual override. ,KIRK
What happened to Spock? ,KIRK
"A very meritorious idea, Captain. ",SPOCK
It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them? ,KIRK
"I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx. ",SPOCK
"Kukulkan, can't you control one of your own creatures? ",KIRK
"On my way. Mister Spock, you have the conn.",KIRK
"Then good day, and thank you for the presents. ",KIRK
And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on  BAILEY: The cube's range and position. I'll have it by then. Raising my voice back there doesn't mean I was scared or couldn't do my job. It means I happen to have a human thing called an adrenaline gland.,SPOCK
"No, it doesn't. It's still a fancy way of saying that you're playing a hunch. well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead or alive and I still want another search. ",MCCOY
"Belay that, Mister Scott. Yes, sir? ",KIRK
"Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son. ",KIRK
Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past. ,KIRK
Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time. ,MCCOY
"No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function.",SPOCK
"Rizzo's alive, barely. ",SPOCK
Captain Kirk. ,KIRK
Except the red rings on his face. ,MCCOY
Speculate. ,KIRK
I must ask you to let us go back to our ship. ,KIRK
What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians? ,KIRK
Academic. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Spock. Spock! ,KIRK
"You said something about the Grups doing bad things, yelling, hurting, burning. ",KIRK
Energise.,KIRK
"No, not everything. That spot, I spilt acid there a year ago.",MCCOY
Go to alert status four. Begin long-range scanning. Kirk out.,KIRK
"I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find the Captain. ",SPOCK
"Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed (passes out, the other one wakes up) ",KIRK
"Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A strong jump on all wavelengths. ",SPOCK
That's strange. Repeat the call. ,KIRK
Don't tell me you've got a feeling. ,MCCOY
"Emergency manual monitor, report. ",KIRK
"I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more. ",SPOCK
I don't like the way he orders her around. ,KIRK
"Helmsman, stabilise position.",KIRK
"I, argh, I don't know.",KIRK
"I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question. ",MCCOY
"Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours. ",SPOCK
Good. ,SPOCK
"There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard. ",KIRK
"Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet? ",SPOCK
"It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life indiscriminately,  GAETANO: The majority. ",SPOCK
Ahead slow. Impulse power only. ,KIRK
Go on. Block off this section. Hurry. I'll find it. ,KIRK
Ship's course? ,KIRK
Oh. I'm sorry. (he kisses it) Is that better? ,KIRK
Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room! ,KIRK
"Oh? Well, follow it.",KIRK
"I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about the grain, Bones? ",KIRK
I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective. ,KIRK
"(picking up two stoned to illustrate his point) Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain. ",SPOCK
You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've treated them for it. You're a murderer many times over. ,KIRK
"Where are you, Spock? ",MCCOY
We must've missed each other somehow. ,KIRK
"Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Well, that's that. ",MCCOY
"There will be other opportunities, Mister Markel. I have just received their final telepathic message. ",SPOCK
"Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do violence? ",SPOCK
"I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial bigotry. Most distasteful. ",SPOCK
"Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ",SPOCK
"Speed is essential, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
"Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in.",KIRK
Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.,SPOCK
"How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you have. This thing you call language though, most remarkable. You depend on it for so very much. But is any one of you really its master? But most of all, the aloneness.",SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott beam us up. ,KIRK
"The force field is gone, Captain. M-5 is neutralised. ",SPOCK
"I have already begun investigation into that possibility, Captain. ",SPOCK
How does he know that? ,KIRK
"Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own. ",SPOCK
"No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I'm aware of that. If we could only win its confidence.",KIRK
Where do we find him? ,KIRK
"Matt, where's your crew? ",KIRK
I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out.,KIRK
"All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots. ",MCCOY
Captain? ,SPOCK
"We are ready, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Jim, if we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts doing back in our universe? ",MCCOY
"Yes, Commodore. ",KIRK
This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine. ,SPOCK
"What about the Enterprise, Jim. Scotty could get worried. He could beam down a fighting force. ",MCCOY
About what? ,KIRK
"Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference? ",KIRK
Remarkable. ,SPOCK
Further instructions? ,SPOCK
Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship. ,SPOCK
"No, we are stronger. I'll prove it to you. Can you harm a man that you're programmed to serve? ",KIRK
"Lieutenant, what are you staring at? ",KIRK
I understand you gave up a career in bio-research to sign aboard a starship.,KIRK
"Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here. There are no Scalosians. ",KIRK
"Quite a woman, eh, Childress? ",KIRK
"Promised? Parmen? He'd let us beam up to the Enterprise, and plunge the ship back into the atmosphere. ",KIRK
And Professor Crater and wife? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to transporter control centre on the planet. ",KIRK
"Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity. ",SPOCK
"Crewman Green, report! Green! Green, where are you? Could it be Crater? He came this way. ",MCCOY
Are you? (Spock nods),KIRK
The K3 indicator registers the level of pain. Watch as I turn it on. That's what he's been going through. I've never seen anything like it. No wonder the poor devils go mad. ,MCCOY
"Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney. ",SPOCK
"That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg. ",KIRK
Fire! ,KIRK
I see. ,SPOCK
"You have endangered all of us by your actions, and you have forced us to interfere with the natives of a planet that deserves prime directive protection. ",KIRK
Try inverse phasing. ,SPOCK
Incredible. ,MCCOY
What are you doing to her? ,SPOCK
Deck two. It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger. It was not intentional. All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device. ,SPOCK
Keep him until I send for him. We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale. So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop. ,KIRK
Biology. ,SPOCK
Yes. There are thirty eight of them. ,KIRK
They picked a fine representative. ,KIRK
Well somebody certainly did. ,KIRK
"Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit station, and put it on scramble. ",KIRK
How much time before the youngest crew member returns to the time of birth? ,KIRK
No! No! (he sits up) ,SPOCK
"Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory. ",SPOCK
"We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely. ",SPOCK
Then tell him. ,MCCOY
"Go on, Trelane. Look at it. It's over. Your power is blanked out.",KIRK
Deflector shields at full power. They can't take much more of this. ,SPOCK
Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone on board? This is the Captain. ,KIRK
"It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest. Maybe he can provide some answers. ",KIRK
"I intend to stay on this ship, with these people, whatever happens. ",MCCOY
"Well I want to know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes? ",KIRK
Then come. ,MCCOY
Yes. ,KIRK
"It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to communicate. ",SPOCK
Very good. (he tries a grape) Excellent. ,KIRK
"Got any miracles in your computer, Spock? ",KIRK
"I register no life readings at all, sir. ",SPOCK
"Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have. ",SPOCK
Well. ,KIRK
"Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? ",SPOCK
"It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be. ",SPOCK
"Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image like you? He already looks up to you. ",MCCOY
Curious. Most illogical. ,SPOCK
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's giving out again. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking officer  KIRK: No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher. I order you to take command. ,SPOCK
Feminine. No doubt about it. ,KIRK
Do these clothes look like yours? ,KIRK
Let's see it. ,KIRK
"Life forms, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room. ,KIRK
Being in one piece is very natural where we come from. ,MCCOY
"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty. ",MCCOY
"Bones, I'm a busy man. ",KIRK
"(in pain) I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn. Just hurry, please. ",KIRK
"You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mister Khan. This is a social occasion. ",KIRK
"Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them? ",MCCOY
"You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics. ",SPOCK
It's been too long. Jim should have at least signaled by now. ,MCCOY
Jim. Jim! May we please have a word with you? ,MCCOY
"At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Where'd they go? ,MCCOY
"First officer of the Enterprise. (Broken-hearted, she slaps his face.) What is your present form of execution?",SPOCK
"Reduce speed to warp factor two, Mister Walking Bear. ",KIRK
"Yes. I shall tend to it, Major. ",SPOCK
Sickbay to transporter room. ,MCCOY
Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out. ,KIRK
Vulcans do not approve of violence. ,SPOCK
Rough ride? ,KIRK
Who are the Others? ,KIRK
Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it. ,SPOCK
"The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out. ",SPOCK
"How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life? Will we allow it, gentlemen? ",MCCOY
Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon. ,KIRK
"Donald, good to see you. ",KIRK
Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside. ,SPOCK
"Nor I a work of art, madam. ",SPOCK
"Yes, the irritation would be gone. ",KIRK
"Long range sensor scan, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible. ,MCCOY
"Yes, for McCoy's sake. And for Kol-Tai's sake too. You see, Commander, we do place a value on life. All life. Does that shock you, Commander? ",KIRK
How does it work? Show us! We'll protect you. ,KIRK
How have you been? ,KIRK
"It's a native of Capella Four, isn't it? ",KIRK
"Tell him, Spock. ",MCCOY
What happened? ,KIRK
Yes. We'd be glad to. We don't want to fight. ,KIRK
"I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case, Captain. ",SPOCK
I'm sending him back. ,KIRK
"Good work, Spock. ",KIRK
Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy? ,SPOCK
"All personnel, away from helm area. Go to the far bulkhead. ",KIRK
"If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is, Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer. ",SPOCK
"And again, check. ",SPOCK
Think Spock can take him? ,KIRK
Number one on our list of things to do. ,MCCOY
To be killed? ,KIRK
My patient spattered me with a rock. She's gone. ,MCCOY
"At this point, my medical log remains open. ",MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out.",KIRK
"The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation, and engineering functions. ",SPOCK
Traces? ,KIRK
"Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"How do you feel, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get cracking. ",MCCOY
Young man  BOY: You going to hit Krako out here? You open up and you'll be scragged from every window in the street. I can fix it for ya. ,SPOCK
"Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion.",SPOCK
That too is a possibility. ,SPOCK
What happened? ,KIRK
Did you inject that beast or yourself? ,MCCOY
Ready. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency. ",KIRK
You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. ,MCCOY
"Spock, what is this? ",KIRK
Just a minute  METRON [OC]: There will be no discussion. It is done. ,KIRK
"All right, but he'll double over before we get very far. (Spock and Kirk take McCoy's arms.) ",KIRK
"I felt for him, too. ",SPOCK
Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk. ,SPOCK
"All systems report normal, Captain. ",SPOCK
They hate captivity. You try to put more than one hand on them and they throw off a charge of two thousand volts. How did you ever capture it? ,MCCOY
"No, Jim! ",SPOCK
"Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy. ",SPOCK
Look at me. Look at me. What do you see? ,KIRK
"Scotty, any records, log books of any kind? ",KIRK
Captain Garth  GARTH: Lord Garth! ,KIRK
How long have you been alone? Are you lonely? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. Mrs. April, you're about to see another of the galaxy's most beautiful sights, the Beta Niobe's supernova. ",KIRK
You are stopping this? You? ,KIRK
That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt. ,KIRK
Bridge to Captain. ,SPOCK
Something is shaking us apart. ,KIRK
"All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.",KIRK
Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go. ,KIRK
"Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady. ",KIRK
"Scotty, are you there? ",KIRK
Sonny! Wait a moment. What have they done? What have they done to you? What have you done? ,KIRK
Total senility? ,KIRK
Beam up immediately. ,SPOCK
These look real. ,MCCOY
Our universe. ,KIRK
I got a better idea. This planet has to be united. You know that.,KIRK
Checkmate. ,SPOCK
"Excuse me, Captain. You asked to be notified when we made visual contact with the Beta Niobe nova. ",SPOCK
Impossible. ,KIRK
"Cut power, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, we must restore communications with the landing party. ",SPOCK
"Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out. Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly. She'll be sluggish on response. ",KIRK
"(dictating into PADD) The Enterprise is heading out of our galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship.",KIRK
What's that? Are you all right? ,KIRK
You speculate. ,KIRK
"Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time. ",KIRK
"Well, I think we'd better tell Jim. ",MCCOY
"Its skeleton is similar to that of a Denebian whale, Captain. ",SPOCK
"The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose their mates? Haven't you wondered? ",SPOCK
That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters? ,KIRK
Could you turn up the heat? ,MCCOY
"Through the centre of things, Doctor. Through what may be the centre of everything. ",SPOCK
Now get back to Sickbay. Go on. ,KIRK
"Neither can I. I admit it looks harmless. It probably is harmless. But before I bring my people down here, I want proof it's harmless.",KIRK
"What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam, come ashore? ",KIRK
"This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two hundred years ago. ",KIRK
"As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards. ",SPOCK
From Ekos? ,KIRK
What caused it? ,KIRK
"All right, I'll listen. What are you telling? ",KIRK
Jim! Jim! ,MCCOY
Everything. ,KIRK
Scotty! ,MCCOY
We apologise for intruding. We did not realise the situation. We will leave. We will tell others of our kind not to bother you here. ,KIRK
"(handing the girl over to Sulu) Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for.",SPOCK
"Because we have minds, we can't be what you wanted us to be. If we fail or succeed, it has to be our own doing. Intelligent life is too precious a thing to be led by the nose. ",KIRK
"She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world. ",SPOCK
Who is Landru? ,SPOCK
Doctor McCoy. ,KIRK
I was curious to see how they appeared.,SPOCK
"Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings? ",KIRK
Thank you. ,MCCOY
Full reverse thrust. ,KIRK
"Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on? ",SPOCK
Then why do you want to kill me? ,KIRK
Why? ,KIRK
Keep trying. ,KIRK
It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.,KIRK
"Earth's not there. At least, not the Earth we know. We're totally alone.",KIRK
"Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing. ",MCCOY
Open all channels. Captain to crew. Repairs are now being effected by Mister Spock. The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately. ,KIRK
We overcame our instinct for violence.  ,KIRK
"You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford. Whatever that thing is outside, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit.",KIRK
"Nobody but us chickens, Doctor.",KIRK
"It was my duty, Spock. ",SPOCK
"That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course. ",SPOCK
Well? ,KIRK
"We'll get you out, Bones. ",KIRK
"It can't be helped, Scotty. ",KIRK
"We hear you perfectly, Captain. ",SPOCK
I don't need textbooks to know you could've promoted him too fast. Listen to that voice.,MCCOY
It'd be a shame if that happened. ,KIRK
Kirk to boarding party. ,KIRK
(into intercom) Captain Kirk. Spock here.,SPOCK
It's also keeping you prisoner. ,KIRK
Get out of here. ,KIRK
Dead?,SPOCK
It's too late for threats. You let me contact the ship. How long do you think it will it be before a search party arrives? ,KIRK
"Thank you. This is the captain speaking. Flight deck, prepare Columbus for immediate exit, for a search of the planet surface.",KIRK
How do you feel? ,MCCOY
"I thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive, captured if possible. ",KIRK
I assure you I am quite sane. ,SPOCK
Enterprise to Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"You tell him, buster. Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life! ",MCCOY
Are you sure? ,KIRK
Doctor Dehner? ,KIRK
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
"Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire Cat? ",KIRK
"Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe. ",SPOCK
"Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life. ",MCCOY
Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted. ,SPOCK
"Korob, that door won't last. ",KIRK
"Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations  KIRK: I know the regulations against the killing of intelligent life forms, Mister Spock. But we don't know this life form is intelligent.",SPOCK
"Now more than ever, I wish to search through the universe to find a cure for myself and others like me. And I want you to be with me. ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live. ",SPOCK
"Agreed, Captain. Tribbles appear to be a much more effective weapon. ",SPOCK
He said there's always that possibility. And that's not like Bones at all. Come on. ,KIRK
Hard to believe it ever happened. ,KIRK
I am Spock. ,SPOCK
"So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting. ",KIRK
"A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say. ",SPOCK
Beam up. ,KIRK
Fire. ,KIRK
"You're very good at making speeches, Parmen. Just make sure that this one sinks in. Now move aside. Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise.",KIRK
"If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made. ",SPOCK
"Yes, but you can do better than that. There's still not enough sport in just killing me with a sword. ",KIRK
"Captain, that could be exactly what they want us to do. Tow the robot and limit our available power. We're carrying the extra mass of the first ship's cargo, and now we have the second one in tow. That requires a great deal of power we won't be able to use in battle. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Bones. ",KIRK
Enterprise. Spock here. ,SPOCK
"Increasing tiredness, steadily decreasing efficiency, all the symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. Kind of like the test you had to pass back at the Academy. ",MCCOY
You got a better idea? ,KIRK
"We're stuck with it, Mister Spock. We'll have to make do with what we've got. ",KIRK
It would be a great prize. ,SPOCK
What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly? ,KIRK
What's so fascinating?,KIRK
"Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further? ",KIRK
"Hold position. Analysis, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't operate without transfusions from Spock. I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here. As soon as he leaves the bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters. Will that fill your prescription?",KIRK
I've already got a female to worry about. Her name's the Enterprise.,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty. ,KIRK
"No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead. ",SPOCK
"But, Captain  KIRK: You have your orders. ",MCCOY
"Everything's all right, Mister Spock, for us. ",KIRK
How long to repair warp drive? ,KIRK
"I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Stand by. All hands, this is the captain. We are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force. We're going to apply  [Sickbay]",KIRK
Fire phasers. ,KIRK
"I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would.",SPOCK
I've got to go. ,KIRK
"Sorry, Commander. Your ship is, er, impounded. ",KIRK
Wouldn't know this was a spaceship. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
The rest?,SPOCK
"Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless. ",SPOCK
"All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red. ",KIRK
"If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a statement that you were marooned here. It's a long way off the beaten path. ",KIRK
Have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes? ,KIRK
"Scotty, assist. ",KIRK
"Full security, Johnson, on the double. ",KIRK
"That doesn't answer my question, sir. Why did all your animals die? ",KIRK
"Is this a dead man, Doctor? ",SPOCK
Get down to emergency manual control. Try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power. ,KIRK
"Well, we're certainly going to try. The infection is massive.",MCCOY
"I think you've got it reversed, Mister Krako. ",KIRK
"The crew's descendants may still be living, Captain. ",SPOCK
"At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties. ",SPOCK
"Acknowledge. This is the captain. Scotty, acknowledge.",KIRK
"It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor? ",KIRK
"A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe. Beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon. An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club. Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them. Where?",KIRK
Kirk out.,KIRK
What in blazes is that? ,MCCOY
I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning. ,SPOCK
Now it's up to the captain. ,MCCOY
Cancel Red Alert. We'll beam right down. ,KIRK
"There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor. ",SPOCK
You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture. ,KIRK
"The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered. ",SPOCK
Johnson! ,KIRK
Readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis.,SPOCK
We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter. ,SPOCK
Trial? You mean kangaroo court. I've heard about Dramian justice.,KIRK
"Allow me to test the water first, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"No. I don't want anyone else to see the  SPOCK: Captain, you ordered me to tell you. ",KIRK
Something's wrong. ,MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel. Mister Spock and I are transporting aboard. Mister Scott, you have the conn. ",KIRK
But who would have the technology to build a ship that could travel at such a speed? ,KIRK
Inform me when transport is complete. ,KIRK
"It is spectacular, isn't it? ",KIRK
Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. ,SPOCK
Why don't you try your Vulcan nerve pinch. ,KIRK
There must be some defence we can use. ,KIRK
"Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu? ",SPOCK
A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Love, for one thing. ",KIRK
"Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet. ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant, hailing frequencies. ",KIRK
"Magnification ten, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally normally except his memory. ,MCCOY
"Is there something I can do for you, Captain? ",SPOCK
"You cannot succeed, Commodore. Your only logical alternative is to return to the ship. ",SPOCK
"Agreed. Take us into orbit, Lieutenant Arex. ",KIRK
Look at this stuff. ,MCCOY
"What is it, Scotty? ",KIRK
That's an unusual request. ,SPOCK
What do you want? What are you doing here? ,KIRK
"Ahead warp factor one, Mister Leslie.",KIRK
"Maybe he could be retrained, reeducated. ",MCCOY
"It worked! We can do it. What's the matter, Jim? We can do it. ",MCCOY
"Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart. ",SPOCK
Then we can't wait any longer. Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship. ,KIRK
Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order. ,KIRK
"Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in. Kirk out. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"All in good time, Captain. Meanwhile, let me apologise for bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly, but it couldn't be helped.",KIRK
"I don't think we're going to have time to isolate it, Bones. ",KIRK
What are you doing about it? ,KIRK
Superstition. ,KIRK
Spock. ,KIRK
Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony. ,SPOCK
"Engineering, status report. Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
Affirmative. The dysfunction is more severe than I thought.,SPOCK
It exists on the hate of others. ,KIRK
I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error. ,SPOCK
"The Captain of a ship, no matter his rank, must follow the book. ",KIRK
"No, he's not. ",SPOCK
"There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and irritable. They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping. ",MCCOY
"And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations, gather data for computer banks. Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio. ",KIRK
"Helm, hard over. Phasers, fire point-blank. ",KIRK
"Is there any way we can help you, Sargon? ",KIRK
Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you might like to meet her. ,KIRK
"Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands? ",SPOCK
"So that if anything went wrong, you would be the one to blame. ",MCCOY
Not until my order. ,SPOCK

"Thank you, Doctor Adams. ",KIRK
Kirk to bridge. Scanning report. ,KIRK
Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder. You want to make sure they all know about it! ,MCCOY
Precisely. ,SPOCK
"I've just picked up readings for our own people, sir. ",KIRK
How long have they been down there now? ,MCCOY
Yes. Like a door opening. ,KIRK
"First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be an occasion like this.",MCCOY
Oh yes I did. ,MCCOY
Take it easy. ,KIRK
All right. We're here at your invitation. Would you mind telling us what you want without all the Olympian generalities? ,KIRK

That's me. Didn't she mention I was here? ,MCCOY
"Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration? ",SPOCK
I'm afraid not. ,SPOCK
"According to Federation records, this is the first. ",SPOCK

"One final order, Engineer Scott. If we do not return, the Enterprise must not be taken. If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves. Is that clear? ",KIRK
"Captain, it was not a storm. ",SPOCK
Are you out of your mind? (grabs Mudd by the throat) You can't beam down an entire crew of a spaceship. Somebody has to be on board. ,KIRK

Bones. ,KIRK
But where are they? ,KIRK

Bones, are you aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries?

"Your orders, Jim. You're the last one. ",MCCOY
"Wilson, give me your phaser. ",KIRK
"Far too close, Captain. I appreciate your action on my behalf, but your first duty is to the group and the mission. ",SPOCK
"Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement. ",SPOCK
Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am? ,KIRK
"I am Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my medical officer, Doctor McCoy. My first officer, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Very good. Have the transporter room stand by. ,KIRK
"Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while. The Argelians will be the first to panic. Let's get back to the briefing room. ",KIRK
We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done. ,MCCOY
From where? Can you trace it? ,KIRK
"Inscrutable? Sulu, you're the most scrutable man I know. ",KIRK
"But Commander Bem's difficulty appears to be genuine. Phasers or not, we have to rescue him. We're going to have to follow them. ",KIRK
"If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge. ",SPOCK
Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship? ,KIRK
"Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells.",SPOCK
"No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
Any indication of danger from it?,KIRK
"Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a rock) He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out.",SPOCK
"Yes, I think you might. Turn in your glass slippers. The ball is over. ",KIRK
Terminal. ,MCCOY
"Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished. ",KIRK
"Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my behalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success. Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since  KIRK: Eighteen hours and twelve minutes. ",SPOCK
"Captain, the power reading now includes an electronic probe. We are being scanned. ",SPOCK
"Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's boring. Adjusting the translator will give you something to do. ",KIRK
Tribbles. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation. ,SPOCK
"Captain, I found this device on my console. It seems to serve no useful function, and  (When he lifts his face from the eye pieces, of course there are rings around his eyes and laughter from the crew) ",SPOCK
It will take too long to do a comprehensive scan. I want a landing party to at least beam down to the last known co-ordinates the other crew used. ,KIRK
What success did you have? ,KIRK
And it becomes Nancy for you. ,KIRK
That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before. ,KIRK
"Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered. ",SPOCK
From the Federation. ,KIRK
I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me. ,SPOCK
And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors. My assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man. How long it would take him to pass out from the pain. ,MCCOY
Those words are familiar. Wait a moment. ,KIRK
"Bones, hurry with that report. Join me in the briefing room with your analysis. ",KIRK
What? ,MCCOY
"Now wait, wait. ",KIRK
It's not an arbitrary decision on my part. I have my orders. ,KIRK
"Bones, answer me! Bones, what is it?",KIRK
"Yes, Elaan. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, report to the Bridge. ",KIRK
"You mean we're trapped here? No communication, nothing? ",MCCOY
But that's impossible. ,KIRK
How long can Spock last without the drug? ,KIRK
Any theories about what it is? ,KIRK
There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be sent?,KIRK
In this building? ,KIRK
"We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there is no motive for violence._ GELDER: Where's the captain? Which one of you is the captain?",SPOCK

"This Festival, it starts at six o'clock? ",KIRK
"I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor. These Organians  SPOCK: They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar. ",KIRK
"What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference? ",KIRK
"Yes, I think I do. I don't know how I know, but home is where it fought a starship once before. Ito Uhura) Inform them of our tactical situation and inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature. We will rendezvous. Round-trip time, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
Fine. Right now why don't we all eat up before our food gets cold. ,KIRK
Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down. ,SPOCK
Lieutenant Uhura. ,KIRK
"There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind. ",SPOCK
Go to the devil. ,KIRK
How's Ensign Rizzo? ,KIRK
He's disappeared. It's almost as if he dematerialised. ,KIRK
"No, but I'm sure he's all right.",KIRK
"Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation chamber in ten minutes? All dilithium crystals, full power. ",KIRK
Beam us up. ,KIRK
"The Captain states the case emotionally, of course, but correctly. I would be of little value to this ship if I am confined to a tank in Sickbay. I must accompany the Captain. ",SPOCK
"I believe I said that, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Helen! Helen, don't go! I need you, Helen! ",KIRK
He's receiving us alright. ,KIRK
Bones? ,KIRK
You won't persuade me. ,MCCOY
Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather. ,KIRK
I don't know what your job is! You may set those controls so we can't detonate that warhead. ,KIRK
She was on the Enterprise. She must have done it. How did you do it? ,KIRK
"If I were you, I'd think about saving my life. ",KIRK
"Dangerous if lied to, if their customs are violated. We lied to no one, Doctor. We violated no customs. Perhaps you'll explain to me why one of my men is dead. ",KIRK
I'm calling you a babe. ,KIRK
Never mind about us. What's happening up there? ,KIRK
"Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a nice, likable girl. I think we could become friends. It's possible. ",KIRK
"Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage them with a reasonable possibility of victory? ",KIRK
It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon. ,SPOCK
"Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk. ",SPOCK
"And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you.",SPOCK
"No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room.",KIRK
"If you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, Ensign. No weapon known would have made any difference. Then or eleven years ago.",KIRK
"No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the survey vessel SS Beagle. ",SPOCK
You will have that opportunity. ,SPOCK
"Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena. ",MCCOY
Perhaps it did not understand. ,SPOCK
The name of this game.,KIRK
"Damage control reports, all stations! ",SPOCK
The transponders. ,KIRK
I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for a while. ,KIRK
"Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians.",SPOCK
"Yes, I have. One more. And it depends on the lieutenant's loyalty. If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats. ",KIRK
Scotty? ,KIRK
"Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"Spock, not now. ",MCCOY
"Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel  SPOCK: If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. ",KIRK

What happened? ,KIRK
"Vegetation, Captain. Evidently there's water nearby. ",KIRK
"Can we take it, Mister Scott? ",KIRK

Compensate. ,SPOCK

"May I point out, Captain  (Janice struggles with Coleman) ",SPOCK

"Captain, may I ask where you'll be? ",SPOCK
Something out there can't be seen. Explanation? ,KIRK
Or the food could be a lure set by the Others to bring them in here. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?",KIRK
Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense. ,SPOCK
"We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean, drama about to unfold? ",KIRK
It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel. ,SPOCK
Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were inoperative. ,SPOCK

"You're looking good, Doc. ",KIRK
No change. ,MCCOY

What's the matter with me? ,KIRK
Negative. He was examining the flora at the time.,MCCOY
Never seen that in a medical book. ,KIRK
Nothing. Are you locked in on me? ,KIRK

"Yes, I  SPOCK: Captain! ",KIRK

You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.,MCCOY
"However, not exactly safe. ",SPOCK
Governor. ,SPOCK
"Keep pouring it on, Scotty. ",KIRK
Because she approved of you? ,KIRK
Tell the captain what you told me. ,MCCOY
Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here. The only reasonable explanation would be a war.,SPOCK

"Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Providing for all their needs means using thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy [Bridge]",KIRK

"Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions. ",KIRK
Yes. ,MCCOY
"You're in (a squeeze makes him lower his voice) You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat. ",MCCOY
A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal. ,SPOCK
Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles? ,KIRK
Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor. ,KIRK
"His genes. All right, nurse. Prepare Chekov for another complete physical. ",MCCOY
Out of the question. ,KIRK
My tricorder doesn't register it. ,MCCOY
"Three, two, one. Accelerate. ",KIRK
"Doctor Wallace, give him the shot. ",SPOCK
"Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct? ",SPOCK
"Yes, I would agree. That's the case here. ",MCCOY
An android? ,KIRK
You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled. Many lives were lost. ,KIRK
The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have. ,SPOCK
I never stopped you from going on with your space work. ,KIRK
Is that a threat? ,KIRK
Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device? ,KIRK
What happened to him? ,KIRK
They were smart enough to invent these training devices. What a way to maintain control over a man. ,KIRK
I took that chance. I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong. ,KIRK
"That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that. ",KIRK
"Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"Situation, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"All available personnel, on the double. Spock, with me. ",KIRK
Can you locate the intruder for us? ,KIRK
"If I had gotten everything I wanted, you might not walk out of this room alive. ",KIRK
"Good, but we need weapons just as much as we need water, Spock. ",KIRK
"Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What about some logic now? Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?",MCCOY
But you left at the very time mankind needed courage. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning. ",SPOCK
Normal? That thing's trying to tell us nothing has happened. ,MCCOY
"There's no apparent danger, Spock. Let's go. ",KIRK
Precisely. ,SPOCK
It's one of the things we've got to find out. We've got to take a closer look at it. ,MCCOY
"Well, let's get started. ",KIRK
"Keep me posted, Mister Spock. We'll continue our investigation down here. Captain out. ",KIRK
"Wait. If you lead these people now, be certain you make the right decisions. ",KIRK
He froze. One man was killed. Another may die. ,KIRK
Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source of radiation is not from our universe. ,KIRK
"He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mister O'Neil. ",KIRK

"We don't have the time to spare, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Mister Spock. Report to my quarters. I'll contact Captain Christopher. ",KIRK
"Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
It's sad. Think what we could have done with his knowledge. But the price was just too high. ,KIRK
I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature? ,MCCOY
Spock here. ,SPOCK
Compton! ,MCCOY
"Why aren't our sensors picking it up? Forward scanners, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Research is not the Klingon way. ,KIRK
Yes. The Vedala would have informed us if there were any live beings here we should know of. ,SPOCK
You mean it's some kind of a zoo? ,MCCOY
"Without my instruments, it's difficult to make an exact diagnosis. Rough guess is a malarial type infection caused by an insect bite. I can't do anything without my medikit. ",MCCOY
"Very well, sir. ",SPOCK
He is. ,SPOCK
Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun. ,SPOCK

No energy registering. Something's drained them. ,KIRK
But he evidently intended that you continue living. ,SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Magnification eight. What is that? ,KIRK
"This is mutiny, mister. ",KIRK
I see what you mean. ,KIRK
Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment. You know what to do. ,KIRK
It's all right. It's all right. ,KIRK
"Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford. ",KIRK
"There are few in the Federation who wouldn't recognise your face, sir. I'm Captain James Kirk, commanding this vessel. Mister Spock, my first officer, Doctor McCoy, senior medical officer. ",KIRK
"Yes, sir.",SPOCK
"That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim. ",MCCOY
Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded? ,KIRK
"The crew wasn't abducted, they just left.",KIRK
"Give me your hand. Your hand. (she does) Now feel that. Human flesh against human flesh. We're the same. We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives. We're tied together beyond any untying. Man or woman, it makes no difference. We're human. We couldn't escape from each other even if we wanted to. That's how you do it, Lieutenant. By remembering who and what you are. A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end. The only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity. That's where our duty lies. Do you understand me? ",KIRK
"Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more than we can chew. ",KIRK

"I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational. ",SPOCK
"No, I think we'll use a  SULU: Captain, we've checked out everything. It all seems normal, except for the absence of any animals. ",KIRK
"Okay, stand by. ",KIRK
"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise.",KIRK
"That was a pretty real illusion, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me. ",SPOCK
"Helmsman, did you hear me? ",KIRK
But only two. More Organians will die. ,SPOCK
You'll show no further hostility? ,SPOCK
Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require. ,SPOCK
"Bones, take care of him.",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Start a trace-back of all circuits. ,KIRK
Help it? I cured it. ,MCCOY
Kirk of the starship Enterprise. ,KIRK
Apparently our friends learned very quickly. ,SPOCK
"Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds. ",SPOCK
"Can he control it the way he says, Bones? ",KIRK
"On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock. ",SPOCK
I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time. ,SPOCK
Triangulate on this location. ,KIRK
"You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way.",KIRK
I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst. ,KIRK
"I don't know, Jim. Maybe I'm imagining things, and maybe I'm not. You tell me. ",MCCOY
Returned from where? ,KIRK
What we need is more information about Landru. (Reger shakes his head) You said you wanted us to help you. ,KIRK
McCoy to Captain Kirk. Captain's presence for examination is requested. ,MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"We can't give him that worship, none of us can. Especially you. ",KIRK
"Okay, baby. Cool him till I flag you. ",KIRK
My people are not responsible for your agreements. ,KIRK
"Put that away. Landru, listen to me. ",KIRK
"Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you. We will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard. ",SPOCK
"I've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them. ",KIRK
Our boosters. ,SPOCK
Go. ,KIRK
"We'll board her, Mister Spock. Scotty, Bones, you'll come with us. We'll need life-support belts. Mister Sulu, have the Transporter room stand by. ",KIRK
Don't know yet. ,KIRK
"Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet. ",KIRK
"Spock, I don't believe it. There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out. ",MCCOY
All right. ,KIRK
"Trouble in the Engineering core, sir. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Captain? ",SPOCK
We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience. You don't understand what it is to live. Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect. ,KIRK
"Well, I can't give you one, Jim. I've never worked on anyone like him or anything like him. ",MCCOY
"It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine. ",KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. At present, I am rather heavily  (He quickly shuts and hides his communicator as the door opens, and the Commander enters. She is wearing a figure hugging dress.) ",SPOCK
"Come on, Bones. What's the mystery? ",KIRK
"Yes, art is the population's chief occupation. ",KIRK
Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call. What happened? ,KIRK
Why? ,KIRK
"Captain, I don't see how that can be. ",MCCOY
A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody. ,SPOCK
Acknowledged.,KIRK
"I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying  KIRK: Bones! ",MCCOY
It's all right. ,KIRK
"The Klingon seems to be veering off. My mistake, Captain. They were not veering off. They were attacking the grain ship. ",SPOCK
Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.,KIRK
"Trouble, Mister Chekov? ",SPOCK
"But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer. ",KIRK
"And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing. ",SPOCK
"Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk. ",KIRK
Anything missing? ,KIRK
Life support systems? ,KIRK
I popped in out of thin air. ,KIRK
Sound security alert. ,KIRK
"We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain.",SPOCK
I know it can. ,MCCOY
They selected us as the most compatible bodies. ,KIRK
Right forefinger. ,MCCOY
"Tommy, Just a moment. I'd like to ask you a question. Come and sit down. Tommy, will you tell me what you saw? ",KIRK
A what? ,KIRK
Then why are you afraid? (he embraces her) Don't be afraid. ,KIRK
"Exactly in some ways, different in others. ",KIRK
"Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided.",SPOCK
"Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve closure? ",SPOCK
"And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there.",KIRK
No. Not with my Christine. ,SPOCK
"I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead.",KIRK
Affirmative. No answer from the cube.,SPOCK
Come on. ,KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
"Then if you know who we are, you know why we're here, Mister? ",KIRK
We won't be using the impulse engines. Turn the alarm off. ,KIRK
While it lasts. ,MCCOY
"When can we beam down, Spock? ",KIRK
Where did they originate? ,KIRK
There's a relay junction down the corridor. ,SPOCK
Of course. Go right ahead. ,MCCOY
I saw you on my ship. ,KIRK
"You were a man with respect for all things alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps his arm in a door. The skin tears to reveal electronics)",KIRK
Set course for Taurus Two. ,KIRK
"Secure from general quarters. Well done, Mister Sulu. Scotty. ",KIRK
You must be close to the portal. ,SPOCK
Go? ,KIRK
"Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer. You know everything about that ship there is to know. More than the men who designed it. If you can't get those warp engines working  [Bridge]",KIRK
Captain? ,SPOCK
"You do anything you think necessary to protect the ship. Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything. Clear? ",KIRK
"Bones, what have you got for a headache? ",KIRK
"Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people, and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no evidence of this. ",SPOCK
"Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with the other casualties. Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma, shock. They're all healing at a fantastic rate. ",MCCOY
Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared. ,SPOCK
Seal the windows! ,SPOCK
More and more fall injuries coming. Compound fracture. ,MCCOY
"Who cares what started it, Mister Spock. We're in it! Murderers.",MCCOY
"Fact. You said you needed the crystals. Fact. An hour after you said you must have them, they were missing. Fact. Two of my crewmen were attacked. ",KIRK
It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message. ,SPOCK
It isn't your fault. ,MCCOY
Change course. Pursue and overtake. ,KIRK
"Stand by, Mister Sulu. Spock has something. ",KIRK
Commodore? ,SPOCK
But you don't just throw him to the wolves. ,MCCOY
"We have a large supply of entertainment tapes, gentlemen. ",KIRK
That object on the screen? ,KIRK
"Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the tribbles who are breeding. If we don't get them off this ship, we're going to be hip deep in them. ",MCCOY
Reverse course. ,KIRK
So we're going down to recontaminate them. ,MCCOY
"You're beaming cargo down to a penal colony, Mister Berkeley.",KIRK
"I believe I just said that, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
What do you mean? ,KIRK
We've been led here. Why? ,MCCOY
Such as? ,KIRK
"This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be true. (humming noise) ",KIRK
Deep space. Full power. Widest angle of dispersion. Maintain. ,KIRK
Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air's too hot and thin for Kirk.,MCCOY
Go ahead. ,KIRK
Good. ,KIRK
It's good to see you.,MCCOY
Do you think you can make it? ,KIRK
Very good. Commence decontamination procedures when ready. Advise when complete. ,KIRK
"We're not slaves to our starship. We, or men like us, created the Enterprise to carry us through space. ",KIRK
"Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office. ",MCCOY
I said. ,KIRK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want? ,KIRK
"That's our ship calling, Spock. You answer them. ",KIRK
"Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Kirk out. Scotty, you have the conn. ",KIRK
"We can't arrest you, Harry, but you can give yourself up. ",KIRK
"I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy.  ",SPOCK
Back where? ,SPOCK
Who do I have to be? ,KIRK
"Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura. ",SPOCK
The wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium.,SPOCK
"Go, Scott! ",SPOCK
"Sure. We can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice. You know what I mean? He's standing about twelve feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal. ",KIRK
"In the cave, on the planet. On Triacus. ",KIRK
"No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible. ",SPOCK
"I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply could not have done it. ",MCCOY
Mister Kyle. ,SPOCK
"The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact. ",SPOCK
Are we still losing power? ,KIRK
"Just before you disappeared, Captain, I discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron. ",SPOCK
Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions. ,SPOCK
Specify. Point of origin. ,SPOCK
Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused. The guilt. ,KIRK
Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman. Don't let us upset you. ,KIRK
Never mind about me. What about the ship? ,KIRK
"We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry. ",SPOCK
Is that all? ,KIRK
"The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them.",KIRK
"A chance. At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a minute.",MCCOY
What about the others? ,KIRK
"And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up!",KIRK
"This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not the first time. Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat. ",KIRK
Let's see what you have. ,KIRK
So we do. ,KIRK
Spock. Spock? ,KIRK
What bearing? ,KIRK
You're fired. ,KIRK
"Doctor McCoy? All right, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Capellans aren't human, Jim. They're humanoid. There's certain internal differences. I don't have equipment to handle an emergency. ",MCCOY
"Artificial gravity is in effect here, Captain. Both air and gravity within two points of Earth normal. ",SPOCK
"Yes. very well, Captain. ",SPOCK
Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders. ,KIRK
Wait. I can prove we're telling the truth. A small device. I'll take it out slowly. (his communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. ,KIRK
That irregularly shaped object at the top of the core emanates considerable electrical activity. ,SPOCK
"Of course I am. Bones harming other beings. You know better, Spock. I know better. Not Bones. ",KIRK
"I'll have a dish, too. ",KIRK
"Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something you couldn't do yourself!",KIRK
"Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin. ",MCCOY
"By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present. Apparently what he had in mind.",KIRK
"On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe. ",KIRK
"I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me. ",KIRK
A gift? What? ,KIRK
"Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet. ",SPOCK
"Yes, we were, Commodore. ",KIRK
Or something did.,SPOCK
Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there? ,MCCOY
"Doctor, is there something I can do for you? ",KIRK
Engage.,KIRK
Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. Apparently the two universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions. ",SPOCK
Of course. Perhaps I'll see  SPOCK: I'll escort you to your quarters. ,KIRK
We could rest awhile. Lara? ,KIRK
"Jim, listen, if you  KIRK: Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here. Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan.",MCCOY
"Very good, Spock. We may make a human of you yet. ",KIRK
"Transport room, this is the captain speaking. Are the transporters beaming up yet? ",KIRK
"I can understand her now, without the aid of the universal translator. ",KIRK
Could be coming from beneath the planet's surface. Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity. ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them. ",SPOCK
"Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship. ",SPOCK
The dosage should be doubly lethal. ,KIRK
"Uhura, inform Starbase Twenty Three we have arrived at the gas cloud and are starting to map. ",KIRK
One more step and I'll kill you. ,KIRK
I didn't ask for any.,KIRK
Did he report anything wrong? ,MCCOY
Trouble? ,KIRK
"Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu.",SPOCK
"No one rules the galaxy. Men and machines co-exist, each helping the other. ",KIRK
"Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating.",SPOCK
"It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim jurisdiction. ",SPOCK
Kirk to bridge. ,KIRK
"Eight planets, Captain. That is the number in the Fabrina solar system. ",SPOCK
"Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent. ",KIRK
Spock. (clears throat) Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer? ",SPOCK
"Projection, Captain. Unreal. ",SPOCK
"Fantastic machine, the M-5. No off switch. ",MCCOY
"Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able  MCCOY: No arguments, Spock. Doctor's orders. ",SPOCK
But she was right. Peace was the way. ,KIRK
"Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? ",KIRK
Beam me aboard. ,KIRK
A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel? ,KIRK
Warp drive out. Deflector shields down. Transporter under repair. We are on emergency impulse power. ,SPOCK
What's keeping the processing this time? ,KIRK
"Give us some altitude, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
All engines stop. Hold position here. ,SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation. ",SPOCK
"Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed. ",SPOCK
"There is something else, Captain. I'm getting a reading of some kind of power from that building) ",SPOCK
I don't know. But there is a possibility. ,SPOCK
"An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix. ",SPOCK
"No, Spock. It's illegal, that's what it is. Besides, I must stand trial. I have to find out. ",MCCOY
Spock. Are you all right? ,KIRK
Planet's rotation is carrying primary target beyond arc of phaser lock. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
My wife. Is she all right? ,KIRK
Strongly indicated. ,SPOCK
This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. (it's green) ,KIRK
Get Scott down below. ,KIRK
There's no way to tell from here. The mechanical exploded. We can't reach the roof from the outside. We'll have to try to get to him from the interior. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Science Officer. Come to one eight one mark seven. ",KIRK
Strong enough to eat machinery? ,KIRK
Where is he? ,KIRK
"Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally correlated: He's dying. You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality.",MCCOY
"But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock. ",KIRK
"Position of the intruder, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way.,KIRK
You've seen them. Do they have bodies? ,KIRK
"She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for.",MCCOY
What are you saying? ,KIRK
"Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here. I'd like to see you in it. Why don't you put it on?",MCCOY
Got to break through it somehow. ,MCCOY
"And if we do stop, we'll be drawn into one of the villi and the ship will explode. ",KIRK
Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits. ,KIRK
What happened to the Gorn?,KIRK
"We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen hundred Benecia time. ",SPOCK
They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain. ,SPOCK
"Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take the risk. ",SPOCK
Yes. I am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster of ships ahead of us. ,SPOCK
"So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it? Not on your life. I intend to fight. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"No, thank you. ",MCCOY
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Unidentified. This is not a drill. ,SPOCK
"Patience, Doctor. ",SPOCK
That computer must be programming these replicas. ,KIRK
"We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker. ",SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked. ,KIRK
What happened to them? ,KIRK
"Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting better. ",KIRK
You were injured? ,SPOCK
"The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're growing older by the minute. Much older. My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing. In fact, I don't have a clue. ",MCCOY
"Fascinating. A very high order of workmanship, very ancient, generating great power. ",SPOCK
"Maybe some other time, Lara. We still have our work cut out for us here. ",KIRK
"Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, Doctor? ",SPOCK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
"As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H. ",SPOCK
I'm Captain James Kirk  FLINT: I know who you are. I have monitored your ship since it entered this system. ,KIRK
"Well, confine him.",MCCOY
We can take care of ourselves. ,KIRK
Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the Captain. ,SPOCK
"I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian. ",MCCOY
I'll be right there. ,MCCOY
"There he is. I don't know how he did it, but he got through. Come on, we'll have to go around. That Pandronian's actions just don't make sense. ",KIRK
"This is an odd time to remain adamant. All right, let's go.",KIRK
"Besides, you stiff-necked thistle head, you could have gotten yourself killed. ",KIRK
"Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation. ",KIRK
Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides come down.,SPOCK
"At least I've got my medical kit, for all the good it is. ",MCCOY
"He'll pull through. Jim, what about Spock? If we don't have that drug in twenty hours, he'll die. ",MCCOY
Photon torpedoes. Minimum spread pattern. ,KIRK
We'll hit Tchar. ,KIRK
"Yes, but in this case, with the more people we take down, the greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos. ",KIRK
And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment. ,SPOCK
One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet. ,SPOCK
"Sit down and breathe deeply, please. ",MCCOY
"We need to coordinate this to our own universe. Can we do that, Spock? ",KIRK
"Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture. ",SPOCK
"I'm sorry, Tommy. Marcos Twelve is not within our patrol area.",KIRK
Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut eleven years ago. ,KIRK
The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny. ,KIRK
"And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam the security party down immediately. Kirk out. ",KIRK
Are you aware it can change its molecular structure? ,KIRK
Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. ,KIRK
Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?,MCCOY
Certainly. ,KIRK
"Ready when you are, Captain. ",SPOCK
And you are sure that this is the correct slide? ,SPOCK
"I don't know yet, Jim.",MCCOY
I'd like to talk to you. ,KIRK
No shields? ,KIRK
And how will you pay for your acts of murder? ,KIRK
"I'll want a complete transcript of everything that happens down there, Yeoman. ",KIRK
"Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you. ",KIRK
Not even Sarian brandy? ,KIRK
There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans. ,MCCOY
You're a Metron?,KIRK
A plant? It moves. ,MCCOY
"That was the order, helmsman. ",KIRK
"The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings. ",SPOCK
"Megavoltage. Touch the wrong line, and you're dead.",KIRK
"All right, children, you've had a busy day. I think you could use some rest. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters. ",KIRK
It's still a risk. ,MCCOY
"Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out. ",KIRK
"Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us successfully develop Sherman's Planet. ",SPOCK
Get the transporter room ready. ,KIRK
"Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe that  KOMACK [on monitor]: You will proceed to Altair Six as ordered. You have your orders. Starfleet out. ",KIRK
"Well, if we came upon an alien creature we'd never seen before, the first thing we'd do is to make sure it was free of harmful bacteria. Then we'd see if it was intelligent. ",MCCOY
"There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not the question. If something unusual is going on down there KIRK: An assumption, Doctor.",MCCOY
"An obscure Earth dialect, Mister Spock. Oochy-woochy coochy-coo.",KIRK
No change? ,KIRK
We've seen how the creature destroys. ,KIRK
Am I not now a prisoner of the Kohms as you are? ,KIRK
Yes. What about Alexander? ,KIRK
"I believe that I can. (Kirks stops him as women walks past) The writing is definitely Fabrini, Captain. I recognise it. ",SPOCK
Doctor Korby was never here.,KIRK
I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you understand? ,KIRK
"Physically, there's nothing wrong with you. ",MCCOY
Then you live here alone. ,SPOCK
You'll have to delay. ,SPOCK
"No, of course. That's, that's me. That's me. But what's causing your tricorder to react? ",KIRK
"Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable. ",SPOCK
"Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now. ",KIRK
"Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you? ",KIRK
"The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.",SPOCK
Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You coming with me? ,KIRK
"On you, Lieutenant! Reject him, and we have a chance to save ourselves. Accept him, and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing less than slavery. We might never get help this far out. Or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you. ",KIRK
It is a device with feeding circuits. They lead into the mind of the priestess leader. Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders. ,SPOCK
Commissioner Hedford was dying. ,SPOCK
"Readings, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can.",MCCOY
"(taking Scott's communicator) What is it, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
Prepared? I was not prepared. Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me in any way. ,KIRK
Do we have final clearance from Gideon? ,SPOCK
That's funny. ,KIRK
"Yes, anything! Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey.",KIRK
Where? ,KIRK
This whole thing is a new experience for all of us. ,MCCOY
This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you controlled through this device? ,SPOCK
That thought has occasionally crossed my mind. ,SPOCK
"Hold it! Over there. You, over there. Move, move, move. ",KIRK
"Jim, we've been through it and through it. Radiation, heat  KIRK: But one other thing you haven't mentioned. It's bright. It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough. ",MCCOY
Spock? ,MCCOY
Sonny! ,KIRK
Inside solid rock? ,MCCOY
"It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no protective shields. ",SPOCK
Yes. (Notices the piles of books everywhere) What is all this? ,KIRK
Do they come from the sky? ,KIRK
What's that? ,MCCOY
"Pollux Four. Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere. Sensors indicate no life forms. Approximate age four billion years. Judged no reason for contact. In all respects, quite ordinary, Captain. ",SPOCK
What? ,KIRK
Excellent. What's the emergency? ,KIRK
"If ever there was a time to get out of here, it is now. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, come in. ",KIRK
She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations!,KIRK
"Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it, but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command. Am I right? ",MCCOY
Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it. ,KIRK
A what? ,KIRK
"Standing by, Number One.",SPOCK
I'll try and avoid it. ,KIRK
You were alive then? ,KIRK
"Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk by, please. (scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do that. ",MCCOY
Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment. ,SPOCK
"Get back to Engineering. Try to re-establish engine control, and talk to ordnance about manufacturing phaser replacements. ",KIRK
It killed four crewmen. Now Crater.,KIRK
"Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room  STONE: Mister Spock, the court has not yet reached a verdict. We will hear this witness out. ",SPOCK
"I accept the responsibility, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too.,MCCOY
"No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else!",KIRK
"Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions. You now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task. ",SPOCK
"We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu.",KIRK
Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their thoughts are becoming hers. ",SPOCK
"In every revolution, there's one man with a vision. ",KIRK
"Well, we're doing everything that's possible.",MCCOY
"Bele, you keep this up, and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner. The rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged. This will be your final battlefield. Your fifty thousand years of pursuit will have been wasted. ",KIRK
"Which one are you now, the replica or the real one? ",KIRK
"More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately 1960. ",SPOCK
We were? What could she learn from us? ,KIRK
Why did you do it? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, I have to hand it to you. This is just what the doctor would have ordered. ",MCCOY
"It might, to some. ",SPOCK
That's what matters. ,KIRK
"All right, Scotty. I'll handle it down here.",KIRK
That is your father's wish? ,SPOCK
"Now, wait a minute, Commissioner,  BELE: Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such. Yes, he will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process put thousands of innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his loathsome accusations and his foul threats. ",KIRK
So far that's not much help. ,KIRK
I'm not sure. ,KIRK
"Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining. ",MCCOY
You may be premature. There are many possibilities. ,SPOCK
So it would seem. Captain. ,SPOCK
Captain. ,SPOCK
I have no intention of striking you dead. ,KIRK
In what way? ,SPOCK
Put me on ship-wide intercom. ,KIRK
Check the circuit. ,SPOCK
"Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll talk! Guard! Guard, I'll talk! ",KIRK
"Scotty, inform Starfleet Command. Disengage nacelles, Jettison if possible. Mister Spock, assist them. Advise and analyse. Scotty? Scotty? ",KIRK
"Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five. ",KIRK
You're returning with us? ,KIRK
It must have been tied in to the tape viewer somehow. ,KIRK
"Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you picking up? ",KIRK
"Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler. ",KIRK
"The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it. ",SPOCK
"To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain the importance of going to Talos Four.",SPOCK
"Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to you, and to your dressmaker. ",SPOCK
"The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them. If and when it becomes necessary. ",KIRK
Sickbay. ,KIRK
Let's get him to Sickbay. Every one back to stations. ,KIRK
"Mister Scott, it worked. Great. (sees that maw turning towards them) I think it's great. Scotty, get us out of here. ",KIRK
"I don't know. I'm not familiar with that quadrant. Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident. Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose. ",KIRK
Perhaps the transporter is the key. ,SPOCK
Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady. ,KIRK
"Get to your post. Run today's communication from Starfleet Command. I want to know my exact orders and options, if any. ",KIRK
"When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him. His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines. He could talk only to the ship. Now he can see nothing but the woman.",KIRK
How do you do? ,KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"Aye, sir. ",SPOCK
"Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners. ",KIRK
"And he thinks he's the right man for her, but I'm not sure she thinks he's the right man. On the other hand, she's a woman. All woman.",MCCOY
I thought you might like to know that Lieutenant Uhura is back to college level. She'll be back on the job within a week. ,MCCOY
"Stay with him, helm. ",KIRK
I see you didn't waste time taking your shore leave. ,KIRK
In your own private paradise. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock received a starbase transmission, a message from the former commander of the Enterprise, Fleet Captain Pike, urgently requesting that we divert here.",KIRK
"That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster! ",KIRK
"Scotty, help.",KIRK
I don't know. (collapses),KIRK
How? ,KIRK
"He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all. ",SPOCK
"Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago? (flash) Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control.",SPOCK
Mister Scott is still with us. ,SPOCK
I had to confine my orderly to sickbay.,MCCOY
"That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me, because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now you're just going to take over. ",KIRK
But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet. ,KIRK
Cry? ,SPOCK
It's necessary. ,KIRK
"Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous. ",SPOCK
"Cancel Red Alert, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"You mentioned dikironium, Captain. ",SPOCK
You must save the life of our friend. ,KIRK
How can he die? Can I survive without him? ,KIRK
I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. ,SPOCK
"We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Notify Starbase Four that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and it will be returned along with its user as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus. ",KIRK
All right. Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard. ,KIRK
"Speed, Scotty? ",KIRK
Against what? There's no life on this planet. ,KIRK
Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them. ,KIRK
"Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary. But  KIRK: But these people shouldn't be alive. ",SPOCK
"This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of course.",SPOCK
"Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up.",MCCOY
Mister Scott. Mister Scott? ,KIRK
"Well, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Helm, give us warp speed.",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"In that case, Captain, I would suggest we apply forward thrust. ",SPOCK
About one hundred yards in that direction. But after an attack as thorough as this one KIRK: I'll risk it.,SPOCK
"Look! Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives. A thousand lifetimes. Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us. ",KIRK
"We need our communicators, those devices on our belts. If there's a Klingon ship somewhere  AKAAR: The sky does not interest me. I must consider the words I have heard. ",KIRK
"Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply.",MCCOY
Two thirds of the personnel are affected. ,MCCOY
Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life. ,SPOCK
"Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies. You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise. ",KIRK
"Are you all right, Captain? ",SPOCK
Were you able to make sense our of the symbols? ,MCCOY
"Deflectors, full intensity.",SPOCK
They registered as human. ,MCCOY
Which one of you is Tongo Rad? ,KIRK
English. ,KIRK
I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy? ,SPOCK
"In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power. ",KIRK
"To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack. ",SPOCK
"Don't misunderstand my next question. Mister Spock, why aren't you dead? ",KIRK
Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.,SPOCK
"One of the many stories I've heard about you, Mister Winston.",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
On humans. ,SPOCK
"No, this is not off the record. ",KIRK
Who are you? ,MCCOY
"Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand? ",KIRK
Bones. ,KIRK
Are you forgetting Kzinti females are dumb animals? In an emergency the Kzinti may forget a human female is an intelligent creature. ,SPOCK
"Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before. ",SPOCK
That was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when I was attacked by a wild animal. ,SPOCK
Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also trained to be a diplomat. Why not try a carrot instead of a stick? ,MCCOY
"Captain, on the viewscreen. ",SPOCK
"However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but definitely registering. ",SPOCK
So you can attack me again? That would be foolish. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons? ",KIRK
"Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an investigation of this so that a proper report ADAMS [OC]: No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er, Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible.",KIRK
"Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles! ",KIRK
The female of your kind. ,KIRK
"It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs  KORBY: Captain, I'd much prefer  KIRK: Rayburn, are you receiving? ",KIRK
The Klingon? ,SPOCK
"He did say his planet was hidden, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, however we view him, Captain, he's certainly no ordinary specimen. Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I had your readings, I'd be the most incredible physical specimen of all time. ",MCCOY
Those are conditions most people would envy. ,KIRK
"I have a theory, Captain. ",SPOCK
Just one. ,MCCOY
"It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel. ",MCCOY
Freefall! ,SPOCK
Open it. ,KIRK
"A capability, I'm afraid, out of the reach of most humans. ",SPOCK
"They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be more a sensation of feeling it. ",SPOCK
"My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And now I'll go to my quarters. ",SPOCK
Sulu! ,KIRK
"We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles. ",SPOCK
Neither do the pods. Communications are dead. Building overload.,KIRK
"Relax, Captain, you're among friends. I'm Captain James T. Kirk. ",KIRK

Final sensor readings? ,KIRK
"Mister Arex, take over for him. Lieutenant Uhura, report to navigation console. ",KIRK
One is the beginning. ,SPOCK
What kind of jewels are in this? ,KIRK
"Fate, Captain. Fate. ",SPOCK
"Helmsman, emergency battery power. ",KIRK
"I understand. (Spock puts his hands on Gelder's face) Good, the reading's levelling.",MCCOY
"We're here, Bones. And the theories about this place seem to be right. ",KIRK
No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. ,KIRK
It never makes any sense. We both have to know that there was a reason. ,KIRK
The word was smog. ,MCCOY
"Scotty, I'll find out. ",KIRK
"If my guess is correct, they won't have to.",KIRK
And very brief. ,KIRK
"Still approaching, Captain. Going sublight. It continues to probe us. Its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting. ",SPOCK
I understand. May I show you to your quarters? ,SPOCK
"Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. ",SPOCK
Thanks. The air was running out under there. ,MCCOY
Maintain. (he answers the intercom) Bridge. ,KIRK
"Not now, Jim. ",MCCOY
Go to sensor probes. ,KIRK
Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it. ,KIRK
"Yes, sir. ",MCCOY
"Bridge to Engineering. Mister Scott, why are we losing speed? ",KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area. ",SPOCK
"Analysis. Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo? ",KIRK
You need my approval? ,KIRK
"History files. Subject, former Governor Kodos of Tarsus Four, also known as Kodos the Executioner. After that, background on actor Anton Karidian. ",KIRK
I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here. ,MCCOY
"Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our co-ordinates. ",KIRK
"Apollo's no god. But he could have been taken for one, though, once. Say five thousand years ago, a highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you give me warp eight? ",SPOCK
"Captain's log, Star date 1313.8. Add to official losses, Doctor Elizabeth Dehner. Be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask for what happened to him. ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation. ",KIRK
"No. Mister Sulu, resume course for Troyius. ",KIRK

I like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining  SCOTT: Come along. ,KIRK
Not directly. ,SPOCK
"You received my signal, Mister Scott.",SPOCK
Probably? ,KIRK
Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.,SPOCK
"Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so. ",SPOCK
"Lazarus, you're hurt. I know. I sympathise, but I've got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about. Now where are those crystals? ",KIRK
"Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism. ",SPOCK
There are no administrative duties required here. ,KIRK
All right. You're working for me. ,KIRK
How could that be? Unless it's powered. A spaceship? ,KIRK
Starfleet. ,KIRK
"Chekov, mortar and pestle. ",KIRK
"Yes, you presume correctly. ",KIRK
All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command. No one claims anyone without due process. ,KIRK
"Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase. ",SPOCK
Lieutenant Uhura? ,KIRK
Readings? ,KIRK
But how? ,KIRK
"Here, let me help you, Sergeant. It's operated with this dial here. ",SPOCK
"Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it. ",KIRK
"Extend your arm, Mister Jaris. ",KIRK
"Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative? ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to. ",SPOCK
May I ask what crime you committed?,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, let's get out of here, through that grid. ",KIRK
"(looking about the same as usual) Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time. ",SPOCK
She's dead. ,MCCOY
"I'm sorry, Mister Atoz. Mister Atoz! ",KIRK
And the punishment is death? ,MCCOY
He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know. ,KIRK
"Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it  KIRK: We'll have to kill them. ",SPOCK
(holding up a hypo) I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this. At least it'll give Kirk a fighting chance. ,MCCOY
We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in forty eight hours. ,KIRK
"Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, the intruder is in your area. ",KIRK

"I am alone on the Enterprise. I have searched every area of the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew, or an indication of how its disappearance was managed.

Not when I came in. ,KIRK
You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it. ,KIRK
Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan? ,KIRK
I'll activate the force field myself. You can return to your section. ,SPOCK
The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I can understand. ,SPOCK

There may be dangers within. ,SPOCK
So is he. ,KIRK
"I have the distinct feeling this planet's playing cat and mouse with us, but for what reason? ",KIRK
"We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. ",SPOCK
"Bright as a blade. Come with me, both of you. ",KIRK
"Yes, of course. The entire landing party.",SPOCK
Good. Keep monitoring. How are you coming along with the circuit switchover? ,KIRK
"Yes, that's correct. ",MCCOY
"In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you?",KIRK
Anything on your scanners? ,KIRK
"The last piece of sabotage. I know who you are. A thousand feet up, no method of reaching the Soul, except by air, by flight. Tchar. ",KIRK
Agreed. ,SPOCK
"Good. Now, Mister Spock  SPOCK: One moment, sir. Commodore. I believe you are scheduled for medical examination. Mister Montgomery. ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you? ",SPOCK
"(referring to viewscreen) If you believe that, we have. ",KIRK
"We have a medical problem. Your ex-Lord, Harry Mudd. ",KIRK
I haven't decided. ,KIRK
Then it is not a zookeeper. ,SPOCK
"No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir.",SPOCK
"Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the planet, on the lower hemisphere. Humanoid readings. ",SPOCK
"Sargon here, McCoy. I'm in your deck six briefing room. ",KIRK
How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us? ,KIRK
"Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked up. ",SPOCK
"Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence. ",KIRK
You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here. ,SPOCK
What are you doing here? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Yeoman. Bring it to the Bridge. I'll be there in a moment. ",KIRK
We've got serious trouble with the main computer. We have reason to believe it's kidnapped three of our crew. ,KIRK

Take it easy. ,MCCOY

Contact medical stores. I want as much haemoplasm as they can spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes. ,KIRK

"It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation techniques. ",SPOCK

"Well, as you know, we both brought Lazarus in here and I treated a deep abrasion on his forehead, right? ",MCCOY
"I think not, Harry. ",KIRK
Who's in charge? I wish to speak to him. ,KIRK
"No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a first-class example to the androids of a human failure. They'll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future. ",KIRK
"A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser. I have found villagers who will corroborate it. ",SPOCK
Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price. ,KIRK
She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the Fuhrer. ,KIRK

What's the law in these cases? ,KIRK
I'm beginning to get the idea. ,KIRK
"Right away, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below. ",SPOCK
"If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott. ",KIRK

"Yes, Spock. ",KIRK
"Beam us up, quickly. ",KIRK
Who is it? Can you tell? ,KIRK
"Swensen, Bardoli come with me. ",KIRK
"Let me go alone, Captain. ",SPOCK
Through the use of a spy using the human form of Carter Winston. ,KIRK
"Good. Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert. ",KIRK
Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there. ,SPOCK
What the devil is going on? ,MCCOY
Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier. ,KIRK
"By the way, Mister Sulu, any chance of teaching me that body throw? Could come in handy sometime. ",KIRK
Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled. ,SPOCK
"The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions. ",SPOCK
I wouldn't believe the human organism could take such pain. ,MCCOY

"Captain, why should I aim at such a structure? ",SPOCK
Or the purpose of the attack was something else. ,SPOCK
"Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Ahead warp factor one. ",KIRK
They'll be along. You rushed us down ten minutes early. (enter building),KIRK

"Bring some for the doctor, too.",KIRK
I believe you will find ten cc's adequate. ,SPOCK

"Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial.",KIRK

"If we beam down, can you compare our position with his control setting? ",KIRK
"Mister Walking Bear, do the legends say what happened to Kukulkan? ",KIRK
But where? To what purpose? The number of ships indicates a mass migration. Or invasion. ,KIRK
No. There's no mention of it. ,MCCOY
"I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those symbols are the key. ",SPOCK
A what? ,MCCOY

"What about the Captain? We can't leave  DECKER: Doctor, you may leave the Bridge. ",MCCOY
"There is no sure way to guard our thoughts from him. Mister Sulu, he is not likely to deal with me or Lieutenant Uhura. She and I are inferior beings to them. But the Kzinti are meat eaters. If you sense him reading your mind, think of eating a raw vegetable. ",SPOCK
"Force field, Captain. ",SPOCK
"In the meantime, what about Jim? ",MCCOY
This is General Trelane. ,KIRK
"This is the thing we come from. Lieutenant, this is what I want. ",KIRK
Were they like this when you first came? ,KIRK
Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected? ,KIRK
"Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately 7,824.7 to 1. ",SPOCK
"None whatsoever. Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity.",KIRK

Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer? ,SPOCK
"Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft. Perhaps with a protective shield  KIRK: I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed. ",MCCOY

"True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure. ",SPOCK
"All right, what happened? ",KIRK
Stand by tractor beams. ,KIRK
Astonishment. ,SPOCK
Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself. ,SPOCK
Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time? ,MCCOY
That's exactly what I mean. ,KIRK
How do you mean? ,KIRK
That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun. Why? ,KIRK
"I must say, I like the styling. ",KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
May we see you a moment? ,SPOCK
I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks. ,MCCOY

"She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power. Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel. It is, therefore, self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on. ",SPOCK
Will he make it? ,KIRK
"Good night, Scotty. You dressed up for the occasion, Spock. Very impressive. ",KIRK
Yes. Your attention. ,KIRK
"There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to work? ",KIRK
"Yes, I mentioned that. ",MCCOY
"They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant.",SPOCK
"No, I don't see that at all. ",KIRK
"Better do what they want for now, anyway. They activated another force field. ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
I must say that's a gracious invitation. ,KIRK
"It's too risky, Jim. Argo's almost totally unexplored. You'd be out of contact range, unarmed. ",MCCOY
Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of. ,MCCOY
(laughs) Is there anything else? ,KIRK
Spock. How long? ,KIRK
"Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all. ",MCCOY
"All right. The temple is his power source. Let's bring him back to it. Get to cover. Mister Spock, fire those phasers. ",KIRK
You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet. Fifty eight days. ,MCCOY
So am I. ,KIRK
"No, everything is in order, Lieutenant. Stand by.",KIRK
You're talking nonsense. ,KIRK
Can you explain what happened? ,KIRK
"Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere. ",MCCOY
"I saw that, but I don't believe it. ",MCCOY
"How are the repairs progressing, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired. ",KIRK
"Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you would be more precise. ",SPOCK
"But at a dangerously low level. Well, we're still alive. I suppose that's something. ",MCCOY
Stay where you are. ,KIRK
"No, just a little shaken up. ",KIRK

The President and Edith Keeler. ,KIRK
His father helped me get into the Academy. ,KIRK

You say that we forgot you. How can you expect us to regard you as a deity if we don't remember you? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message. ",KIRK
"Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less than one hundred metres away. ",SPOCK
I must see the captain. ,SPOCK
Then that space probe that approached Earth must have been his.,KIRK
A fraud. But sold for enough credits to get to Sirius Nine. ,SPOCK
The error was corrected. ,KIRK
I'm making a suggestion. ,SPOCK
Don't they ever rest? ,KIRK
"Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship. ",KIRK
"I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much.",MCCOY
But he didn't. And history has made its judgment. ,KIRK
Take Sulu. Find McCoy's body. This man is my problem.,KIRK
"Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest? ",SPOCK
And as little freedom. ,SPOCK
"This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history. ",SPOCK
Lieutenant Galway. ,MCCOY
Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship? ,KIRK
"Bring it aboard? If the antimatter touches the inside of the ship or any of us, we'll be blown to bits. ",KIRK
"Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly. ",SPOCK
How about weight? ,SPOCK
"Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and  FLINT: And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected. ",MCCOY
"The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger  KIRK: Spock. ",SPOCK
"I don't know, Jim. This is a big ship. I'm just a country doctor. ",MCCOY
"Spock, the computer! Destroy it! ",KIRK
"I'm all right. Are you all right, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
Strange you didn't get a voice reply. ,MCCOY
Very well. ,KIRK
There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down. ,KIRK
Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean so little to you? ,KIRK
Status report. ,KIRK
"That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador.",MCCOY
"Why? What is it, Jim? ",MCCOY
You know of Earth? You've been there? ,KIRK
Lieutenant McGivers. ,SPOCK
Spock? ,KIRK
Find the man at the other end of the phone  [Transporter room],KIRK
Unbelievable. Do you recognise those uniforms? ,KIRK
Reduce speed to sub warp cruise. We'll lay by here for repairs. ,KIRK
What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back. ,MCCOY
"I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx.",SPOCK
"I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation considerably. ",SPOCK
"Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for dikironium in the atmosphere. Set your phasers on disrupter-B. If you see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately. You're on Red Alert. Make a sweep. ",KIRK
"No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four. Try. ",KIRK
And a half. ,KIRK
"Jim, there's something about these tribbles. ",MCCOY
Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative. ,SPOCK
"A more useful comment, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Is he dead, Captain? ",SPOCK
It would appear that the entity wants us alive. ,SPOCK
We can't do that. Perhaps you know his name. Merik. Captain Merik. ,KIRK
"Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off? ",KIRK
"Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim. ",MCCOY
I'm afraid so.,KIRK
"I'm sorry, Captain. ",SPOCK
Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out.,KIRK
Give me back my ship. Your secret is safe with us. ,KIRK
"Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space. ",KIRK
"You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan.",SPOCK
"No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy. That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy. ",SPOCK
"I wasn't sure before, but I am now. This is the source of your power, isn't it. The transmuter. ",KIRK
Be careful. ,MCCOY
"Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column. ",SPOCK
"Look, Let's not talk shop. ",KIRK
"Computer, identify verification. ",KIRK
"She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead, Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill! ",MCCOY
"Why, because you're well again? ",KIRK
That girl. ,KIRK
What about the armoury? ,KIRK
Did these ladies come voluntarily? ,KIRK
And what am I supposed to do? ,KIRK
"Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment. ",KIRK
Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin. ,SPOCK
"William Claiborne, that's right. ",KIRK
This is Kirk.,KIRK
I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach. ,SPOCK
That ought to do it. ,KIRK
"Scotty, Bones. (and it's all the way around.) We're trapped. They got their way. We've got to stand and fight. ",KIRK
"Apollo, we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks. ",KIRK
"Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. Let's get at it. ",KIRK
Where are you? ,KIRK
"All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level. ",SPOCK

I don't see anything. I can't understand it. ,KIRK
"Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this. ",MCCOY
"When I find the headquarters genius that assigned me a female yeoman MCCOY: What's the matter, Jim. Don't you trust yourself?",KIRK
"They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir.",SPOCK
No. (looking at his shaking hand) We're not.,SPOCK
Why are you endangering your lives by coming here? ,SPOCK
"Yes Captain, but you may find it difficult to believe. The vessel is registered to Carter Winston. ",SPOCK
"While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians return, I shall go with them. ",SPOCK

"McCoy here, Jim. ",MCCOY
Put it on screen. ,KIRK
"I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you  KIRK: Go ahead. ",MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is. I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out. ",KIRK
This thing has a negative energy charge. Everything seems to work in reverse. We'll use anti-matter. ,KIRK
I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best. ,KIRK
"Jim, I don't understand. ",SPOCK
Tell me. The ship's supply of food concentrates couldn't have lasted fourteen years. ,MCCOY
Your surprise package is an Air Police sergeant from the base. ,KIRK
"I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant. ",SPOCK
"Full power, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"No, sir. ",SPOCK
"In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Do you have any further information? ,KIRK
"Not that I have observed, Captain. Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied. ",SPOCK
We must go. ,KIRK
Fire only on my signal. Flank out. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector Nine. Pipe it down to McCoy's office. ",KIRK
"Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant.",KIRK
"Oh, I thought sure you'd know Thelin by now, Jim. He's been your first officer for five years. ",MCCOY
To beam down to your council chamber. ,SPOCK
This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel. Clearance plans now in effect. ,KIRK
"Very well, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most. ",MCCOY
"Very well, Mister Arex. Spock, let's see how close your percentage is. ",KIRK
"Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood  SPOCK: My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is.",MCCOY
You're killing me. You're killing me.,KIRK
"Don't you find that painful, Captain? ",SPOCK
You received a distress call? We received a distress call. ,KIRK
Hydrogen cloud reflection? ,KIRK
"Mister Chekov is involved, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Our communicators, weapons. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, you seem to understand these people. You will deal with them. ",KIRK
Then why do it if you don't want to? ,KIRK
Truth. You do not desire to consume other beings. It would be best if you return to your origin. The way you came. Will you do this? ,SPOCK
We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off.,KIRK
"Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor. You mean to tell me that that thing is a giant single-celled animal? ",KIRK
You're four-oh. ,MCCOY
Maximum security. Is he so afraid? ,KIRK
"Fascinating. But we're not here on a pleasure trip, Lara. ",KIRK
It was that bad? ,KIRK
Chekov. ,KIRK
"Name, Khan, as we know him today. (Spock changes the picture)",KIRK
It was from Van Gelder. He thought you'd like to know the treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed.,SPOCK
That's not Mira talking. ,KIRK
Not in free fall. ,KIRK
"Reading goes off my scale, Captain. Must be a mile in diameter.",SPOCK
I see. ,KIRK
"Screen on, Captain. ",SPOCK
Blast you any way. You had no right to come along.,KIRK
"No, I'm not. Now listen to me! Hear me out. When your ancestors discovered that their world was dying they built a great ship and chose their best people. They wished for their race to survive. They sent the ship out into space. ",KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is Daystrom? ,MCCOY
How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow you apart. ,MCCOY
Isn't there any way we can help them? ,KIRK
"Get us off, Scott! ",SPOCK
Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience. How did you know? ,SPOCK
Spock. ,KIRK
"That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an uncharted quarter. What are you doing so far from home? (no answer) You understand that when we complete our mission, we'll take you to Starbase where you'll face a very serious charge. ",KIRK
(scanning him) Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is.,MCCOY
Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. ,SPOCK
Increase deflector shields to maximum. ,KIRK
Some heart flutter. Better risk a few drops of cordrazine. ,MCCOY
"Who knows? It might eventually cure the common cold, but lengthen lives? Poppycock. I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly. ",MCCOY
What did you have in mind? ,KIRK
"That unit, Scotty, status report. ",KIRK
The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years.,MCCOY
Could more Klingons have beamed aboard? ,KIRK
"What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I thought I had until dawn. ",KIRK
Did you say they were safe? ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"And very evasive. Or at least not fully responsive. Now, then,  LOKAI: I insist, I'm extremely tired. Made so by your vindictive cross-examinations. I will answer no more questions. ",KIRK
Attacking vessels are moving off. ,SPOCK
Mister Spock. Spock. ,KIRK
We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us? ,KIRK
That would explain why there are no adults. ,KIRK
"I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed. ",SPOCK
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container. ,KIRK
Khan. Nothing else? ,KIRK
"Preliminary reports, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Landru is dead. You are a machine. A question has been put to you. Answer it. ,KIRK
"Sensors indicate the epicentre of the quake was in the north polar seas, Captain, a totally uninhabited area. ",SPOCK
"Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago. ",SPOCK
Captain. I would recommend a discreet distance. ,SPOCK
What did you learn? ,KIRK
Tests? ,MCCOY
You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command. That's where you'll be facing your charges. ,KIRK
Plans to McKinley Rocket Base.,KIRK
Go. ,KIRK
I need communications. ,KIRK
Not without you. ,KIRK
Then we'll take him with us. ,KIRK
"Yes, sir.",SPOCK
"We'll fight if we have to. Sulu, are we headed for the exact co-ordinates where the Klothos disappeared? ",KIRK
"Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said  KALO: I know what he said, bud. He said some of the boys would meet you. Okay, we're meeting you. ",KIRK
We are very interested in your world. ,SPOCK
Enterprise. Spock here.,SPOCK
"Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless, anticipating that she would deny you admittance. However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me. ",SPOCK
"Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything. ",KIRK
"Nomad, come here.",KIRK
"Forty, thirty. ",SPOCK
"First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain. ",SPOCK
Exactly. ,KIRK
"I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be little choice. ",SPOCK
Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What?,KIRK
That seems logical. ,KIRK
"In fact, I do. But only to a certain point. ",SPOCK
Bones? ,KIRK
"Personal log, Commander Spock, USS Enterprise. I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it.",SPOCK
"We're being observed, watched. ",MCCOY
When is that interphase going to happen? ,MCCOY
"Thanks, Scotty. Spread out. Find Commander Bem. He's split into three individual parts. ",KIRK
Standby to activate warp drive unit. ,KIRK
I'll try. ,KIRK
I know the Captain. He is in  SHAW: Please instruct the witness not to speculate. ,SPOCK
"Quite right, Spock. And that responsibility includes not losing the best science officer in Starfleet. ",KIRK
You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter? ,KIRK
Are you aware that Harry Mudd is tricking you via an illusion? ,SPOCK
"The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't. ",MCCOY
"The Klingons are free. They're armed as we are. They'll try to take the ship. Scotty, how many men do we have? ",KIRK
"Mister Lurry, you issued a Priority One distress call. State the nature of your emergency. ",KIRK
Doctor McCoy will show you. ,KIRK
"Barrows, give me a report.",KIRK
"I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar. ",SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
And communications and fire control. ,MCCOY
"Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here. ",SPOCK
"To a degree, with our own species and with some others, but the Lactran intelligence is eons beyond mine. ",SPOCK
I also picked up indications of large cities. ,SPOCK
The probability of his presence on Motherlode is eight one percent plus or minus point five three. ,SPOCK
What was said and what happened between us was for us alone. ,KIRK
Come in. ,SPOCK
"That's right. These immunising agents take time, and that's the real tragedy. Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died. ",MCCOY
"Yes, I see. Scout up the trail that way. See what we have in the way of an exit. I'll take a look around. ",KIRK
"We're on a thousand planets and spreading out. We cross fantastic distances and everything's alive, Cochrane. Life everywhere. We estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life. We haven't begun to map them. Interesting? ",KIRK
"I didn't do it! Spock, the disease, what is it? What's the antidote? ",MCCOY
"Mister Scott, the storm has caused some minor damage in your section. There are also injuries requiring your attention, Doctor. Well, gentlemen? ",SPOCK
"Yes, Scotty. ",KIRK
It's entirely up to you. ,KIRK
Can you calculate the geographic centre of the wave emissions from the planet's surface? ,KIRK
Because he was drawing a weapon on another of their guests. ,MCCOY
"But I can, Professor. ",KIRK
"Negative. Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens. ",SPOCK
Bones. ,KIRK
Let's go. ,KIRK
What purpose? ,SPOCK
"Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. ",KIRK
"In the next room, there are other receptacles. The other two of us that survived. You, Doctor Ann Mulhall, and you, Mister Spock, we require your bodies also. We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again. ",KIRK
Beautiful specimen. ,KIRK
"Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four. ",KIRK
And at this distance? ,KIRK
"No. No, it might require amassed phasers. ",KIRK
"Gothos again, Captain. ",SPOCK
Energise. ,SPOCK
"It is a force globe, but one that is flexible enough to absorb any force. I cannot explain it. Clearly we cannot escape by simply fleeing. Sensors indicate we at now being probed. ",SPOCK
"Unknown at present, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic. ",MCCOY
"I'd like those answers now. First, the purpose of your star flight. ",KIRK
Scotty? ,KIRK
"Rayna, come with me. ",KIRK
"The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it? ",MCCOY
Keep trying. We've got a diplomatic tiger by the tail. ,KIRK
Doctor? ,SPOCK
"Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer. ",KIRK
"Evasive action will not be effective, Captain. The force globe limits our manoeuvreing. ",SPOCK
"It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, any indication of that ship's power source? ",KIRK
Where's Kirk? ,MCCOY
"Speed, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing. ",KIRK
Yes.,SPOCK
"My pleasure, Captain. ",SPOCK
But they're still out there. ,KIRK
Report. ,KIRK
Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately. ,KIRK
"You wished to see me, sir? ",SPOCK
"Sunlight, palm trees. We're nine hundred light years from that kind of desert, Bones. ",KIRK
"A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist. ",MCCOY
Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?,SPOCK
"Arthur, the transference is weakening. ",KIRK
I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas.,KIRK
We've out grown you. You asked for something we could no longer give. ,KIRK
Correct. ,SPOCK
And your reflexes. We're going to need fast reflexes from now on.,KIRK
"Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain. ",SPOCK
That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.,SPOCK
"I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do.",SPOCK
Specify. ,KIRK
"No, he's in Sickbay. Doctor McCoy is running a check on the landing party. What is it, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
We're not hungry. ,MCCOY
"The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Is it, Mister Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay, and I'm staying. ",MCCOY
We haven't enough phasers for you. ,KIRK
I didn't.,KIRK
"It is lovely, but I'm more in the mood for a nice quiet walk in the woods. ",MCCOY
Deck twelve. ,SPOCK
"An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill. ",KIRK
I don't believe it. ,KIRK
That is a very good question. ,SPOCK
Prepare to transport on the Captain's co-ordinates on my order. ,SPOCK
"Scotty, how you doing? ",KIRK
And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise. ,SPOCK
"I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge.",SPOCK
"We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner. ",KIRK
You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off.,KIRK
"You speak very strangely, friend. Are you from away? ",MCCOY
"You in a hurry, Mister Scott? ",KIRK
"And it was almost covered with us. I don't know what's going on here, but it's going to stop before someone's hurt. ",KIRK
"Negative, Captain. ",SPOCK
Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer? ,KIRK
Go ahead. ,KIRK
"The pain is gone. She touched my head, and the pain is gone. ",KIRK
"A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them out there, wherever they are. ",MCCOY
Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence. ,SPOCK
"How long will he be asleep, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"And now to the business at hand. With your permission, Captain. ",SPOCK
(to nurse) That'll be all. (she leaves) ,MCCOY
"Daystrom, release that computer control! ",KIRK
"Agreed. Judging from the disappearance of Alondra, the cloud lives on the energy it converts from the planets it consumes. ",KIRK
"I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes? ",KIRK
"Telepathy, Captain. ",SPOCK
Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder? ,KIRK
I remember. Let's forget it. We have a lot of lost time to make up for. ,KIRK
Did I hear that right? ,KIRK
Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.,SPOCK
"Well, that's not too bad. Back to work, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"This expedition should be a geologist's dream, Mister D'Amato. ",KIRK
"The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic interference, no breakdown in your equipment. ",SPOCK
"All right, Spock, let's have it. ",KIRK
"Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign. ",SPOCK
You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman.,KIRK
You have a knack for giving me difficult choices. (kisses her again) You have nothing like that where you come from? ,KIRK
I want you to keep him in the transporter room. No sense in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary. ,KIRK
Jim.,SPOCK
Life sciences.,KIRK
"No, it appears to be conversing with them. A reasoning computer that small? ",SPOCK
Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses. ,KIRK
Where? ,KIRK
Ship damage? ,KIRK
"You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're dangerous. (makes a run for it but Ruk grabs him and throws him around)",KIRK
Acknowledged. ,KIRK
Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants? ,MCCOY
We must return to our duties aboard ship. ,SPOCK
"Time factor, Bones? Epidemic? ",KIRK
"You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. Listen to me. ",SPOCK
What brings you here? ,SPOCK
"I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed.",SPOCK
Yeah. Hot as Vulcan. Now I understand what that phrase means. ,MCCOY
A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate? ,SPOCK
"Normal orbit approach procedures, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
The man making it is Doctor Roger Korby. ,KIRK
"Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived. ",SPOCK
What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed. ,MCCOY
"He will not stay. (He makes Spock release her, and grabs her himself, taking off her bracelet.) Now, you took his brain. You will put it back. How did you do it? ",KIRK
Just because the Vulcans failed  SPOCK: I am more capable. ,MCCOY
"Scotty, if you have a fix. (guns are pointed at his head) Stand by, Scotty. ",KIRK
Scotty. (Scott presses the intercom button) Kirk here. What is it? ,KIRK
"Jim, give him a minute. He's in a state of shock. ",MCCOY
The ship is yours. Take care of her until I come back. ,KIRK
Can you tap into it? ,KIRK
"They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream. A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers. ",KIRK
Hold present course. Slow to warp one. ,KIRK
"Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary. Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at me. Look at me. Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally armed. Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating? Even, Spock, even race hatred? ",KIRK
Minor? Our science doesn't have anything that works that fast.,MCCOY
"Scotty, have you got that pilot yet? ",KIRK
"Then, Mister Spock, comply. ",KIRK
"More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt, pitted. ",SPOCK
We've got it. ,KIRK
One of the missing scientists? ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard. ",KIRK
"Her death is unnecessary. Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would. ",KIRK
I beg your pardon? ,SPOCK
"What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister Spock?",KIRK
"And like us, it's an intelligent animal. There's no need to hunt it down. ",MCCOY
We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present course. ",KIRK
"So, they've broken the treaty. ",KIRK
"More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign. ",MCCOY
It's a starship like nothing I've ever seen. The size of it. ,MCCOY
Seems logical to me. ,MCCOY
And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest?,KIRK
"Hold your fire, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
Well? ,KIRK
"What is it, Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
"Not when you've sat in that room. Take us out of orbit, Mister Spock. Ahead warp factor one.",KIRK
Time factor. ,KIRK
The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise. ,MCCOY
"Sir, does everyone here carry firearms? ",SPOCK
I'll have the truth now. ,KIRK
"This device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze. The unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative. ",KIRK
"No, I think Colonel Green is right. That rock-like thing is our enemy, not those illusions. ",KIRK
"Why were the Klingons chasing you, Jones? ",KIRK
"Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer. Now it's wounded, probably in pain somewhere back there.",KIRK
"Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite impossible. ",SPOCK
"Maybe you can. Tell me the rest. You were fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out of there. ",KIRK
"And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve. ",KIRK
Good. Landing party will pick up phaser number one's from the arsenal. Keep them inconspicuous. Mister Scott. ,KIRK
Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out the lower levels. There seems to be no one aboard. Only uniforms. ,SPOCK
"Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he was in trouble. ",MCCOY
"What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it? ",MCCOY
Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that. ,SPOCK
Pleasure. ,MCCOY
Three minutes forty two point seven seconds. ,SPOCK
"I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be registered on sensors. ",SPOCK
"Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.",SPOCK
Sabotage. ,SPOCK
"The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now. Aim for the lab. ",KIRK
Negative. ,KIRK
"Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion. And according to him, it doesn't wear off. ",MCCOY
I heard you. ,KIRK
Our only chance is the intruder control circuit. Although he's cut it off at the Bridge. ,KIRK
"I see. Mister Spock. Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved. Mister Scott, ready to beam up. ",KIRK
"Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts. If you need assistance, I  GAETANO: We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you? ",SPOCK
The time warp. What did it do to us?,KIRK
"How long have you had that thing, Lieutenant? ",MCCOY
Yes. Very. ,SPOCK
"The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle. ",SPOCK
Captain.,SPOCK
And this is my first officer Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too. ",MCCOY
Thank you. Thank you very much. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, you tell McCoy that she had better check out as the best assistant I ever had. Energise.",KIRK
They've tried questioning him. He's almost agitated himself into a coma.,MCCOY
"The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the secondary level. ",SPOCK
All engines stop.,KIRK
At least let me talk to you! ,KIRK
Heart beat now approaching forty per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up. ,MCCOY
You sold tribbles on a Klingon planet? ,KIRK
"In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos. ",SPOCK
Energise. ,KIRK
That's much too low a rating. ,KIRK
He would not make a false entry. ,MCCOY
Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that. ,KIRK
And get these tribbles off the bridge. ,KIRK
"You are. I'm thinking about this ship, my crew. ",KIRK
"I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones.",KIRK
"Will be considered sufficient reason to violate the zone. We may defend ourselves,  [Sickbay]",KIRK
"Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many beliefs. ",MCCOY
What? ,KIRK
"What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields, except for impulse power, keep that in reserve? ",KIRK
"(also making a log entry) We have arrived at the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism. If we should fail in our attempt to destroy it, or be unable to free ourselves, I wish to record my recommendations for the following personnel, that they receive special citation. Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, officers Chekov, Kyle, Uhura, and my highest commendation for Commander Spock, Science Officer, who gave his life in the performance of his duty. ",KIRK
"Check the armoury, and try and free those trapped crewmen. ",KIRK
"It was close, Jim. You both barely got back alive. Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again.",MCCOY
We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's throats. ,KIRK
It must be. ,KIRK
And Korby?,KIRK
Spock to engineering. ,SPOCK
Cut that thing off. ,KIRK
"Try to raise it, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Mister Scott, how much power do we have left in the ship's batteries? ",SPOCK
"And they are of course accurate, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order.",KIRK
I don't intend to start it. ,KIRK
Your analysis seems logical. ,SPOCK
"Spock here, Captain. There seems to be a total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora. ",SPOCK
Bridge. Spock here. ,SPOCK
Of some kind. ,KIRK
"Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve  KIRK: Never mind, Mister Spock, it's no use. ",SPOCK
Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet? ,MCCOY
"Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
My compliments. ,KIRK
"I don't know what it is, exactly. She seems very vulnerable. ",MCCOY
Professor Crater! Professor Crater! ,KIRK
Nurse._ WALLACE: Jim. ,MCCOY
"It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one. ",SPOCK
"Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not? ",SPOCK
"(lying on bed) I was so worried. Your husband acting strange, crewmen dying. ",MCCOY
"Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation. ",SPOCK
Fine. Just make sure you stay ahead of it. ,KIRK
"(shivers) Oh, that's strange. That's very strange. I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place. It doesn't sound very scientific, does it? But it's strongest right here. ",KIRK
Nothing but Doctor McCoy's gloating. ,SPOCK
"I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mister Spock,  SPOCK: I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law. ",MCCOY
"Then the sooner you begin, the better. ",SPOCK
Good. Open it. ,KIRK
"Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam. Scan us. ",KIRK
Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon. ,SPOCK
Professor Crater. ,KIRK
What happened? ,MCCOY
Come over there. Well? ,KIRK
Jamie. This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter. ,KIRK
"Captain, allow me to escort this young man to his work area. ",SPOCK
Finnegan? I can't believe it. ,KIRK
"I was merely stating a fact, Doctor. ",SPOCK
What did she see? ,KIRK
You cannot go back? ,SPOCK
Kirk here. What is it? ,KIRK
Go to warp factor six. ,KIRK
"Do what you can for him, Doctor. ",KIRK
Ultrasonics. The panel. ,SPOCK
"Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Thank you.,KIRK
You mean it's functioning after all the milleniums this ship has been here? ,KIRK
And beautiful. ,MCCOY
"Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you.",SPOCK
"Well, I doubt that Mister Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Doctor Jones. ",KIRK
"Look around you, Spock. Everything is working. ",MCCOY
"Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite. How do they get their moisture? If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can. ",KIRK
Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here. ,SPOCK
This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.,KIRK
"I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem. ",MCCOY
That is true. ,SPOCK
"Andrea, give me the weapon.",KIRK
"We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld. ",KIRK
"All right, get the cutter beams on that hatch. Move. ",KIRK
"Perhaps an offering of some sort, Captain. ",SPOCK
The machine. ,SPOCK
"I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"Your recommendations, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Gentlemen, I need your help. ",KIRK
Is somebody injured? What happened? ,MCCOY
You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators? ,KIRK
Mm-hmm.,KIRK
Set course for Colony Beta Six. ,KIRK
"To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells. If there's any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman.",KIRK
Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. ,SPOCK
And most sophisticated. ,SPOCK
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres. ,SPOCK
Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion. ,SPOCK
Have Doctor McCoy beam down immediately. ,KIRK
These controls are locked. We can't disengage the computer. ,KIRK

"Well, if you're actually giving me a choice  KIRK: I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-Century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McIvers? ",MCCOY
Of course. ,KIRK
"Hold our course, Mister Hanson. ",KIRK
It was the only choice possible. You would not respect any other. ,SPOCK
You're not certain of what? ,KIRK
"Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship Farragut. Eleven years ago, you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked. According to the tapes, this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself. ",MCCOY
"Something wrong, Captain? ",SPOCK
It's unbelievable. ,MCCOY
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
Name it. ,KIRK
"Jim, what's going on down there? ",MCCOY
Is there a chance at all? ,KIRK
"They are not about to get it, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
Spock? ,KIRK
"Spock, have you seen anything like that before? ",KIRK
It's Tom Leighton. He's dead. ,KIRK
We're going to Sickbay. ,MCCOY
"Spare me the analysis, Mister Spock, please. It is enough that it works. ",MCCOY
Interesting. ,SPOCK
A lighting panel. ,KIRK
"In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest  KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert.",SPOCK
"Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors indicate no solid substance. ",SPOCK
Energy output zero. Radiation level normal. ,SPOCK
"This is the best I could do in rigging so small a communicator, sir. ",SPOCK
"Well, if you don't think you can handle it  MCCOY: Forget it. I can do it. The last thing I want around is a ham-handed ship's captain. ",KIRK
"Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two. Is that correct? ",KIRK
Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy.,SPOCK
Mister Scott? ,SPOCK
Not necessarily. ,KIRK
That's one thing we can be sure of. Death is real. ,KIRK
"James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. ",KIRK
"As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off. ",SPOCK
"Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden? ",SPOCK
If he had wanted to see Captain Pike he could have requested a leave. I would have granted it.,KIRK
"Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures, but not human.",SPOCK
Go ahead. ,KIRK
Set for a single elliptic orbit. ,KIRK
"We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill  (As holder of the only gun, Kirk leads the way into the corridors of the city.)",KIRK
"And you know where home is, Captain? ",SPOCK
Right elbow. ,MCCOY
What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship? ,KIRK
You know my name?,KIRK
Yes? ,KIRK
"That's just the negative part, Mister Spock. I've been over those records. Now the women, they're supposed to be something very special. They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that drives men wild. ",MCCOY
He is hers? ,MCCOY
"Captain, I've just had a most fascinating meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important inconsistency. ",SPOCK
Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants. ,SPOCK
"Dust, cobwebs. Halloween is right. ",MCCOY
"Neither do I, but it appears to be necessary. Energise. ",KIRK
"You're needed everywhere, Odona. ",KIRK
My duty is to stop you in any way I can. ,KIRK
If you so desire. ,SPOCK
You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty.,MCCOY
"Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions.",KIRK
Lovely. They just don't make them like that anymore. ,MCCOY
"In addition, an assortment of swords and knives. ",MCCOY
"I'm delighted to hear that, Chief. Once Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you people are going to be embarrassingly rich. ",KIRK
"Come on, Bones. ",KIRK
Do as I say. ,KIRK
His heart is different! The internal organs of a Vulcan are  CLOUD: Bring him. ,MCCOY
"Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of power. The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but the only one that preserves both sides. ",KIRK
"I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft. ",KIRK
What about Miri? ,KIRK
"Bones, I need an expert psychological opinion. Do we dare tell the people on Mantilles, try to save a few who could get away? ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, bring her to one four three mark two. Keep our forward shields to him. ",KIRK
Yes. Yes.,SPOCK
She was breathing our air. She must've gone to one of them. Show us the three Class-M planets. Mister Chekov. ,KIRK
"Magnification four, helm. ",KIRK
He must be dead. And what's going on down there on Ekos? ,MCCOY
Fascinating.,SPOCK
Get Cyrano Jones up here. ,KIRK
But no soul. ,KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
No. We'll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us. ,KIRK
Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me. (Takes his seat) But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of? ,KIRK
"Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human. ",MCCOY
"Try to warn him. If he loses power now  FARRELL: There go his engines, sir. ",KIRK
Put it down. Do what I say. ,KIRK
With ulterior motives. Does that please you? ,KIRK
"I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind. A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together. ",MCCOY
We'll try the darkroom. ,KIRK

The headbands. Look at them. ,KIRK
Evasive action. ,KIRK
The chances are very much against it. ,SPOCK
If it pleases you. This is animal flesh? ,SPOCK
"All right. Let's go find out what it is. Set your phasers on force three, to kill. We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill. ",KIRK

Activate. ,SPOCK
"Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface, Captain. ",SPOCK
"We're still alive, aren't we? ",KIRK
Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real. ,KIRK
Bones? ,KIRK
His eyes went back to normal. ,KIRK
You don't mind if we continue to try? ,SPOCK
That's strange. ,MCCOY
"An astute medical observation, Doctor, if we can believe this information. Tricorder readings indicate there is a body interred here.",SPOCK
"Spock, you're obviously not yourself. Maybe some rest. ",MCCOY
Spock to Captain. ,SPOCK
We didn't do anything like that. ,KIRK
Of course. Spock. ,KIRK
That ship was a Federation-built craft. The pilot is under our protection. ,KIRK
What? ,KIRK
"Acknowledge, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
Right. ,SPOCK
"At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen. ",MCCOY
"You said it yourself, Spock. It wants terror, not just death. ",KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. When they wake up, take them to Security holding. ",KIRK
Spock? ,MCCOY
Did you find Mister Sulu?,MCCOY
Go to Red Alert. Notify Mister Lurry. We'll be right up. ,KIRK
Lieutenant Romaine. ,KIRK

"The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet. ",SPOCK
"That is my intention, Doctor. ",MCCOY
"Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet.",KIRK

"Mister Cochrane, call the Companion. ",KIRK
Natural growths? What kind? ,KIRK
"Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear. ",MCCOY
"Do you have any ideas, Spock? ",KIRK
Set course for Delta Vega.,KIRK
"Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.",SPOCK
"Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as these might be misinterpreted. ",SPOCK
All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.,SPOCK
"You're sure, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack. ",SPOCK
"I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again, and I ordered you here. ",KIRK
I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator? ,KIRK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
"How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits? ",SPOCK
Now I know why it's called she.,KIRK
That doesn't seem likely. ,KIRK
"All right, mister. You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies.",KIRK
Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out.,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three.",KIRK
Perfect. Tyree's camp's a quarter of a mile away. ,KIRK
Are you scanning for any unusual movement? ,KIRK
"Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam? ",SPOCK
Then you're wasting your time. There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host. ,KIRK
"No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment. ",SPOCK
How? ,KIRK
"The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities. ",SPOCK
"No, but they may rest easier. ",KIRK
Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.,KIRK
"Don't you like birds, Mister Rodriguez?",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
But you didn't know that it would work. ,MCCOY
"Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears. As long as it worked, Jim. ",MCCOY
"He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them.",SPOCK
You want to make a deal. ,KIRK
But he's suffering from a severe concussion. ,MCCOY
I thank you. And my friends? ,KIRK
"Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet. ",KIRK
"I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please. ",SPOCK
It's all right. ,KIRK
"I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the responsibility will be mine. Follow me. ",SPOCK
"No, I'm not sure. I wish I was. I've done things I've never done before. I've placed my command in jeopardy. From here on I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos. ",KIRK
Go ahead. ,KIRK
"And it can continue. If only you'll allow me, I can cure you. ",KIRK
I cannot tell you how impressed I am by your splendid spirit of co-operation. ,SPOCK
"We can't keep referring to her as she, as if she weren't here. ",MCCOY
The Earth buffalo. What about it? ,SPOCK
What is it you want to tell me? ,KIRK
They'll be all right. ,KIRK
You came in a ship? ,SPOCK
Mister Scott. ,KIRK
It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear. ,SPOCK
"Kirk here. What is it, Enterprise? ",KIRK
I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence. ,SPOCK
Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. ,SPOCK
Yes. ,MCCOY
Enterprise from Kirk. ,KIRK
They don't look like the trusting type. ,KIRK
Starfleet Command may think otherwise. ,SPOCK
"There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient. ",SPOCK
"No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded.",KIRK
Explain. ,SPOCK
"(to guards) Gentlemen, I want a picture of you two with the Hero of the Fatherland listening to the stirring Fuhrer's speech. Get that light over there, please. Get this light around here. Smile, gentlemen. Turn around, smile, and now. ",KIRK

"Interesting story, Scotty. I can't tell you now because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end. Kirk out. ",KIRK
Power approaching critical. They cannot continue. ,SPOCK
You think we're being invited in? ,MCCOY
"Uhura, open the channel. ",KIRK
That'll be all. Thank you very much. ,MCCOY
Something like that. ,KIRK
I'm not finished yet. ,MCCOY
"We'll be welcome back, in twenty or thirty centuries. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I would suggest  KIRK: No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two  SPOCK: Gamma Hydra Four, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his. ",MCCOY
"Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies. ",SPOCK
"I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but  (An energy weapon blasts a hole in the wall near them) ",SPOCK
And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade? ,KIRK
"It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on Cheron. ",SPOCK
Get a crew down to transporter room three. We have twenty minutes left while we can still operate transporter controls. ,KIRK
"Towards the north-west, toward the city Scotty reported. ",KIRK
"North east. That's where we got the signal from. All right, Scotty, keep scanning. Kirk out. ",KIRK
There is something compelling about it. ,MCCOY
"You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders. You'll be busted  KIRK: I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend.",MCCOY
"He's dead, Captain. ",MCCOY
A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it. ,SPOCK
Just one thing. There is a third member of our group. ,KIRK
"(reading from a newspaper pinned up) October 26, 1881. Tombstone, Arizona. ",KIRK
I transported him myself. ,SPOCK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
And now. ,SPOCK
"Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds, and there's no need to check your records.",SPOCK
"Not if he cloned a new copy of himself every so often to carry on the search. Remember, he said he was Keniclius Five. ",KIRK
And you can bet those Romulan ships will be gunning for us. ,KIRK
Or I will be killed. ,KIRK
Dead. I don't understand it. My phaser wasn't set to kill. ,KIRK
"One uses the resources at hand, Captain. Watch now. (stands in the pentangle) I will attempt to move a Vulcan chess piece magically.",SPOCK
"Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies? ",MCCOY
"Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her. Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work. ",KIRK
"Our crewman died of salt depletion. Sudden, total loss of it.",MCCOY
When we first materialised. ,KIRK
"Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've got this far. ",SPOCK
Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any sightings or sensor readings in their area. ,KIRK
Nothing lethal about light. ,MCCOY
"The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life. ",SPOCK
"If she is to survive, we can't attack. ",KIRK
Stand back. ,KIRK
On the double. ,KIRK
"I don't know, Jim. ",MCCOY
(looks at monitor) You? Spinoza? ,KIRK
"Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony. ",KIRK
Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved. ,SPOCK
"Prepare phaser banks one and two, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end. ",SPOCK
We're all getting away. ,KIRK
"It's time for action, gentlemen. Mister Bailey  BAILEY: Bridge to Phaser Gun Crew KIRK: Countermand. I'll select what kind of action.",KIRK
"A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable. ",SPOCK
Put it on audio. ,KIRK
I have an idea. What if he is really Apollo? ,KIRK
"He's all yours, Plum. Doctor McCoy. ",KIRK
Obviously a man of good taste. ,KIRK
What are they? ,KIRK
The M-5 must be destroyed. ,KIRK
"On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty.",KIRK
"Mister Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant? ",KIRK
"(into communicator) That's right, Lieutenant. Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I want it for. I just want it! Now move! ",MCCOY
I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is illogical. ,SPOCK
You don't have the choice. ,MCCOY
"I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all. ",SPOCK
"As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up. ",KIRK
There must be no delay. ,KIRK
You've not yet explained the nature of this thing. ,SPOCK
"Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger. ",SPOCK
"Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now  KIRK: Now they're back to normal. ",SPOCK
Why? Because your people have nothing of your own? Is that why you need us? ,KIRK
"Well, drink it down, Spock. It's the human thing to do. That's a medical order, Captain. ",MCCOY
Regarding our patients? ,MCCOY
"I would, but unfortunately we're out of communications range. ",KIRK
"Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. (into communicator as Kirk joins him.) Spock to Enterprise. ",SPOCK
"If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the only thing that might convince her. ",KIRK
Everyone accounted for? ,KIRK
"I resist that suggestion, Commodore. ",SPOCK
"Captain Kirk, I presume. ",SPOCK
Mudd. And he has Christine. She's in danger. My love. ,SPOCK
Yes. That would answer a lot of questions. ,KIRK
"Captain, transporter operational, but just barely. ",SPOCK
How?,KIRK
Controls activated. ,KIRK
"That is, of course, your affair. Captain, may I inquire if you intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the Halkans? ",SPOCK
Energise.,KIRK
"Perhaps you can, Mister  ATOZ: Mister Atoz. I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you. I had thought that everyone had long since gone.",KIRK
"Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into quadrant nine oh four. Beta Six is eight days distant. ",SPOCK
Spock out.,SPOCK
"Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin? ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
You? What happened before you came here? Try to remember. It's important. ,KIRK
Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids. ,SPOCK
"Very well indeed, thank you, Captain. ",SPOCK
Can he do it? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, send a security team to the pressure doors on the hangar deck. ",KIRK
He had his escape planned. I'm glad he made it. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
There is no need. ,SPOCK
"According to our computer files, Jones, you are in violation of three Federation mandates and forty seven local ones. You're confined until we complete our mission. Then we'll turn you over to the proper authorities. ",KIRK
"All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge. Keep me posted.",KIRK
This is Spock. ,SPOCK
What has happened? ,KIRK
"If they're all right, they should've reported in. ",MCCOY
Scanner readings? ,KIRK
Belay that order. I'll stay here. ,KIRK
"Spock, you've got something? ",KIRK
"Energise, Captain. ",SPOCK
You refer to the humanoid? ,SPOCK
"Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps, he'd still tend to protect that child. ",MCCOY
Please commence. I'll explain. ,SPOCK
"Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull. ",KIRK
"Too late. All of this, just an illusion. ",MCCOY
"Dead, Jim. Strange. A red mottling all over his face. ",MCCOY
"Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command. Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon. ",SPOCK
"Wrong again, Oxmyx. ",KIRK
"That is the problem, sir. ",KIRK
"You could learn something from Mister Spock, Doctor. Stop thinking with your glands. We've equipment aboard the Enterprise that could pinpoint a match lit anywhere on this planet, or the heat of a body. Transporter room, Kirk speaking. Three to beam up.",KIRK
Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant. ,SPOCK
"We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries.",KIRK
Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below? ,MCCOY
"Scotty, that bomb he planted. Can you dismantle it? ",KIRK
It worked. ,KIRK
I say I'm Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Who are you? ,KIRK
Which is? ,KIRK
Jim. ,MCCOY
I'll check her out. Maybe I can help. ,MCCOY
This is crazy. Our own computer's declared war on us and I haven't the slightest idea why. ,KIRK
"We've triggered something, all right. His heart beat's increasing. Now passing eight beats per minute. There are some signs of respiration beginning. ",MCCOY
Of course. But there's something so very disturbing about her. ,MCCOY
"Kirk here. How are they holding out, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Captain, are you all right? ",SPOCK
"Kirk to Enterprise, come in. ",KIRK
"It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not show. ",SPOCK
"Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive. ",SPOCK
Spock here.,SPOCK
"Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
"Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment. ",KIRK
"Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse. ",MCCOY
"My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Weren't orbital nuclear devices one of this era's greatest problems? ,KIRK
"The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick! ",KIRK
But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them? ,KIRK
"Stand by, Scotty. ",KIRK
You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license. ,KIRK
"Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain. ",SPOCK
Why risk your life for his? ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately.",SPOCK
Energise. ,KIRK
"Status report, Scotty. ",KIRK
Then bypass the relays and go to manual control. ,SPOCK
"Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out. ",SPOCK
"Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure. ",SPOCK
I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts. ,SPOCK
Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on.,KIRK
"Opinion, Mister Walking Bear. ",KIRK
"They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore, for shore leave. They've assured me that our people will have a wonderful time. ",KIRK
"Ah, yes. Take care of that oversight, will you, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"Where is he? Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom?",KIRK
For one thing it means we're stranded. ,KIRK
Jim? Are you all right? ,MCCOY
"At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain. ",SPOCK
I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man? ,MCCOY
How? ,MCCOY
Let's go. ,KIRK
And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered. ,KIRK
"You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders. ",KIRK
"No doubt, Captain. ",SPOCK
"But dilithium molecules are the hardest, most rigid  GABLER: Mister Scott! More trouble with the circuit work. ",KIRK
"I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines. ",MCCOY
You've killed thousands of her children. ,KIRK
"There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further. ",SPOCK
You're not Andorian. Who are you? ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel.",KIRK
"All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship. ",KIRK
Fine time to ring the dinner bell. ,MCCOY
Request opening in your force field for beaming down of cargo.,KIRK
"You did, long ago, when it was needed most. Our people were children then. Kukulkan, we've grown up now. We don't need you anymore.",KIRK
"Scotty, I need your approval, too. Since you'll work with them, furnishing them all they need to make the android robots. ",KIRK
"Yes, Eleen. Remarkable young lady. ",KIRK
"Then use your imagination. Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines. Discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out of there with the main section, but get that ship out of there! ",KIRK
"His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya. ",MCCOY
Co-ordinates? ,KIRK
"But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear? ",KIRK
What is it you want? ,KIRK
"We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air. ",SPOCK
Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated. ,SPOCK
Where's Mister Seven? ,KIRK
You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation? ,KIRK
"No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments. ",SPOCK
Both. How many of these did Uhura give you? ,KIRK
Then reverse mutation is possible. ,KIRK
"I believe it is not a natural object, but a ship. ",SPOCK
(checking tablets) Salt. ,MCCOY
Too quickly. Bridge. ,KIRK
You all right? ,KIRK
And Mister Spock? ,KIRK
There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement.,SPOCK
Any reply?,KIRK
"The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock. Care to join the landing party, Doctor? ",KIRK
Results also negative. ,MCCOY
"(coming in from rear compartment) This should save us at least fifty pounds, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Yes, he did your job. ",KIRK
Ninety? ,KIRK
He's sneaked power down a bit.,SPOCK
"Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel. That's only a matter of judgment. ",KIRK
But that could take days. ,MCCOY
"Go through the transporter, both of us. ",KIRK
Done. (they shake on it) What do we do? ,KIRK
"Jim, you don't mean you're going to abandon the mapping mission to check out some meaningless signal? ",MCCOY
Tapping its energy cells. ,KIRK
"I have them, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen, search in progress.",SPOCK
Scotty. ,MCCOY
"Yes, well, I don't make those decisions. Mister Lurry is in charge of those matters. ",KIRK
Like yourselves. ,KIRK
"We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command. ",KIRK
"To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory. ",SPOCK
What? ,MCCOY
"Thirty seconds ago, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. ",KIRK
We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship. ,KIRK
Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports? ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Television was the colloquial term. ,SPOCK
"Yes, and the food they have gathered is Bem. ",KIRK
"Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable. ",MCCOY
"Easy now. Oh, he's caught it! ",MCCOY
How do you know? ,KIRK
"Make sure it does, Spock. If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them. ",KIRK
(a whisper) You gave them to the Klingons? ,KIRK
"Or what he felt. Damage report, Scotty? ",KIRK
Unusual eye arrangement. I might've known he'd turn up with something like that. ,MCCOY
"Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One hundred percent dispersal pattern. ",KIRK
"Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death. ",KIRK
"Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians. ",SPOCK
Which supports a theory I've been formulating. ,SPOCK
Your actions all but lost us our ship. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment. ",KIRK
"Very well. I order you to release crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura immediately. ",KIRK
"I cannot tell you at this time, sir.",SPOCK
"Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly. ",SPOCK
I suspected you would go. You are worried about the kahs-wan ordeal. ,SPOCK
You and your Garden of Eden. ,MCCOY
"No, Miramanee, there's no one else in my mind or my heart. ",KIRK
"And my dear friend Scotty. And that pretty little Lieutenant Uhura. I've saved just about everybody on this here ship. If the Enterprise had a heart, I'd save her too. Now, let's talk about your heart, my dear. ",MCCOY
And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.,SPOCK
"Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits. ",SPOCK
"That's enough, Charlie. ",KIRK
And they were correct. I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise. ,SPOCK
"Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the moment  SPOCK: I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action.",KIRK
What about the comet that astrophysics reported? ,KIRK
Bridge to Sickbay. Casualty report. ,KIRK
"Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations. ",KIRK
"Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians? ",SPOCK
Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able to patch together again? ,MCCOY
Thank you. ,KIRK
Fascinating. No world in the Federation has produced anything so powerful. Almost beyond theoretical limits. Total conversion of matter to energy at a distance. ,SPOCK
"Understood, Captain. Transporter room. ",SPOCK
"But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take it. ",KIRK
"It was not deliberate, I assure you. ",KIRK
That could be what destroyed him. ,KIRK
Why not all three? ,KIRK
"Well, unless they treat their tribbles too, that ship isn't going to be big enough for all of them. ",MCCOY
Captain. ,SPOCK
Jim. This is senseless. I've thought it over. I'm staying. ,MCCOY
Main screen. Extreme magnification. ,KIRK
"One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred  KIRK: Never mind. But thanks. Kaplan, take the post. ",SPOCK
"Yes, she is. And you've been out of circulation quite a while.",KIRK
"Full ahead. All decks, condition red. ",KIRK
"At another place in time, I think. If we check closely, I believe we'll find many of those ships are the ones designated as lost in the Delta Triangle. ",KIRK
He's cut off both helm and power.,KIRK
"I can afford even less to lose the Enterprise. Open the hailing frequency again, Lieutenant. Captain Koloth. I'm going to give you one last chance to release the Enterprise. ",KIRK
It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice. ,MCCOY
"Make it fast, Ben. I may have to go to Red Alert. ",KIRK
You're off course. I'm coming right up. ,KIRK
Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children? ,KIRK
I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible. ,KIRK
His neck was broken. By an expert. ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation? ",KIRK
"Spock, ask Scotty how long it would take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks. ",KIRK
You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory? ,KIRK
"I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in a shuttle craft. ",SPOCK
"A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it. ",MCCOY
"You have less than two hours, Councilman. ",KIRK
Let me speak to you! ,KIRK
That's right. ,KIRK
The fool. Starfleet should be made aware. ,KIRK
"I register a disturbance, Captain. As if an impulse just passed through the ship. ",SPOCK
"The so-called girl is a Rigelian hypnoid, projecting a simple illusion. ",SPOCK
Oh? ,KIRK
Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him. ,KIRK
He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't get in here and talk to me. ,KIRK
"It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful. ",SPOCK
Me? I don't want the job. ,KIRK
"Look out, Jim! ",MCCOY
It petrifies me. ,KIRK
"Well, he has a magnetism. Almost electric. You felt it. And it could over power McGivers with her preoccupation with the past. ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Execute. ,KIRK
"Your instincts are still good, Mister Spock. The captain is dead.",MCCOY
Hold your fire. ,KIRK
"A short time, Mister Spock. We have very little. ",KIRK
But I don't know how. ,MCCOY
"Spock, I, er, I'm sorry. It does hurt, doesn't it? ",MCCOY
"When in doubt, the book prevails, Mister Spock. I've run tests.",MCCOY
Not with the Earps. There is one other place I can try. ,KIRK
It would seem so. ,SPOCK
Bridge to transporter room. ,KIRK
Out! ,KIRK
Is that door secure? ,KIRK
"Spock, are you slumping? ",KIRK
This is Captain James Tiberius Kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet. Do you hear me? Kirk to entity. Kirk to entity. ,KIRK
"Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim. ",SPOCK
Bring them in. ,KIRK
"Yes, er, incredible. ",KIRK
Killing Lieutenant Romaine? ,KIRK
Intelligence different from ours or superior?,KIRK
True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them.,SPOCK
This communicator's been on my belt since we beamed down. ,KIRK
I was preoccupied. ,KIRK
Who are you? ,KIRK
And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship. ,MCCOY
"Jim  SPOCK: Captain, I  KIRK: Gentlemen, I'll decide.",MCCOY
Blind panic. ,KIRK
"Landru, answer the question. ",KIRK
"This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility, violent intentions. ",SPOCK
"All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be fairly heavy displacement. ",SPOCK
"Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs. Tell them, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite consignment. ,KIRK
"May I remind you, we did not intend to fight. ",SPOCK
Please do. ,SPOCK
"All right, Mister Scott, energise. ",KIRK
"That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov. ",SPOCK
"None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves? ",SPOCK
"Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture past glory. ",MCCOY
Let's get out of here. ,KIRK
"My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt. (Scott is continuing to work) The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty. ",SPOCK
A message from three hundred million years ago? ,MCCOY
Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel. ,SPOCK
She seems fine now. ,MCCOY
We? ,KIRK
Positive identification? ,KIRK
"Can you give us your present location, Captain? ",SPOCK
"In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone. The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday. ",KIRK
"Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead. ",KIRK
And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed? ,KIRK
How can a planet full of people just disappear? ,MCCOY
"Captain, there it is. ",SPOCK
"A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct. ",SPOCK
"I want a complete medical examination, Bones. Something's just happened  MCCOY: I'm afraid I'll have to make it later today, Captain. I have too many tests to process right now. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Arex, activate main screen, extreme magnification. ",KIRK
McCoy out. ,MCCOY
Energise. ,KIRK
Oh. You will pardon us. ,MCCOY
Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider. ,MCCOY
"Good, Scotty. Continue scanning. We'll maintain transmission.",KIRK
A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age. ,KIRK
"Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus, like a a plant parasite. It's the nearest biological form of life I can find. ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about? ",KIRK
But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky. ,KIRK
"We are considered simplistic, but in the process of evolving into a higher order. ",SPOCK
(to redshirts) Try again. See if you can find anything outside.,KIRK
Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? ,SPOCK
What caused the red alert? ,KIRK
"I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship. ",KIRK
"Captain, scientifically  KIRK: You'll both be filing reports. Make your comments and recommendations then.",SPOCK
Do we have emergency warp? ,KIRK
"Go ahead, Doctor. Put the Teacher on. ",KIRK
"I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started the fight? ",KIRK
"I have the autopsy report on Marvick. Heart action stopped, cause unknown. Respiration stopped, cause unknown.",MCCOY
"In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock. ",MCCOY
You must help us. You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken. ,KIRK
"Your figures are, of course, accurate. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button.",KIRK
I'll discuss that only with him. ,KIRK
"Captain, we must get off this bridge. ",SPOCK
What's the problem? ,KIRK
Bones! ,KIRK
Affirmative. It fled the ship when it thought we would crash into the dead star. ,SPOCK
Get ready to move. We've got to follow Spock inside that trapdoor. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus Three. One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.",KIRK
"Spock to Enterprise, come in. ",SPOCK
Can we discuss it here? ,MCCOY
You issued a priority one distress call for a couple of tons of wheat? ,KIRK
"Due to your error, Mister Kyle? ",SPOCK
Good. Then you wouldn't mind if we looked around? ,KIRK
Why not? ,KIRK
Got to get McCoy. ,KIRK
He beamed up to the ship with us. ,KIRK
Not alone. I'm taking some security people with me. ,KIRK
Jim. ,MCCOY
"Stand by your phasers, Mister Spock. Prepare to fire on my signal. Kirk out. ",KIRK
That planet it is a myth. ,KIRK
"Yes, we can. ",KIRK
"This is very curious, Captain. It computes as a strange combination of matter and energy. ",SPOCK
Spock! ,KIRK
That's not so. He was my friend. ,KIRK
You're right. He's not one of us. ,KIRK
I'm a stranger. ,KIRK
We go together or not at all. ,SPOCK
Let's go. ,KIRK
"No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the early symptoms. There'll be more. ",MCCOY
"I understand the feeling, Captain. ",SPOCK
Bob. Is the evacuation proceeding? ,KIRK
"Several times, Captain. I do not wish to surrender hope, but the facts remain unchangeable. ",SPOCK
We can take an educated guess. At the point we entered their solar system. ,KIRK
"You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk. ",KIRK
"And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now.",MCCOY
Kirk here. What is it? ,KIRK
"No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain.",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, do you verify? ",SPOCK
How is she? ,KIRK
Good. Repeat procedure for maximum effect. ,KIRK
Impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis. ,SPOCK
"I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper  KIRK: Spock, just press the right button. ",SPOCK
"Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum. Let's go get some answers.",KIRK
"It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge. ",SPOCK
To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass. ,SPOCK
"Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with. ",SPOCK
Where is he? ,KIRK
How much time do we have? ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
What's this? ,MCCOY
"It's now very clear you know each other extremely well, gentlemen. The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together. It is not a battlefield. ",KIRK
Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant contentment. ,SPOCK
What? What? What's quadrotriticale? (Lurry hands him a small packet) Wheat. So what? ,KIRK
Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat. ,SPOCK
"Yes, but terraforming usually follows a pattern. This seems like random choice. ",KIRK
Oh. (sitting up) My neck feels like it's been twisted off. ,KIRK
"You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help. And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees. You might enjoy it. You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours. That's what we call freedom. You'll like it, a lot. And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be. Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other. That's what we call love. You'll like that, too, a lot. You and your children. ",KIRK
"Scotty, we've got six.",KIRK
"Henoch, your condition? ",KIRK
"Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise? ",KIRK
"I had hoped to meet your father, here, tonight, personally. ",KIRK
To be so obsessed. ,MCCOY
"This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. ",SPOCK
"The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger. ",SPOCK
Shuttlecraft? ,KIRK
Hold it. It's a communication device. ,KIRK
It's a tri-ox compound. It'll help you breathe. Now be careful! ,MCCOY
"There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's symbols. They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing. ",SPOCK
I know every sound that this ship might make. That's coming from outside. ,KIRK
"I'm in command, Bones. It makes it my fault. How do you fight a thing like that? ",KIRK
Computer. Criminological files. Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper. ,KIRK
"Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays. ",SPOCK
"Gary, forgive me. ",KIRK
"Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine. ",MCCOY
I can't seem to stand up. ,KIRK
Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed is still increasing. ,SPOCK
"Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want?",MCCOY
"You said they were imitative, and the book  OXMYX: I don't want any more cracks about the Book. ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant, let's see what the scanners have come up with on the cloud's composition. ",KIRK
By killing seven innocent men. ,KIRK
A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms aboard. ,SPOCK
"He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd. ",KIRK
It's faster than walking. ,KIRK
Spock? ,MCCOY
McCoy to Bridge. Captain there? ,MCCOY
And they'll get their answers if it kills us. ,KIRK
All right. All right. ,KIRK
"You're frightening her, Jim.",MCCOY
Yes. Why? ,KIRK
"Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go. ",MCCOY
"Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it, if we can. Well, let's not disappoint the chess master. Phasers on full. ",KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
"Scan us and lock on to us. It's going to be close. Very, very close. Stand by. Stand by, Enterprise. ",KIRK
You still haven't made any recommendation. ,KIRK
Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary. ,KIRK
Scanners operative on the planet's surface? ,KIRK
"I can't identify it without a medi-comp. Without knowing, an antidote would be dangerous. ",MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, what is our position? ",SPOCK
Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise. ,KIRK
You don't think you're going? ,MCCOY
A miniscule. A very small piece. ,SPOCK
Will it take us to McCoy? ,KIRK
That's only one shield. ,KIRK
I've loved you.,KIRK
Hang on. D'Amato's section. Come in. Kirk to D'Amato. Come in.,KIRK
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You'll go up with the doctor. ,KIRK
We'll bombard the unpopulated pressure areas with phaser beams and change the epicentre of the quake so it won't endanger your people or your city. ,KIRK
"All that bloodshed for nothing. That'll be sufficient, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice an odour of any kind? Rizzo. Rizzo! Do you remember a sickly sweet odour? Did you smell it? ",KIRK
"Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant. These could be useful. Just remember one thing. To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers. ",KIRK
"Dismissed, Doctor. ",KIRK
"Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there anything we can do? ",MCCOY
Put it down. ,KIRK
You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?,SPOCK
"It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed. Is that correct? ",SPOCK
"Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits. ",SPOCK
Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative. ,SPOCK
We're less cold-blooded about it than you are. ,KIRK
Can you do anything for her? ,KIRK
"Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living  DEELA: Burns them out. ",KIRK
"If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems. ",KIRK
"Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take a minute. ",MCCOY
Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.,SPOCK
"Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty, Spock, stand by in the transporter room. ",KIRK
"I'll let you know when I have the results. And from now on, it would be better if I handled the instruments without your help. ",MCCOY
This is no time for a vendetta. Maintain your post. ,KIRK
About as much as a mother learns from a six month old infant. ,SPOCK
"My First Officer, Commander Spock. ",KIRK
"Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women. ",KIRK
"Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service. ",SPOCK
Captain. ,MCCOY
report to Mister Spock for assignment.,KIRK
Andromeda? Why? ,KIRK
"All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it.",KIRK
Let's have it. The truth this time. ,KIRK
"Stop it! Stop it, Spock! Stop it! (Nancy sends Spock flying with one slap) ",MCCOY
"No evidence of life, subspace interference level incredibly high. ",SPOCK
"Oh, yes. ",KIRK
Take all action necessary to protect the ship. We'll hold out here. ,KIRK
Kirk here. What is it? ,KIRK
"That's not enough, Rojan. ",KIRK
"Then we've got to distract him and give Spock some time. Bones, what would happen if we pulled the cables on some of these cages. ",KIRK
"Assuming it's a spy weapon then, the Slavers would have wanted to keep it a secret weapon. If so, it is logical to assume it has a self-destruct setting too. ",SPOCK
If an alien needed a body. ,KIRK
We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them. ,KIRK
But our people have phaser number two. ,KIRK
I had no idea that history was your specialty. ,KIRK
Of course. ,KIRK
Good. Go to Yellow Alert. ,KIRK
"No, Jim. You can't do it. ",MCCOY
How long does the knowledge last? ,KIRK
"The kahs-wan, a survival test traditional for young males. ",SPOCK
"Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu. Adjust. ",KIRK
Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced such a race of beings? ,KIRK
For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the devil you keep from punching me in the face.,MCCOY
He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy? ,KIRK
"Yes, sir.",SPOCK
"Stand by for check. Scotty, we're still off course. ",KIRK
"Captain, I must assume command. You are no longer able to command the Enterprise.",SPOCK
Let me go. ,KIRK
"All right. Try to relax. Jim, it's started, the fever. It's over a hundred, and it's climbing. ",MCCOY
They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician. ,KIRK
"The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered. ",MCCOY
I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me. ,MCCOY
Emergency channel D.,SPOCK
Is not to be injured. ,KIRK
We're being drawn right into it. ,MCCOY
Fire into it immediately! ,KIRK
The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead. ,KIRK
"I have a theory, Captain, but first I suggest that if Officer Scott moves away from the computer, it might feel less threatened. ",SPOCK
"Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work. ",MCCOY
Logical. ,SPOCK
"Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy? ",SPOCK
Put him on. ,KIRK
Energise. ,KIRK
Record tape. Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here. ,KIRK
My father is from the planet Vulcan. ,SPOCK
"Disengage computer control, Uhura.",KIRK
"History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them. ",KIRK
Release my ship. ,KIRK
"Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship. And nothing is more important than my ship. ",KIRK
"I'm afraid our navigational co-ordinates mean very little here, Lieutenant. My readings indicate we are not in time and space as we understand it. Doctor, these readings may interest you. ",SPOCK
"You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine. ",KIRK
Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front of a captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy? ,KIRK
We are from the United Federation of Planets. ,KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
One hundred thousand kilometres. They should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds. ,SPOCK
You'd think they had people beaming down every day. ,KIRK
It would seem so. ,KIRK
"Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn. ",KIRK
"Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Green. ,SPOCK
All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones. ,KIRK
We'd be delighted. ,KIRK
"Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in Apollo's chest could have something to do with the transmission of energy? ",KIRK
"Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately.",SPOCK
How old is this thing? ,KIRK
"We were not spying, Commander. ",KIRK
Vulcans never bluff. ,SPOCK
"Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral. Well, we're going to wait right here until well after five o'clock. We're not going to move from this spot. ",KIRK
"Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to it. ",SPOCK
"Perhaps you've heard, let's say, an impossible story or a rumour of men who came from the sky or from other worlds. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, come with me. Scotty. ",KIRK
It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town. ,SPOCK
U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.,KIRK
The child? ,SPOCK
"You're very welcome, Mister Spock. But no human can look at Kollos, even with a visor, without going mad. How do you manage? ",KIRK
Is it permitted? ,KIRK
"You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Ah, yes. I understand. Well, I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting. ",KIRK
Put it on ship's speaker. ,KIRK
"I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured.",SPOCK
"All scanners, extreme sweep. ",KIRK
Yes? ,MCCOY
"You? Yes, I can see that. Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship. ",KIRK
"That's a course of self-destruction. Lieutenant Uhura, open hailing frequencies. I want to talk to that ship's captain. ",KIRK
"But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this Enterprise, Mister Spock. Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans and make it stick. Push till it gives. You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet. ",KIRK
Did you operate on Spock in time? ,KIRK
I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act. When was that? ,KIRK
Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos.,KIRK
"Go on, get on with it, Harry. ",KIRK
No. ,KIRK
"Who, me? ",MCCOY
That we have immobilized your ship worse than you have immobilized ours. ,KIRK
No dizziness? No sweating? No palpitations? ,MCCOY
"Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I read my Spocks correctly. ",KIRK
"And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too much from him.",MCCOY
"Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?",SPOCK
"Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed. ",SPOCK
"He's not trying to kill us, he's trying to frighten us, and he's doing a pretty good job.",KIRK
"Right here, Miss Hedford. ",MCCOY
"All right, Scotty, let's have it. ",KIRK
Are you certain? ,KIRK
The others are on the patio. ,KIRK
"I am forced to contest that, Commodore. I want to see more.",KIRK
What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events. ,SPOCK
But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something. ,KIRK
"Don't you believe in male androids, Harry? ",KIRK
"Insufficient mass, sir. ",SPOCK
"Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation. ",KIRK
"I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere. Not too much deck tennis, no frantic dancing, and no responsibility. Why me? I look around that Bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next move. And Bones, what if I'm wrong? ",KIRK
"I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part? (a nod) I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species.",SPOCK
"Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight? ",KIRK
That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.,KIRK
Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death. ,SPOCK
"Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful. ",KIRK
"If we can reach it before the cloud gets to Mantilles, we might be able to save the planet. We'll use the photon torpedoes to destroy the brain. ",KIRK
"I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov.",KIRK
I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos. ,KIRK
Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died. All right. All right.,KIRK
"Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver you leave much to be desired. ",SPOCK
"I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings. ",SPOCK
"All right, it's up to you. Take us to Landru. ",KIRK
Contact established with Doctor Korby. ,KIRK
What about the Keeper of the planet. Did anyone see him? ,KIRK
Where are they? ,MCCOY
"Checkmate, Commander. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development. ",SPOCK
We'll receive no help from the Organians. ,SPOCK
"Joy to you, friend. Peace and contentment will fill you. You will know the peace of Landru. ",KIRK
Whom do you serve now? ,SPOCK
What are you waiting for? Hurry! ,KIRK
"As of this date, lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship. ",MCCOY
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott, start repairs. Install the auxiliary controls. ",KIRK
Total reply if attacked. So that's the answer. Klingons. ,KIRK
"Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under observation. ",SPOCK
We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection. ,KIRK
He would have been rather difficult to stop. ,KIRK
"We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go.",KIRK
Are you sure about that? ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark eight. ",KIRK
"Message to the inhabitants of the city on the planet below. I hope you can receive this frequency and understand my words. Your survival depends on it. All this ship's armament is locked on the co-ordinates of your city. A demonstration, in case you doubt. ",KIRK
"He gambled, I won. ",KIRK
"Power astern, half speed.",KIRK
"Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane.",SPOCK
Mister Sulu. ,KIRK
Computer don't kill a half million people. ,KIRK
Why you? ,KIRK
They what? ,KIRK
"They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain.",SPOCK
On my way. All duty personnel on Yellow Alert. Don't alarm the passengers. Kirk out.,KIRK
"They did fail to indicate the large marine creature that attacked us. Perhaps the readings are incomplete, blocked by underwater pressure forces. Oceans are less turbulent at greater depth. Such conditions would be more suitable to intelligent forms. ",SPOCK
"It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen. Every nerve ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing torn, no bleeding. It's a medical miracle. ",MCCOY
"Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate.",SPOCK
"Nor do I, Mister Scott, but we've got to do it. Sherman's Planet needs that grain desperately. ",KIRK
"It's regaining consciousness. Surface, Mister Clayton. ",KIRK
"You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not words. They are musical notes. ",SPOCK
I think we're in what corresponds to the small intestine. Those things growing out of the wall would be similar to villi. ,MCCOY
"We've got four minutes, maybe five.",KIRK
"There was nothing to spare. I shall continue my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it. ",SPOCK
"Is it the captain, Mister Spock?",MCCOY
At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you. ,KIRK
Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting. ,MCCOY
"Helen. Helen, for years I've loved you. Helen. ",KIRK
Not on my ship. ,KIRK
"All right, what have we got to work with? ",KIRK
"Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity. ",KIRK
"Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it would be about here. ",MCCOY
"Well, there are better things for men and women to do. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims. ",SPOCK
"Explain, Spock. ",KIRK
"And best of all, no practical jokes. ",MCCOY
"Captain's log, supplemental. Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and reenergised. ",KIRK
You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not. ,KIRK
"This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. We've contacted your buoy and understand its message. We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you. Lieutenant, answer? ",KIRK
"Lieutenant, have Mister Scott beam down the phaser bore and (static) ",KIRK
"Jim, don't you think KIRK: What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me.",MCCOY
"What's on, Jim? ",MCCOY
Sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted. They probably don't have the strength for a prolonged battle now. ,SPOCK
And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara. ,KIRK
Yes. That way. ,KIRK
"Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew. Did you hear the sound of human integrity? ",KIRK
Sounds like a horror story. Suppose there's any truth in it? ,MCCOY
"I keep wondering who might be after us in a shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be right, can l, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
We will level your planet and take what we want. That is destruction. You will die as a race. ,KIRK
"How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you? ",SPOCK
She's dead. ,MCCOY
"Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares? ",SPOCK
"Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do. ",MCCOY
"Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
"The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling behind. ",SPOCK
"Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor.",SPOCK
All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple turns. Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes closed. ,KIRK
"Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.",KIRK
This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body. ,SPOCK
"One moment, Lieutenant. Mister Sulu, on my command, I want you to turn the Enterprise and head for the exact co-ordinates where the Klingon ship disappeared. Warp eight. ",KIRK
Jim. ,MCCOY
And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take. ,KIRK
"And if they're real, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Move aside, Bones. ",KIRK
"Garden of Eden, with land mines. ",KIRK
What are they? ,KIRK
Undoubtedly. ,SPOCK
Strange. ,KIRK
Suspended animation. ,KIRK
We all saw him. The Captain's still alive. ,MCCOY
"Go ahead, Scotty. ",KIRK
Fortunate. We will vacate at once. ,KIRK
You were correct in your feel. The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision. ,SPOCK
"Have Doctor McCoy's report channeled to my quarters, Lieutenant.",KIRK
"Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not entirely successful. ",SPOCK
"You know nothing about our kind. You know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks. Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you. We've come a long way in five thousand years. ",KIRK
Intelligent? ,KIRK
"Security, this is the captain. Find Mister Chekov and bring him to the bridge. ",KIRK
But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral? ,SPOCK
"Captain, several people approaching. ",SPOCK
"A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda? You're young, attractive and human. Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself, someone who isn't ugly. ",KIRK
"The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a remarkable instrument. ",SPOCK
How's Sarek? ,KIRK
Composition? ,SPOCK
"Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. ",SPOCK
"We took no action against your ship, Kang. ",KIRK
"It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged, repaired each other, became one. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, we have a patient for Doctor McCoy. Have Scotty beam us up. ",KIRK
Spock! Much further? ,KIRK
As her husband? ,KIRK
More of you? How many? ,KIRK
"No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough examination, and you're ill. In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay, you're going to die. ",KIRK
"But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent, runaways? ",KIRK
"Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.",KIRK
Even from here I can tell his pulse rate's up. ,MCCOY
"I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a grey hair on her head. ",MCCOY
Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms. ,SPOCK
"Something corresponding to that. The records say every ship lost here vanished without a trace. Most logged communication loss and disorientation just before disappearance. My guess was they entered a window to some other continuum. Comments, Spock? ",KIRK
Now certainly you understand our feelings about that. ,MCCOY
Don't you have a mate? ,KIRK
That means only organic matter is affected. But how? ,MCCOY
There is enough loose rock and shale. ,SPOCK
"That's only one down, Doctor. There's over four hundred more up there in orbit. And if there's a Klingon down here, there might be a Klingon ship up there somewhere. ",KIRK
"I don't have to, Bones. We both know he is. ",KIRK
Why not? ,KIRK
"Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane? ",KIRK
"Her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save Spock's sanity, perhaps even his life. ",MCCOY
That is correct. ,SPOCK
"What's our position, navigator? ",KIRK
Good. Did you find out anything? ,KIRK
I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect.,KIRK
"You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build facilities. ",KIRK
You made contact? ,SPOCK
"You may believe what you like, Commander. We were fired upon first and returned fire. The Klothos deflectors turned aside our phaser fire and then disappeared. I don't know why. But we are in the Delta Triangle. ",KIRK
"Well, I won't strike you again. You've been following us, watching us. Why? ",KIRK
Have you tried all hailing frequencies?,KIRK
"If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late. ",KIRK
"When I get my hands on the clown who's behind all this, I'll put him in Sickbay for a week. ",MCCOY
"That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death. ",SPOCK
Are there others on this planet? ,KIRK
"They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with luck, we'll be gone. ",SPOCK
Spock. Are you all right? ,KIRK
"Receiving transmissions from Talos Four? Then the images we've been seeing are SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.",KIRK
"You saw how capricious he is. Benevolent one minute, angry the next. One more wrong move from her and he could kill her. ",MCCOY
Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems. ,SPOCK
No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo. ,SPOCK
How long do we have? ,KIRK
"(signing a PADD) Thank you, Mister Mulney. ",KIRK
"McCoy. McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy.",KIRK
Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone. It's my fault Mitchell got as far as he did. Did you see their direction? ,KIRK
"There's no data, no starting point. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command. Advise them of our situation. Include all log entries to this point. ",KIRK
"Yes, they can. ",KIRK
Security. ,KIRK
Spock would have some logical reason for going there.,KIRK
"Back to that planet? Without warp speed, it'll take months, Spock. ",MCCOY
"Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Trelane, let him go. ",KIRK
Let's go. ,KIRK
"I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you. ",SPOCK
The commander? ,KIRK
"Forgive me, Mister Spock. I should have known better. ",KIRK
"It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor. Fascinating. ",SPOCK
"Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney in a hard roll for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you. Mister Spock, this bag does not contain platinum, silver or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future. ",KIRK
"Good. I've got a personal grudge against that rabbit, Jim. ",MCCOY
"It's not necessary, Mister Spock. I know exactly where the creature is. ",KIRK
"Look, Bones, I need your help. Can you run tests, blood samples, anything at all to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them? ",KIRK
We'll delay departure for a time. I'm beaming back down to the planet. ,KIRK
I'll have you checkmated your next move. ,SPOCK
I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe. Its mission was essentially peaceful. ,KIRK
What other one? ,KIRK
"No, that's not the way to handle it. Here, like this. Here, take his little head like that. There, arm in a. That's it. See how easy?",MCCOY
"Now wait a minute. He lost his ship and his crew, and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people. ",MCCOY
"It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't believe in you, either. ",MCCOY
Are they really? ,SPOCK
What is it you want? ,KIRK
"Yes. I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation. A source of water would stretch our survival. Did you see any evidence of rainfall? ",KIRK
"But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end. ",KIRK
"Welcome home, Captain. ",SPOCK
Eleven point six three zero. ,SPOCK
And how much time did you say we have to investigate? ,KIRK
"You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions. ",SPOCK
"We need you, your experience, your judgment. Matt! (Decker turns off the intercom) ",KIRK
Good. Mister Chekov. ,KIRK
The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.,SPOCK
Right? ,KIRK
How bad? ,KIRK
"If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations. ",KIRK
Sabotage! How? When? ,KIRK
"An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are?",KIRK
Go on. ,KIRK
About two thousand metric tons.,SPOCK
What is it? ,SPOCK
Companion. (It leaves Cochrane) We wish to talk to you. ,KIRK
(taking his weapon) I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition. ,SPOCK
"Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus? ",KIRK
"Indeed, Captain. That is unquestionably part of what I am doing. ",SPOCK
Was he trying to kill himself?,KIRK
"Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately. Without advance communication. Repeat, without advance communication. Have you got that, Spock? ",KIRK
"It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say? ",MCCOY
"Repeat. Federation orders to detain you for  SULU: They're veering off, sir. ",KIRK
"That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor._ M'BENGA: Please, release her. ",SPOCK
"Scotty, we're suddenly off course. Check our manoeuvering controls. ",KIRK
"Turbo elevators inoperative. Jammed, Captain. ",SPOCK
"All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down here. Kirk out. ",KIRK
Our ghost has materialised. ,SPOCK
"Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves. Neither side felt could pull out. ",KIRK
"A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship. Before that, someone tried to poison one of my crewmen. ",KIRK
"She likes you, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those orders? ",SPOCK
"Captain, the flower is not the only thing on board that is growing younger. ",SPOCK
You're welcome. ,SPOCK
"We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress. We had hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees. It is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case. And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions. I'll try not to upset you. You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk? ",KIRK
"Really, Captain, my modesty  KIRK: Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock. I suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time. ",SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon the performance of a single crewman, and the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally  MARLA: Not personally, Captain. Professionally. My profession is historian, and when I find a specimen from the past alive, I'm in the sheer delight of examining his mind. ",KIRK
Mister Spock?,KIRK
"Spock, is it possible the cloud consumes planets? ",KIRK
"Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark fourteen. ",SPOCK
"Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer. ",KIRK
Sensor readings. ,KIRK
"Medical report. (hands it over) She'll receive the best of care, Jim. She remembers nothing. She even thinks her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds.",MCCOY
"Jim, if we don't self-destruct now all those people will die. ",MCCOY
"Kirk to Enterprise. Come in, Scotty. ",KIRK
Standing by for instructions.,SPOCK
"And for humanity? You're still human  DEHNER: No, I  KIRK: At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me. ",KIRK
Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. ,SPOCK
Precisely. ,SPOCK
Secrets of the temple. ,KIRK
Lock on second target. ,KIRK
"No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a machine could do these things? ",KIRK
"If I guess wrong, Mister Spock is dead. Spock will die.",KIRK
"If you kill us, you'll still stay. ",KIRK
One life. ,MCCOY
I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for me. ,KIRK
We're not going to die. Now get off the bridge. ,KIRK
See if you can bypass him. ,KIRK
"A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection. Peace, harmony. ",SPOCK
Expand search radius. ,KIRK
Look at those pine trees. ,MCCOY
We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution.,MCCOY
"Captain, they are highly intelligent. I'm sure they are quite aware of the purpose of each piece of equipment now. ",SPOCK
The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us. ,SPOCK
"It just might, Captain. If he was, this would be the second time Lucifer was cast out, and thanks to you, the first time he was saved. ",SPOCK
"Let's go, Bones. You in good voice? ",KIRK
A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him. ,KIRK
"Mister Chekov, I mean Billy. Come along. ",KIRK
We know. The whole ship has apparently expanded. ,KIRK
"Arrives where? Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter? ",KIRK
"One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good  ADAMS: Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases. ",KIRK
Orbit condition. ,KIRK
We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history  SPOCK: History cannot be changed. ,KIRK
"You built this, Mister Cochrane? ",SPOCK
"Something wrong, Darnell? ",KIRK
It's an order. Give me the weapon. ,KIRK
"I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us. Captain to helmsman. ",KIRK
We used them in self-defence. You fired on us. ,KIRK
Captain Koloth. About that apology. ,KIRK
He played most illogically. His next move should have been the rook. ,SPOCK
"Well, I've got an idea about that. (goes over to the card table and gets guns pointed at him) Gentlemen. Gentlemen. This, card game is a kid's game. ",KIRK
Why did you not speak until now? ,KIRK
Phasers on stun. I want them conscious. ,KIRK
Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their original position. That intervening high ground. ,SPOCK
"I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea. ",SPOCK
What about the Phylosians? ,KIRK
"If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack.",KIRK
Activate phaser banks. ,KIRK
"Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well.",SPOCK
Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power. ,SPOCK
"His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home. ",SPOCK
"Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat. ",SPOCK
"Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not machines. ",MCCOY
It has to hold longer than a bit. ,KIRK
"What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago. ",SPOCK
"Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly. ",SPOCK
"From what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could not evolve here. ",SPOCK
"Professor. Professor! You've got to talk! You've got to tell them what happened. You've got to come out of it. Come on, Professor. Come on. Come on.",KIRK
"Three witches, what appears to be a castle and a black cat. ",MCCOY
"Phasers, fire. ",KIRK
What's your name? ,KIRK
Get him back to the Sickbay. Use security restraints. ,KIRK
You're here. There's nothing I can do about it. ,KIRK
"You do it, Spock. ",KIRK
How bad is it? ,KIRK
"True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter. ",SPOCK
Of course. I shall obey your restrictions. ,SPOCK

Yes. In my opinion. ,SPOCK

"Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume? ",KIRK
"I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel. Mister Vanderberg, we'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries and tunnels. ",KIRK

"Scotty, check the cargo hold. See if the drug is there. ",KIRK

I said we're not going anywhere. ,KIRK
That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it off. ,MCCOY

"Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. This is not a zoological expedition. Maintain a constant reading on the creature.

I believe I said that. ,SPOCK

How do you do it? ,KIRK
It could be a ship's log or a warning. It seems to keep repeating. ,KIRK
Unknown. ,SPOCK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"Yes, you're quite right, Mister Spock. Inefficient and illogical.",KIRK

"That's a great help, Mister Chekov. Bones? ",KIRK
The touch of death. ,SPOCK
Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up your gain?,SPOCK
What is this place? ,KIRK
You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination. ,MCCOY
"Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your foolishness.",KIRK
There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars. ,SPOCK
Ma'am. ,KIRK
You're as bad as Jim Kirk. He's been telling me to take these. ,MCCOY

"A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to a better way. With these bodies. ",SPOCK

"But this time, you were in Orion's past with us when the historians had the time vortex replay Vulcan history. You couldn't be in two places at once, so you died as a boy. Guardian! Did you hear that? ",KIRK
It is in this case. ,KIRK
"I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than  GARROVICK: Mister Spock, it's very kind of you to come here  SPOCK: Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe we have enough of that.

The Vedala are a powerful race. Why haven't your people retrieved the Soul? ,KIRK
Tricky stuff. Are you sure you want to risk  (The hypo is administered and Sulu opens his eyes.) ,KIRK
Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which. ,SPOCK
You take over my job and see what happens to you. ,MCCOY
Have you covered every possibility? Every factor? ,KIRK
"They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect us to act rashly. ",SPOCK
Negative.,SPOCK
Because I delayed in firing at it. ,KIRK

Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"Put the signal on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and pipe the entire exchange back to Starfleet Command. ",KIRK

"Nomad, you are imperfect! ",KIRK
You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and talk? ,KIRK
"Correct, Captain. ",SPOCK
Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments. Keep applying thrust against the pull. ,KIRK
You have twelve hours to consider your position. ,KIRK

Exactly what did I pass through? ,KIRK
"How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right  AYELBORNE: To wage war, Captain? To kill millions of innocent people?",KIRK

"In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet. ",SPOCK
"May I help you record his confession, Nurse? ",SPOCK
Ridiculous. No captain of the Starfleet would do that unless it was a matter of life and death. ,KIRK

I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question. ,SPOCK
"Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure tritanium. ",SPOCK

"But not his wisdom. He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul. You are a machine. ",KIRK
It's killing the captain!,SPOCK
"Your orders, Lieutenant. He wants to see your orders in the jacket. The Lieutenant's a little dazed. He captured several Zeons single-handed. One of the pigs struck him before he dropped. I promise you that pig will never get up again. ",KIRK

It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other. ,KIRK

Put them on the screen. ,KIRK
"So it would appear, Mister Sulu. All the same, keep that bag handy. ",KIRK
It's impossible. The twentieth century had no such  [Transporter room],KIRK

"Jim, that doesn't quite ring true.",MCCOY
I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs. Not even my second in command. ,KIRK
My prescription exactly. ,MCCOY
"I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's. ",SPOCK
"How are you, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Do you believe you're in communication with the creature? ,SPOCK
"Report, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
Worse. They're backed up into the corridor. ,MCCOY
"So, Lady Macbeth. Interesting. What's your next move? ",KIRK
Lock us onto your screen. ,KIRK
"Well, we can't do much underwater exploration without the aqua-shuttle. Our equipment is too limited. ",MCCOY
"And by coincidence, both you and Mrs. Crater requested salt tablets. ",KIRK
"Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated? ",KIRK
"A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots. ",SPOCK
"Full sensor probe, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety. ,SPOCK
And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise.,KIRK
She has five seconds to live. Reply. ,KIRK
"I'm afraid I don't know, Captain. Its illogical behaviour precludes a logical solution. ",SPOCK
"Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked. Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power. ",KIRK
"Don't lose your head, Bones. Nobody's staying anywhere. ",KIRK
Leave my crew alone. (Charlie leaves) ,KIRK
"Steady as she goes. Phaser crew, stand by. ",KIRK
"Affirmative, Captain. ",SPOCK
We found something. ,MCCOY
"If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes. ",SPOCK
"Seal off the area, Ensign. You know the law about transporting animals proven harmful. ",KIRK
She called this the world. These people don't know they're on a spaceship. ,MCCOY
Destroyed it? It was your only hope. ,KIRK
"Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock. ",KIRK
"Crude methods, but effective. ",SPOCK
Help me! Help! Help me! ,KIRK
Execute. ,KIRK
I could confine her to quarters. ,KIRK
"If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves. ",SPOCK
"He's staying, Scotty. Kirk out.",KIRK
"Yes, I do. What's he doing here? ",KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision. ",SPOCK
It was working before. Try it again. ,KIRK
No problem yet. Maintain alert. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment. ",KIRK
"Captain, they're using  (All over the ship, people fall to the floor)",SPOCK
Careful. ,KIRK
"Chekov, photon torpedoes. Fire! ",KIRK
Are you the new security officer? ,KIRK
How is it down there? ,KIRK
"There's no other way, Bones. We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed. ",KIRK
"Take the guards, have a look outside. Radioactive readings, chemical pollutions, any further sign of life. ",KIRK
You'll destroy him. ,MCCOY
"Yes, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Nonetheless, let's have it on the record. ",KIRK
"Because I kicked Chuft-Captain. Consider. Chuft-Captain has been attacked by an herbivorous pacifist, an eater of leaves and roots. One who traditionally does not fight. And the ultimate insult, I left him alive. Chuft-Captain's honour is at stake. He must seek personal revenge before he can call for help. ",SPOCK
"You worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine. Get to work. ",KIRK
Report. ,KIRK
Jim.. Spock. No pain. ,MCCOY
"Mister Chekov, as you were. Chekov! ",KIRK
"Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy. ",KIRK
"Traces of argon, neon, krypton, all in acceptable quantities.",MCCOY
"Medical department report, Doctor. ",KIRK
"On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient! ",SPOCK
What girl? ,MCCOY
Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he? ,KIRK
"No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem. ",KIRK
Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual device. ,SPOCK
One of Mudd's love crystals. ,KIRK
He's got a good chance. ,MCCOY
It takes a while for its effects to be noticed. ,KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
What caused that? ,KIRK
"Please. Do not fight us like this, Doctor Jones. I appeal to you as a colleague. Do not oppose us. ",MCCOY
I want you to go on shore leave. Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble. ,KIRK
Energise. ,KIRK
"It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational stresses. ",SPOCK
Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties. The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid to you. ,KIRK
"Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers.",SPOCK
It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody. ,SPOCK
It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red Alert. ,SPOCK
"Correct, Captain. And a rain forest this close to a desert is also illogical. It is my theory that what we have seen since we landed was manufactured, not created. ",SPOCK
Steadying on course marked in red. ,KIRK
Or whatever it is that's killing the crewmen. Perhaps I can help. Fill me in.,MCCOY
"I have none, Captain. Insufficient data. ",SPOCK
"Yes. I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here. The virus still exists. Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil. ",MCCOY
"Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship, and neither one of us will change. ",KIRK
"We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick. ",SPOCK
Whose history? ,KIRK
"Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin. ",MCCOY
We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body. ,KIRK
Temperature one hundred fifteen degrees. ,SPOCK
"Scotty, you've just given the Enterprise and Mantilles a chance to live. ",KIRK
"They did, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Mister Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging one hundred kilometres off your station. ",KIRK
"Captain, over there. ",MCCOY
Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard. ,SPOCK
Proceed immediately to maximum orbit. ,KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"Well, I must admit the sensor readings seem too good. Human readings, yes, but not a single physical flaw. Totally perfect body. ",MCCOY
Maintain orbit. Open the channel to Starfleet Command.,KIRK
Check out the life-support systems. ,SPOCK
"Spock, Scotty, come with me.",KIRK
"Security, put them both in the brig. ",KIRK
"Scotty, where are we? ",KIRK
Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries. ,KIRK
"Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock, do you read me?",KIRK
Yet one of them accomplished it. ,KIRK
"Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early.",KIRK
She would not jeopardise other lives. ,SPOCK
"Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes. ",KIRK
Very well. Continue investigations. Kirk out.,KIRK
You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along? ,KIRK
To read minds? ,KIRK
On my way.,KIRK
"I can try, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow. ",SPOCK
"Good work, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know.,MCCOY
Let me see. It's just a thorn. I was hoping to make you forget about this today. ,KIRK
"This whole thing's incredible. A robot? A machine like that, who would build it? ",MCCOY
(standing) Spock? Where are we? ,MCCOY
"I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential. ",SPOCK
Mrs. Crater. I won't ask again. ,KIRK
Doctor McCoy. ,KIRK
We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are peaceful. ,KIRK
The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair. ,SPOCK
Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone. Hold our position. Play dead. ,KIRK
"What have you got there, Spock? ",KIRK
"Good work, Mister Scott. That deflector shield went up just in time.",KIRK
"The hypo, Captain. ",SPOCK
It's important. Please. ,KIRK
"According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful. ",SPOCK
"There's nothing I can do, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. ",SPOCK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
"Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register. ",SPOCK
Energise. Any incoming cargo?,KIRK
"I don't like the sound of him, Jim. ",MCCOY
"I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! (leaps up with cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat)",KIRK
The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked. ,SPOCK
"He is unharmed. I have taken his body to demonstrate  MCCOY: (drawing his phaser) I won't go along with this. Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are. ",KIRK
"Oh. Well, we could offer it salt without tricks. There's no reason for it to attack us. ",MCCOY
We have little choice. ,KIRK
"It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond. ",KIRK
Yeah. That's right. That's just what it is. ,MCCOY
"Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mister Sulu. Magnification. Still nothing, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
What? ,KIRK
"You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose KIRK: I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and that's the end of it. ",SPOCK
Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports? ,KIRK
"Jim, my concoction actually worked. The fever's broken. And what recuperative powers. The infection's begun to drain already. ",MCCOY
"The Venus drugs, Harry. ",KIRK
"What do you mean, beings like yourselves? ",KIRK
"There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Evidently, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Position report, please, Mister Chekov. ",SPOCK
And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible. ,KIRK
"Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least for the present. I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six. ",KIRK
McCoy to Kirk. ,MCCOY
Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight? ,KIRK
Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More likely a loose association of some sort. ,SPOCK
"I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain.",SPOCK
"They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but  KIRK: Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war. Kirk to Bridge. ",MCCOY
"Bones Spock, come here. ",KIRK
"In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now? ",KIRK
"Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
She's becoming a woman.,SPOCK
Open the vent. On my way to the bridge. Kirk out. Ensign Garrovick. ,KIRK
"Jim, I want you to hear this. ",MCCOY
"Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.",MCCOY
Where is Spock? ,KIRK
"Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?",KIRK
Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about this enemy. ,KIRK
"No, there's more to it than that.",KIRK
"Agreed, Doctor. ",KIRK
"That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it._ KIRK: Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months. ",MCCOY
Who is conducting the research? ,SPOCK
Standing by. ,SPOCK
Yes. ,KIRK
Thank Mister Spock too. And Captain Kirk. ,MCCOY
"Hold on, Spock. Out of the mouths of babes  BOY: Who you callin' a babe? ",KIRK
Thank you. Kirk to Bridge. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet command. Tell them we have a prisoner. ",KIRK
"Shall we tell them how they can reverse the effects of the field, Jim? ",MCCOY
"We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy. ",KIRK
Very impressive. ,KIRK
"Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad state. ",MCCOY
"Oh, yes. Let me know what you come up with. I'll be in the Sickbay. ",KIRK
"Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile. ",SPOCK
Here. Let me try it. ,KIRK
"If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what we've done. If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them. Does everybody remember what to do? ",KIRK
Indeed? Why did you marry her? ,SPOCK
It tastes like an ancient herb derivative. ,MCCOY
"Yes, Spock? ",KIRK
"I wouldn't worry, Doctor. Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout the ship. ",KIRK
"Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock . ",KIRK
"Scotty, take them to the briefing room. ",KIRK
Eve? ,KIRK
Not large enough even for a lifeboat. ,SPOCK
"This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence number two, code one, one A, two B. ",SPOCK
You knew Rizzo? ,KIRK
Perhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve. ,SPOCK
"But only a machine, Mister Spock. The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Take care of him, Doctor. ",KIRK
"Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me. ",KIRK
"If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers  CLAUDIUS: you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire, and violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies. I believe you all swear you'll die before you'd violate that directive. Am I right? ",KIRK
"Brooding, Captain? ",SPOCK
Mister Scott? ,SPOCK
"Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please. ",SPOCK
"Compton, did they accelerate you? ",KIRK
"Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"I don't know what's going on, but the first officer of this ship will be treated with respect. ",KIRK
"Amen to that, Scotty.",MCCOY
Back into your body. We brought it along with us. ,KIRK
I'll find it. ,KIRK
"Physically human but not human. These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android. ",MCCOY
"The problem is, it could be anything Some spores or pollen in the air, some chemical. Just finding it could take months, maybe even years. And I've only got one lead. The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s. Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that. ",MCCOY
"My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones. ",KIRK
Is there nothing you can do? ,KIRK
"Whoever you are, you've proven your skill at creating illusion.",KIRK
"We aren't going to go, to be certain?",SPOCK
"Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship because we desire it. ",KIRK
"If that structure is the source of his power, I want to know where he is when we attack it. ",KIRK
"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point two five  [Bridge]",SPOCK
"After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your hand? ",KIRK
"Jim, the door. ",MCCOY
Yes. Those are the orders. ,KIRK
"Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Care to debate that, Spock?",MCCOY
"Sickbay reports five minor injuries, all being treated. ",MCCOY
I don't know how to get inside the temple. ,KIRK
"You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this? ",MCCOY
What about sensor failure? ,KIRK
Then you know that nothing can be done. ,KIRK
"Spock, take care of McCoy. ",KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
By giving you a new teacher. ,KIRK
That unit is a woman. ,SPOCK
Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am substantial. You are not imagining this. ,SPOCK
"But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost. Why that example? ",KIRK
"Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive. ",MCCOY
"I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity? ",SPOCK
"Spock, did Selek look like you do now? ",KIRK
"Incredible as it may seem, these people have no idea they're living on a spaceship. ",SPOCK
I don't intend to kill him. ,KIRK
"What does she mean, the last one? ",KIRK
Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made. ,SPOCK
"It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them. ",SPOCK
Not generally. But there have been exceptions. ,SPOCK
There is an insect life. ,KIRK
"You're on to something, Spock. What is it? ",KIRK
"Spock, you're alive! ",KIRK
"No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship. ",SPOCK
"But it did happen, Spock. ",MCCOY
"I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital. If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way. Clear, Spock? ",KIRK
"The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't want to come in here and use our muscle, you know what I mean? That ain't subtle. So what we do is we help one guy take over the planet. He pulls the strings, and then we pull his. (to Spock) Hey, you, sit down.",KIRK
"Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular course. ",SPOCK
No. I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little. ,KIRK
"Your automatic setting is laid in, Captain. ",SPOCK
It's possible. ,MCCOY
"No. We might be able to locate you, if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for. Is it medical? ",KIRK
What would be the point? You've already made up your minds.,KIRK
It would seem the assumption was premature. ,SPOCK
"That's all right. It's all right, Alexander. Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help. ",KIRK
"What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain.",SPOCK
Space terminology. We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light. I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are. ,KIRK
I do. ,MCCOY
"Those beautiful words, well acted, change nothing. ",KIRK
Will you take me there? ,KIRK
"Then the passengers, or builders, are dead. ",SPOCK
Melakon? ,KIRK
"We? Where's your wife, Professor? We're concerned about her. ",KIRK
Captain? ,SPOCK
"But if children are made totally dependent on their teachers, they will never be anything but children. ",KIRK
"If you could remember your exact words, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
Transfer to main viewer. ,SPOCK
"Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock, you come with me. Scotty, you too. ",KIRK
"Thank you, Yeoman. That's sufficient.",KIRK
"We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation. ",SPOCK
"Very good, Scotty. Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"So, I've been relieved. ",KIRK
"Try and beam that pilot aboard. Take over, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit, and I can completely cure this. (his arm)",KIRK
"I'll take over, Mister Spock. You report to Sickbay with Doctor McCoy. ",KIRK
The last of her kind? ,KIRK
"The wound is completely healed. It fits, Jim. She must be an empath. Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions. They become part of her. ",MCCOY
What is it? ,KIRK
"No, no, no. Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them? ",KIRK
"The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails.",KIRK
"I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same instant as Doctor McCoy. ",SPOCK
I've joined you. I understand now. ,KIRK
"Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to blast it out of space. ",KIRK
Erased?,MCCOY
"No, Charlie. ",KIRK
"20th century Earth. 'All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer by'. You could feel the wind at your back in those days. The sounds of the sea beneath you. And even if you take away the wind and the water, it's still the same. The ship is yours. You can feel her.",KIRK
Spock to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
How do you know? ,KIRK
Sir? ,SPOCK
Can you tell me what happened?,KIRK
"Turn the other heads this way! Bones, the serpent heads! Turn them to face the pyramid! I'm coming down. ",KIRK
You are all of those things and many more. They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them.,MCCOY
"You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours. ",SPOCK
"Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?",KIRK
"Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle stations. I hope we won't need your services, Bones. ",KIRK
They seem completely secure and unafraid. ,MCCOY
And Spock is her rival. Is that any better? Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy. ,KIRK
Prepare to beam us up. ,KIRK
Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities? ,KIRK
And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness. ,SPOCK
Where is everyone? ,KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures. ,KIRK
Spock? ,KIRK
I'll be right there.,KIRK
"No, nothing. ",SPOCK
But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. ,SPOCK
Doctor.,KIRK
"Now, now, Demos. You're hardly in a position to take on an entire crew. ",KIRK
"Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty. ",KIRK
"Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress. Now we all know that. ",MCCOY
Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out. ,KIRK
It was set for cordrazine. ,KIRK
Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this. ,KIRK
"Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life.",MCCOY
"He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend! ",SPOCK
Scotty! ,KIRK
Great. I hope we last long enough to be beamed up. Phasers ready.,KIRK
I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have no appetite for green blood. ,MCCOY
"Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career. ",SPOCK
Unusual that such a lake would exist under these planetary conditions. ,SPOCK
Good old Virgil. We can always count on him. ,KIRK
"Now that we're here, what do we do? ",MCCOY
"No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming tapes have been altered. ",KIRK
I remember the words. I wrote them down. You said them like you knew them. You hardly glanced at the paper. ,KIRK
Certainly. ,KIRK
"An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful.",SPOCK
"There is no library, Captain, at least not that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff. ",SPOCK
We couldn't use it. We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there  KIRK: That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power. ,MCCOY
"Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell. ",SPOCK
"The Empire shall be overthrown, of course. ",SPOCK
Doesn't sound like the man I know.,KIRK
"Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Shut down all unnecessary systems. Get every ounce of impulse power. We've got to get away from this planet. ",KIRK
Have you located the malfunction? ,KIRK
"Oh, you've heard about that, have you? ",KIRK
"Yeah, a little bit, I guess. You see, we walked out of each other's lives ten years ago. She married Crater, and for all I know she may have forgotten me completely. Of all the bonehead ideas, Jim, how'd I let myself in for things like this? ",MCCOY
"Keep your phasers locked on target, Mister Sulu. Hold your fire until they fire first. ",KIRK
"Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder.",KIRK
Exactly? ,KIRK
We have to get out of here within three hours. Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the mission. ,KIRK
My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here. ,KIRK
"No, I don't think so. I think I ought to stay clear. ",MCCOY
"All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now. Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies. Something that thrives on fear, terror, death. Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong way. Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive. That she did sense something, something evil. ",KIRK
"Acute observation, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I also request McCoy accompany me. ,SPOCK
"Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know. ",MCCOY
"This colony is isolated, exposed, out on the edge of now here. He probably wants additional advice.",KIRK
He saw me off on this mission. ,KIRK
"Or anything else. Keep those deflectors up, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place. ",SPOCK
"Bones, what's troubling you with the girl? ",KIRK
"Yes, for instance, above it's cold and harsh. And below, it's warm. The air is fresh. ",MCCOY
"Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings? ",KIRK
"Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get through. ",SPOCK
"Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain? ",SPOCK
We wish only to save the life of the captain. ,SPOCK
Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing? ,KIRK
"Perhaps, Mister Boma. ",SPOCK
"I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane. ",KIRK
Sickbay? Doctor McCoy? ,KIRK
Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay? ,KIRK
"But we still have some doubts up here, Captain. Can you tell us any more?",MCCOY
Once. I didn't have time to look around. ,KIRK
"All right. We must take care not to be seen. Hey, Bem. Bem, come back! Scotty, Sulu, stay here with the monitoring devices. Come on, Spock. ",KIRK
"Change course. Come about to one eight five, mark three. ",KIRK
"Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand. ",MCCOY
Then get moving. ,KIRK
"But I've got one. Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim. In this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of three million Earth-type planets. And in all of the universe, three million million galaxies like this. And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of each of us. Don't destroy the one named Kirk. ",MCCOY
It attacked you? ,MCCOY
"Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.",SPOCK
"You'd know if you had compassion. A woman should have compassion, but I forget you're not a woman. ",KIRK
"Go ahead, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
It's a very interesting proposition. Let me think it over. ,KIRK
With a very long memory. ,KIRK
"(waking up) Yes, Spock? What is it? ",MCCOY
Good. ,KIRK
That's true. Fear would naturally be her first reaction. Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him. ,MCCOY
"Vessel changing course, heading toward us at high warp speed. ",SPOCK
"We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Simple humanoid, Captain. ",MCCOY
Can you prove you went directly home? ,KIRK
Daran Five? Inhabited? ,KIRK
"Well, if he asked you to forget him, I think you should try to do just that. Do you think he'd want to deceive you? ",MCCOY
"That's why our weight remains the same, same number of atoms.",MCCOY
What have you done? ,KIRK
Are you quite through shaking the ship around? ,MCCOY
"Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks? ",KIRK
"Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako? ",SPOCK
"Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave.",MCCOY
That's it. Let's go. ,KIRK
Something? You mean someone. ,KIRK
Your chances of survival are not promising.,SPOCK
Spock here.,SPOCK
"Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger. ",SPOCK
Did they hurt you? ,KIRK
"Must I make an example of you, too, Helm? ",SPOCK
"Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky.",KIRK
What's on your mind? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. Notify all hands to return to stations. All right, let's take her out. Warp factor two. ",KIRK
Check co-ordinates. Is it the same area? ,KIRK
Are you sure you're all right? ,KIRK
"Yes, Spock. And hatred. ",MCCOY
Cease fire. ,KIRK
Take care of Scotty. ,KIRK
"Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant. ",MCCOY
Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your woman away from you. You're jealous! You tried to kill me with your bare hands. Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting with the emotions of a human. You are a human. ,KIRK
"Professor Starnes? (the man has a phaser, and looks terrified.)",KIRK
"We're reading it, Lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel. ",KIRK
"Martha, you tell him. ",KIRK
"No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Put him on the speaker. Kirk here. ,KIRK
Spock? Spock! ,KIRK
"Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this. ",KIRK
"Spock, save your power for the shields. ",KIRK
Gone. ,KIRK
"Yes, very interesting. I might even say fascinating, but back to your mission. Doctor, do you feel any way may be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships? It would certainly solve many of our navigational problems. ",KIRK
"Jan, Jan. ",KIRK
"Korob and Sylvia as they really are. Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else. Only the power pack gave them reality. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov. If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing? ",KIRK
Unquestionably. Most impressive. ,SPOCK
Bones? You could stop all this by saying no. That's why I called you all here together. We'll all be deeply involved. It must be unanimous. ,KIRK
Mister Singh. Come here a moment. This unit will see to your needs. ,KIRK
I won't hurt you. Do you understand? I won't hurt you. ,KIRK
What is that supposed to mean? ,MCCOY
"Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together.",KIRK
Only a very slight chance it would work. ,SPOCK
Jim! ,SPOCK
Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the Prime Directive.,KIRK
"No. Over something as simple as this? No, it'll cure itself eventually, but. Do you know, uh I don't even remember how this happened. Do you hear that? ",KIRK
Stabbed over and over again. ,KIRK
I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here. ,SPOCK
Another plant? ,KIRK
Buildings? ,KIRK
It is time. ,SPOCK
Lock in for another blast. ,KIRK
Ingenious. ,SPOCK
"He's immensely strong. Already he has withstood attacks from me that would have killed a human being. Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile. The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine. ",KIRK
That won't be long enough. ,MCCOY
I'll buy speculation.,KIRK
To exercise the better part of valour. ,KIRK
And what will become of Doctor Lester? ,SPOCK
That we have yet to ascertain. ,SPOCK
"Very clear, Captain.",SPOCK
Can you fix it again? ,KIRK
Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock?,KIRK
You can't be serious. That thing is virtually made out of stone!,MCCOY
"Who is this, the Metron?",KIRK
"And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising. ,SPOCK
"Listen. Now, what do you think that  KIRK: Quiet. ",MCCOY
"Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know.",MCCOY
"I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help. ",KIRK
"That is always my intention, Captain. ",SPOCK
Nothing except perhaps an explanation. ,KIRK
"Has the target changed location, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, take command. ",KIRK
"Jim, you should see the research facilities. They've got a lab down there that. Well, I could spend the rest of my life studying it. ",MCCOY
"Mister Spock, I want you to run a survey, a complete survey of the planet using all ship's available instruments. ",KIRK
The fact one of my ancestors married a human female  KIRK: Terrible having bad blood like that. ,SPOCK
"What do you make of the cat, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"No, Captain. The historical records of this solar system are spotty, at best, going back nineteen years. Mostly they're technical data, meteor showers, auroras, radiation reports. ",SPOCK
Do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to return Captain Christopher and the guard? ,KIRK
Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals.,SPOCK
"But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning. Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan. Can you tame a world? ",KIRK
"Sargon, would it harm you if I  SARGON: You may use your tricorder, Mister Spock. Your readings will show energy but no substance. Sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind. ",SPOCK
"Agreed. How much desert do we have to cross, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in constantly questioning me on things you've already made up your mind about?,SPOCK
She's a very good lawyer. ,KIRK
Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four? ,SPOCK
You've what? ,KIRK
"A valid assumption, I would say. ",SPOCK
"Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but the bodies as well. ",SPOCK
The same. You must release Doctor McCoy temporarily. He is needed to find an antidote. ,SPOCK
"No readings yet, Captain. Possibly a second probe. ",SPOCK
You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago. How are you just picking it up now? ,KIRK
I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the Ambassador. ,SPOCK
"Our sensors are in a state of chaos, Captain. They became unreliable when we entered the Triangle. ",SPOCK
They don't operate. Agmar! ,KIRK
But so will yours. ,KIRK
"Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely. Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage. ",KIRK
"Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. ",SPOCK
"Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before.",KIRK
"Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders? ",KIRK
"The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain.",SPOCK
"Try to break through it, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
"Take us out of orbit, Mister Sulu. Let's go home. ",KIRK
"The medical kit wouldn't be harmful. It would help her, one of their specimens. ",MCCOY
"Romulans, Captain. They were apparently lying in wait on the far side of that asteroid. ",SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
"Not this time, Spock. ",MCCOY
"Doctor McCoy, your report. ",KIRK
Any chance of a projection or a ledge? ,KIRK
It'll take more than logic to get us out of this. ,MCCOY
All the adults are dead. Only the children are left alive. ,KIRK
"Captain, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I don't dare. ,MCCOY
In which case you'd be guilty of murder. ,MCCOY
Bones. Bones. ,KIRK
"They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we delaying here? ",MCCOY
"No. You see, the crisis was upon us, and then passed so quickly, Captain, that we  KIRK: Good. Good. Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities to test those orders which you never heard. Ahead warp factor two, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
Good. We'll tackle him together. We already know the questions.,KIRK
"Well, it makes it hard to teach you  CHARLIE: I don't want to do that. ",KIRK
"Bones, I wonder if five thousand years ago  MCCOY: You have a theory? ",KIRK
You have all the symptoms of the bends. Nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain. Now how would one get the bends down here? ,MCCOY
"Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig. ",KIRK
"Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we will have  AYELBORNE: Oh, eventually you will have peace, but only after millions of people have died. It is true that in the future, you and the Klingons will become fast friends. You will work together. ",KIRK
"You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with. ",KIRK
Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise. ,KIRK
Captain. ,MCCOY
"I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health. ",SPOCK
"Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing. (another hit) Source, Spock. ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
A force field? ,KIRK
You've got him on complete life support. Was he dead? ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in all sensors to the ship's library computer console.",SPOCK
Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant Nored, you could've stopped him. Why didn't you fire? ",KIRK
The weightless state has become their natural condition. ,SPOCK
Neither do I. He's in perfect health. ,MCCOY
I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. It will be interesting to see if his brain matches his body. ,MCCOY
"Negative. Lock in on my communicator signal. Your Excellency, please do not interfere. I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons. ",SPOCK
Go on. ,KIRK
"Washburn, get down to Engineering. Assist Mister Scott. ",KIRK
I presume you are the planet's master computer. ,SPOCK
"Then we'd better become experts, and fast. ",MCCOY
"Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical. ",SPOCK
Coming.,KIRK
"Spock, play the last log tape. Maybe they had time to record what happened to them. ",KIRK
I think we're due for a pick-up. ,KIRK
Fire at minimum range. ,KIRK
Well? ,KIRK
"Contact Starfleet. Inform them the Federation mining rights on Capella have been secured by treaty, documents signed by the young high chief's regent. Report follows. ",KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Probably. Rank hath its privileges.,KIRK
"Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured. ",SPOCK
"At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor.",SPOCK
Any sign of Captain Koloth's ship? ,KIRK
"Scotty, activate tractor beam. Lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there. ",KIRK
Is this where I hit you? ,KIRK
"If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today I  MARLA: I know, sir. I'm sorry. ",KIRK
It does now. ,KIRK
I believe in you. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"I cannot, Captain. ",SPOCK
Is there any way Spock could get through to us? ,KIRK
There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to twenty years ago. ,KIRK
Just their uniforms left. ,KIRK
"Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a return course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot re-cross the barrier using sub light speed. ",SPOCK
What are you doing? ,MCCOY
"No. You won't be destroyed. You'll be without your Controller for the first time, but you'll be much better off, I think. ",KIRK
Spock to transporter room. ,SPOCK
"Well, so much for mythology. ",MCCOY
What do you want? ,KIRK
"Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night. ",SPOCK
Tie us in. ,KIRK
And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.,MCCOY
Commence transporting shore leave parties. Tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they've ever had. Kirk out.,KIRK
I don't understand how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain. ,MCCOY
But he was alone. Can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing?,KIRK
It means you're a very beautiful woman. ,KIRK
"None at all, sir. ",SPOCK
I find them strangely attractive. ,SPOCK
"Well, Mister Spock? (one figure is beamed back) Jim? ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant, when you were unconscious, you were speaking. ",KIRK
New course? ,KIRK
There's only one kind of woman. ,KIRK
"Very good. Thank you, Mister Scott. Kirk out.",KIRK
I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.,SPOCK
"Garrovick, get back to the ship. Tell them to prepare to detonate. ",KIRK
What about your animals? ,KIRK
Nor have I. ,SPOCK
Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions. ,SPOCK
The source of it? ,KIRK
You mean you brought us here? ,KIRK
Proceed. ,KIRK
"(brings over a magazine) Captain, I thought you might find this interesting. ",SPOCK
Mess call. ,KIRK
Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction. ,SPOCK
"Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it? ",KIRK
You're certain you recognise his voice? ,SPOCK
The inevitable outcome? ,KIRK
Mister Sulu. ,KIRK
Get ready. ,KIRK
"Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations  KIRK: How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate. Invasion.",SPOCK
"For once I agree with you, Doctor. The more informative specimens will come from the sea bottom. ",SPOCK
What has all this got to do with the Enterprise? ,KIRK
"I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister Spock. (to Elaan) I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected part of the ship. ",KIRK
You're an actor now. What were you twenty years ago? ,KIRK
They are both stubborn. ,KIRK
"Standing by, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"No, of course you didn't. ",KIRK
Lieutenant Uhura. ,SPOCK
"Being your slave, what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend, nor services to do, till you  MCCOY: Stop it! Don't do this to him, Parmen! ",KIRK
"We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help? ",KIRK
Then anything you develop here as a result of all this is useless. ,KIRK
"Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look. ",KIRK
Thank you.,KIRK
"He really doesn't seem the saboteur type, Jim. ",MCCOY
"How? Now you tell me how. All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water. Now you tell me, how it presents a danger to my ship? ",KIRK
What are you waiting for? Hurry! ,KIRK
Where? ,KIRK
The question is irrelevant. ,SPOCK
And what about us? Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface? ,KIRK
"Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this.",SPOCK
I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw. ,MCCOY
Try all frequencies. ,KIRK
Casualties? ,KIRK
"No, beloved. If we torment ourselves  MULHALL: Beloved. What will that word mean to a machine? ",KIRK
"But a fascinating one, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Careless of me, Mister Spock. Planetary life forms? ",KIRK
"I think I have an idea. So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here. ",KIRK
"Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically. ",SPOCK
We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova? ,KIRK
That is an outstandingly stupid idea. I'm sorry. The drug. I simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature. If they have one. ,SPOCK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Is there a structure of some sort near you? ,SPOCK
I should have never reconnected his mouth. ,MCCOY
"If we do, Captain, we may also encounter forces and phenomena beyond our understanding. ",SPOCK
I'd say no. ,MCCOY
"Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong erratic electrical impulses. ",SPOCK
"Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one. ",MCCOY
"Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack becomes even more imperative. ",SPOCK
"I'm not interested in eating, Bones. ",KIRK
"Trelane! Everyone, we're getting out of here. Now. This is the Captain. Commence beaming up. Maximum speed. ",KIRK
Then why are you here? ,KIRK
"Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of  CHRISTOPHER: A boy. I'm going to have a son. ",KIRK
Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible range of examinations and tests. ,KIRK
To say the least. ,KIRK
"Nothing, Captain. No contacts, no objects in any direction.",SPOCK
"Continue alert, decks four through eleven.",KIRK
"Think it over, Mister Cochrane. There's a whole galaxy out there waiting to honour you. ",KIRK
How do you know our names? ,KIRK
And this cave a trap. ,KIRK
"All right, Doctor, you built this thing. How do you propose to turn it off? ",KIRK
"Maybe they're waiting for the mist to clear. (it clears) Well, how about that. Great granddaddy's weed spray still works. ",MCCOY
"No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time. ",KIRK
"Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running around. He should be in bed. ",MCCOY
But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a perfect thing as you? ,KIRK
"I find that most unusual, Captain. ",SPOCK
"(over Chekov's speech) Lieutenant Uhura, all decks (rest of speech lost under Chekov's increasing volume) ",KIRK
"An illogical question, Doctor, since obviously you are hearing my voice. ",SPOCK
I told you to lift off! ,SPOCK
"It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not? ",SPOCK
We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there. ,KIRK
Can't breathe. Suffocating. Help. Can't breathe. ,KIRK
A lot of it? ,KIRK
"Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now. ",SPOCK
"Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault. ",SPOCK
And you'd prefer to keep him here until I complete my investigation anyway.,KIRK
"You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?",KIRK
"t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)",SPOCK
That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home is a planet millions of light years away. ,SPOCK
How close are you going to it? ,MCCOY
Interesting. ,SPOCK
You said I was in perfect condition. ,KIRK
"Professor Gill, can you hear me? You've got to speak. You've got to speak. This is our last chance. Gill?",KIRK
"Any problems, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Scotty, lock in on our position. ",KIRK
"He never even had a chance to fire, Captain. ",SPOCK
For hitting you. I'm sorry. ,KIRK
I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and neither are you. ,MCCOY
"What is it, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
Take a close look at me. ,KIRK
"Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being misled. ",KIRK
That would seem logical. ,SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two. ",KIRK
"Spock, what did you perceive? ",KIRK
Engineering? ,KIRK
What the devil is that? ,MCCOY
Scotty.,KIRK
"You keep the dilithium shipment, no mention of the whole incident to Starfleet or in my log, plus and additional galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the drug. ",KIRK
"Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion. ",SPOCK
Captain. ,SPOCK
He's hardly breathing. Help me get him to Sickbay. ,MCCOY
"No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're  [Ice Age]",KIRK
"Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell. Hold this position. ",KIRK
"The Enterprise is waiting, Mister Cochrane. ",KIRK
What's the matter? Why can't he get through? ,KIRK
You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you. ,KIRK
We may simply render it powerless. ,SPOCK
"Spock, you tell them. ",KIRK
"It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location. ",SPOCK
"An exact duplicate of the Enterprise? Is it in orbit, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
Then what is it? ,KIRK
"This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire culture based on this. ",SPOCK
"Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism. ",SPOCK
This will not take long. ,SPOCK
"Harmless, maybe. Little? (pushes a beach ball off his seat) In any case, they're eating the quintrotriticale. ",KIRK
His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared. ,SPOCK
"Your campaign, Mister President.",KIRK
Perhaps it understands another kind of language. Condition Red Alert. Prepare for phaser firing. ,KIRK
"Uhura, why did you tell her? ",KIRK
"This is the United Spaceship Enterprise. I'm Captain Kirk, commanding. ",KIRK
Five in all. ,SPOCK
"This is the First Officer speaking. Security, send an armed team to the Bridge. Transporter Room, stand by to beam Captain Kirk aboard.",SPOCK
"I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before. ",SPOCK
Spock. Where's Spock? ,KIRK
"Beam us aboard, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered. ",MCCOY
"Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared.",MCCOY
Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate Earth woman.,SPOCK
"I don't like it, Jim. Why only one short signal and no more? ",MCCOY
"Come on, Jim. Let's go. ",MCCOY
Jim! Spock! Jim! Spock! ,MCCOY
But you probed our memory banks.,KIRK
"Spock! It must be this space. It's getting to me too. I know it's nothing you've done, Spock. I, I'm sorry. ",MCCOY
"Where did you get it, Mister Sulu?",KIRK
"If you have any doubt, that was indeed Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise. ",MCCOY
"Go ahead, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Now, Cloud William. ",KIRK
"Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement. Can I stand the strain?  ",KIRK
Our good doctor's been putting you on again. ,KIRK
"Commander Bem, this is not a joyride, a pleasure excursion. I cannot let you beam down to the planet without adequate protection. I'm sure you understand the diplomatic consequences if anything were to happen to you while you are under my protection. ",KIRK
"Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical selections. ",SPOCK
"Emergency manual monitor, this is the captain. Report. ",KIRK
"Any time you can bluff me, Doctor.",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
All right. Reprimand received. Go ahead. ,KIRK
"Not about tribbles, anyway. I am concerned about that new Klingon weapon. ",KIRK
"If I can be of assistance, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Spock, how do you read that? ",KIRK
"Leave medicine to medical men, Captain. You found no fountain of youth here. People live longer here now because it's natural for them to. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
We need them. ,KIRK
What about recent history? ,KIRK
"And in the storage compartments. (goes to a table monitor) This is Kirk. Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris. Have them meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. Come on, Spock.",KIRK
Scotty! ,KIRK
"Let it go, Jim. He's dead. ",MCCOY
"Not so fast, Spock. Lie there quietly. ",MCCOY
"On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was indeed fortunate. ",SPOCK
"Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that  KRYTON: Permission to speak was not given. ",SPOCK
I see.,KIRK
I've noticed something else. ,KIRK
I think we should get a few things straight. ,KIRK
"Sensors, a meteorite? ",KIRK
"A wise move, Captain. From what I can gather, even the Enterprise is no match for their force field. ",SPOCK
You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay. ,SPOCK
"I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity. ",SPOCK
Enterprise acknowledging. Stand by. Security alert three.,KIRK
Absorbed? ,KIRK
"Quite correct, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Negative in the deck area, Captain. He may have gotten out.",SPOCK
"We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless. Spock.",KIRK
"For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky. ",KIRK
"Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen before and may never see again. We could learn more in one day  SPOCK: We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left. ",MCCOY
"Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And food. We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years. So that should last us  ODONA: Forever. All my life I've dreamed of being alone. ",KIRK
I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers. ,SPOCK
Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does. ,KIRK
Joy be with you. Peace and contentment. ,SPOCK
The readings would so indicate. ,SPOCK
Ready to give it a try? ,KIRK
"How long have we got now, Scotty? ",MCCOY
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"He knows, Doctor. He knows. ",SPOCK
Captain? ,SPOCK
You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it. ,SPOCK
"Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mister Scott. Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in Engineering? ",KIRK
"Is that Nancy, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"(with chair) I'm your Captain, Spock! Can't you tell? Shoot!",KIRK
I think you may also find you have a connection burning someplace. ,KIRK
"Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support. ",SPOCK
What do you call that stuff? Fire? ,KIRK
"I believe our regulations are quite clear, Doctor. An immediate identity check and medical examination are a standard requirement at this point. ",SPOCK
"I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"We can't risk it, not while they're moving. We may never be able to find them again. ",KIRK
"The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren wasteland. I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a place. ",SPOCK
Report. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Doctor. Captain? ",SPOCK
That's impossible. ,KIRK
"Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Spock, for bringing back the knowledge of the Fabrini. ",MCCOY
"Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they? ",MCCOY
"No, I'm not. ",MCCOY
Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories.,MCCOY
To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility. ,SPOCK
"And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object? ",KIRK
McCoy. Chief medical officer. ,MCCOY
Warp factor eight. ,KIRK
Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction. ,SPOCK
"Technically, no. Medically, yes. Between the stimulants and the pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes. ",MCCOY
"In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our present course.",SPOCK
"Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe. Work out a setting. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock. You know Doctor Leighton, don't you? Would you say he's given to fantasy? ",KIRK
"Spock, on board? ",KIRK
I've heard it was similar.,KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable. ",SPOCK
"Make that definite, Doctor. He's aboard.",KIRK
"Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong. ",SPOCK
But it is there. ,KIRK
"Spock here. Ready to leave orbit, Captain. ",SPOCK
Who are you? ,KIRK
"Nor do I, but luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Dead? ,MCCOY
Use the ship's sensors to locate them. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Getting something from the recorder now. ,SPOCK
There is no alternative. ,SPOCK
Because there are no feelings to discuss. ,MCCOY
That would seem to be in order. ,SPOCK
"It appears we have accidentally intercepted someone's transporter beam, Captain. ",SPOCK
Would any known disease organism do that? ,SPOCK
What kind of biology? ,KIRK
"Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is, we could extinguish ourselves. ",SPOCK
You mean you're giving up? ,MCCOY
"What are you doing here, Bones? ",KIRK
"Keep trying those controls, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius. As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats. ",KIRK
Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive. ,SPOCK
Good. ,KIRK
"The streamers are a combination of koinoenergy, almost an ambiplasma with an unusually powerful attraction force. ",SPOCK
Adam. ,KIRK
Hail the Fuhrer. ,KIRK
Not that much. ,KIRK
"Such a diversion would be of short duration, Captain. And I must point out, the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape. ",SPOCK
"Was the word totally random, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
I wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to Cestus Three.,MCCOY
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did. ,SPOCK
It's your human half I'm worried about. ,KIRK
And da Vinci? ,SPOCK
"Bridge to transporter room, prepare to energise. ",KIRK
Ask me no further questions. I will not answer. ,SPOCK
And since then two expeditions have failed to find him. ,KIRK
She might have killed someone. ,KIRK
Captain to Bridge. ,KIRK
Don't you ever relax? ,KIRK
"That's what I've recorded, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased with that? ",KIRK
Maximum acceleration when I give the word.,KIRK
"Then we must return the same way, through the two novas. ",KIRK
"Including, I would hope, some of that monotonous, old dispensing of the regular vitamin rations to the crew. ",SPOCK
"You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove ineffective against the captain. ",SPOCK
Do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves. ,KIRK
What about Landru? ,KIRK
Your Surak is a brave man. ,KIRK
Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive. ,KIRK
Power up. All instruments activated. All readings normal. All go. ,SPOCK
Go on. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known. ",MCCOY
"You could have a point, Bones. Those ships, the city. The Phylosians built a technology possibly greater than we animal species did. ",KIRK
All right. On my way. ,KIRK
"My big chance? For what, Doctor? ",SPOCK
Mister Spock and I refuse to participate. ,KIRK
You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation.,KIRK
I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner. ,SPOCK
"Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness. ",SPOCK
"I would say none, Captain. The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it. I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves. ",SPOCK
Only the young Aquans? ,KIRK
I think so. ,MCCOY
"What about those blobs, Bones? ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your administrative area. ",KIRK
I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified. ,SPOCK
Who are you? ,KIRK
All you wanted before was my understanding. ,KIRK
"She's not, Jim. No change in reading. She doesn't know. ",MCCOY
"Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland. ",KIRK
Whatever you say. What shall I do? ,KIRK
"Very well. All decks, security alert. ",KIRK
And we know you. ,KIRK
Spock out.,SPOCK
Probe will impact in seven point three seconds. ,SPOCK
Any pathological or unusual empathic responses? ,KIRK
We always encourage our officers to make friends with the natives. ,KIRK
"Put it on the screen, extreme magnification. ",KIRK
"Why, Gill? Why? ",KIRK
I do now. ,KIRK
"I believe so, Captain. There is a grid at the top of the brain core. It uses it to sense. We can escape the cloud through it. ",SPOCK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"As far as the rest of the crew's concerned, I'm still dead. ",KIRK
Jim. The Captain's neck is broken. ,MCCOY
"Not precisely, no. ",SPOCK
"Captain Kirk, I shall consider it. ",SPOCK
"Mister Boma, we're working against time. ",SPOCK
"Still no response, communications? ",KIRK
Daras. ,KIRK
"The spherical thing ahead of you, the matter you intend to consume, sense it closely. ",SPOCK
"Spock, could I ask for some figures? ",KIRK
"Ready, Captain. [OC] Listen to me. Listen to me. You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. ",SPOCK
"Are you all right, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Queen to king's level one.,SPOCK
"Take it easy, Mister Scott. I hate to think what that stuff's doing to your stomach lining. ",MCCOY
Like Sulu. ,SPOCK
Hodin. ,KIRK
Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends.,SPOCK
What happened to the Keeper? ,KIRK
"Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says. I just heard the sound of  KIRK: The sound of a machine gun bolt being pulled back. (there are two more guards behind them.)",SPOCK
This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.,KIRK
Phasers on stun. ,KIRK
There are no such things as witches! ,KIRK
"That's a nasty cut, Jim. Does it hurt? ",MCCOY
"The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
At least they have up to now. ,KIRK
I said dismissed. ,KIRK
Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence. ,SPOCK
"Ensign, listen to me. ",KIRK
"Priority One distress call, and it's just absolutely peaceful.",KIRK
Put him on. ,KIRK
"Bones. (McCoy sedates her) Aurelan, you're safe now. ",KIRK
"If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all. ",KIRK
"Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess. ",KIRK
"An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them. She's made no attempt to contact our minds. ",SPOCK
None. ,SPOCK
"No, sir. Ninety seven point eight three five megatons. ",SPOCK
"Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut. ",SPOCK
"The first Klingon to step aboard this ship will be the last Klingon. Full security alert, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Warp factor one, Mister Hanson. ",KIRK
"Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try. ",KIRK
"Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear. ",SPOCK
"Perhaps, but there are logical applications. The key question is, how long does it take them to recharge? They will probably attack us again as soon as they are back up to power. And they will probably begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating the same trick. They want Cyrano Jones very badly. ",SPOCK
"I'm sorry, Lord Garth. ",KIRK
"In the name of heaven, where are we? ",MCCOY
"Unidentified. It's extremely faint and diffused. Captain, I suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect. ",SPOCK
Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers. ,SPOCK
"If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, prepare a probe. Scotty, we'll need a magnetic bottle for the charge. How soon? ",KIRK
"You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself. Your mate for all time. ",SPOCK
Commander Bem seems to be a model prisoner. ,KIRK
"Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn. ",SPOCK
Not exactly. He might be in trouble. ,MCCOY
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"We're not interested in legend. He's a living being, and intelligent life form. That's all we have to know about him. We will not join in harming him. ",KIRK
"Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
"Well, yeah, I'm beginning to feel a little bit picked on, if that's what you mean. ",MCCOY
"He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd.",SPOCK
"Start making preparations, Mister Sandoval.",KIRK
T'Pau. ,SPOCK
What in the name of heaven is this? ,MCCOY
"Leave, all of you. ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, what is our present position? ",SPOCK
"So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army. ",KIRK
Doctor Adams? This is Captain Kirk. It appears we may have an inmate of yours aboard the ship.,KIRK
And you've brought our furry friends down on us. ,MCCOY
"Jim, we've got to do something. ",MCCOY
"It is logical that we must reproduce the conditions that brought us here. Two novas must occupy the same space in both universes in order to create a gateway for us to travel through. One star dying in our universe, and one being born here would recreate the correct conditions. ",SPOCK
Report. ,KIRK
"My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor Daystrom. ",KIRK
All hands to your stations. This is a general alert.,SPOCK
"Hold on that, Uhura. Tell them to stand by. ",KIRK
Energise. ,KIRK
"If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy. I do not want to command the Enterprise, but if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans. ",SPOCK
"Storm's course, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"Nurse, you should CHAPEL: Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how you feel. You hide it, but you do have feeling. Oh, how we must hurt you, torture you.",SPOCK
"When you all finish laughing, I'd appreciate an explanation. ",KIRK
"I'm especially honoured to meet you, Mister Winston. My daughter was going to school on Cerberus about ten years ago when the crop failure occurred. The entire population would've starved, Jim, if Winston here hadn't used his personal fortune to bring in enough food and goods to carry them through the crisis. ",MCCOY
"Captain, your condition. ",SPOCK
Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. ,KIRK
That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable. ,MCCOY
"Sulu, flank speed ahead. Our only chance is to try to get into orbit around that thing. ",KIRK
"You're fired. Four hundred people  MCCOY: Jim  KIRK: They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign. I had to follow orders, always orders. ",KIRK
From a machine? That I'd like to see. ,MCCOY
"Bones, how did you do it? ",KIRK
"Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you? ",SPOCK
"Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal. ",SPOCK
"A hundred serpents. Serpents for the Garden of Eden. We're very tired, Mister Spock. Beam us up home. ",KIRK
"Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well, Prefect, but there's only one way we can find out what it is Mister Scott cannot remember.",KIRK
"Life readings, Doctor McCoy? ",KIRK
And space travel is? ,KIRK
What is the position of the Klingon ship? ,KIRK
Finnegan. One thing FINNEGAN: Sure. Name it.,KIRK
"As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do. ",KIRK
You might be wise to start. ,SPOCK
"No, but if it's reality, what happened? ",KIRK
"But if he had a reason, could he have done it? ",KIRK
Lock into orbit. ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, I need proof. All you're telling me is that on the one hand he may be lying and on the other  (The cat exits the room.)_ SECURITY [OC]: Security alert. All decks alert. The prisoner has escaped. All decks alert. ",KIRK
Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down. ,MCCOY
"He came up from engineering, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop. ",SPOCK
"Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure. I'm sure you know that, Doctor. ",KIRK
"Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy. ",SPOCK
"Sorry, Em. We'll be needing you. Sord. ",KIRK
"And I too am pleased, beloved. ",KIRK
Tricorder?,KIRK
Get those men aboard fast. ,KIRK
Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero. ,MCCOY
Then where were you during the hour? ,KIRK
"Spock, Captain. ",SPOCK
"How could it be gone? What the devil does that mean, Jim? ",MCCOY
"Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library? ",MCCOY
Quickly! ,KIRK
Five to beam up.  ,KIRK
"I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving. ",SPOCK
"How is she, Doc? ",KIRK
"Jim, he's run off. ",MCCOY
"Ready, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all.",KIRK
Don't touch me. Stay away. Jim. Spock. Are you here? ,MCCOY
"Now, wait a minute. Not our attempt, Mister Spock. A group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type. Devoted to logic, completely unemotional  KIRK: All right, all right, gentlemen. As you were. Rig for tractor beam, Helm. Lock onto that vessel. ",MCCOY
"I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question. ",SPOCK
Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours. ,KIRK
Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip. Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift. We've got to stop them. We outnumber them. Their only hold on us is the paralysis field. ,KIRK
What's wrong? ,SPOCK
Did you get up into space? ,KIRK
Scotty. ,MCCOY
I think so. Looks like some kind of shock. ,MCCOY
Our thoughts will intertwine. ,KIRK
"I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula. ",KIRK
Explain. ,SPOCK
"All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you. ",KIRK
I was simply trying to avoid an argument. (takes the scalpel),MCCOY
Nor it ours. ,KIRK
"A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around me. See? (to Chapel) Take the hypo from him. And inject him with it. ",SPOCK
"I have never slumped in my life, Captain, but I was about to ask you the same  BRIEL [OC]: Security! Anyone, please! Mess Officer Briel requesting help in the Main Dining Room. Tables, chairs, silverware, everything seems to have enlarged. Women losing rings, hairpins. Some are near panic. ",SPOCK
"Heartbeat now thirty, dropping fast. It's a heart flutter. He's dying. ",MCCOY
"Van Gelder's still violently agitated, Captain.",MCCOY
"Yes, sir, the Enterprise. I'm the captain. (Kirk and Garth shake hands) Can I help? ",KIRK
No. ,SPOCK
Right off the scale. It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared. The entrance is here. ,KIRK
You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested? ,KIRK
Wait a minute. I don't quite follow you. ,MCCOY
"Doctor McCoy, I  MCCOY: I've waited a long time for this, and you're not going to cheat me. ",SPOCK
"But there is, Captain. Ourselves. And there may be other things guarding the Soul of Alar.",SPOCK
Spock! What in the world? ,MCCOY
"Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock. ",SPOCK
Jim? Jim. Who hit you? ,MCCOY
Entirely possible. ,SPOCK
"Thank you, sir. ",MCCOY
Secure from Red Alert.,KIRK
Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder. ,KIRK
"On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume  GARTH: Remove this animal! ",SPOCK
Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump. ,KIRK
"Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one.  ",SPOCK
They are not within the confines of this solar system. ,SPOCK
"After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive. ",KIRK
"I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now whatever it is that's out there  SPOCK: It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor. ",MCCOY
"Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Jim. What is it now? ",SPOCK
"Indeed, Captain? Interesting. ",SPOCK
"One? Jackson, where are Scott and Sulu?",KIRK
"Mister Walking Bear, how do you know who's aboard that ship? ",KIRK
Report. ,KIRK
"Stand by on alert status, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Fire. ,SPOCK
Nope. ,MCCOY
"The Terratins are making available all possible dilithium. The crystals are small, but I believe they will provide enough power until we can obtain larger pieces. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant, can you hear me? ",KIRK
"Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door. ",SPOCK
Are you prepared to beam over? ,SPOCK
"Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us. ",SPOCK
"Well, I don't know why I was worried. You can't kill a computer. ",MCCOY
Villi? ,KIRK
"The wands are accumulators, receptors to attract energy, motion, sound, light, heat, every kind of energy around them. ",SPOCK
"I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky. ",MCCOY
By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal.,SPOCK
"Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er  EVE: They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness. ",KIRK
"Analysis, quickly. ",KIRK
Undoubtedly. ,SPOCK
I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless. ,SPOCK
Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us.,KIRK
"Hard over, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the phasers. Nor was its disappearance the type that would have been affected if it were using its cloaking device. ",SPOCK
They threw me a few curves. No time to explain. ,KIRK
Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal. ,KIRK
"Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief engineer, Starfleet, retired. ",MCCOY

"Scotty, set the controls for deep space. Two ten, mark one. ",KIRK
"To James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise. ",MCCOY
Not soon enough. ,KIRK
That implies there are intelligent life forms on Argo. ,SPOCK
"A few seconds, Scotty. We have to give Spock that much. ",KIRK
"Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make such a decision only for myself. ",SPOCK
"Not these children, to this extent. It's incredible. ",KIRK
A man must also have the power. ,SPOCK
"Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1. ",SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? (he takes a walk around then) Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the bridge? ",KIRK
"I understand, Doctor. I'm sure the Captain would simply have said forget it, Bones. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning nothing. ",SPOCK
Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them? ,KIRK
Not too big for the Enterprise to handle if it has to. ,MCCOY
What became of them? ,KIRK
Fire. ,KIRK
Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a UFO. ,SPOCK
"This gentleman is not  ATOZ: You, sir. I think you'll find something interesting over here. ",KIRK
"I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same thing. ",MCCOY
Miles? Are you joking? ,MCCOY
Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality. ,KIRK
"My place is here. If you please, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Go ahead, Doctor. ",KIRK
We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now.,KIRK
"Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl. This is the only lead we've had. ",SPOCK
Stabbed. And there's no sign of the weapon. ,KIRK
"It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it. ",SPOCK
You established the methods and the goals. ,KIRK
Two spacemen marching to a drum. ,SPOCK
My ship is at stake. ,KIRK
Can we? ,KIRK
Isn't that enough for one lifetime? ,KIRK
"Bones, how much time? ",KIRK
"Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you. ",SPOCK
Who are the doctors? Who operates? ,MCCOY
Bridge. Captain to Bridge.,KIRK
"Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise.",SPOCK
I still think you're imagining things. ,MCCOY
"There is a vessel out there, Captain. ",SPOCK

"Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk? ",SPOCK

"Evasive action, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
Yes. We took a bite out of it. ,KIRK
Feeling better?,MCCOY

One other thing. I've cut your duty time in half. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant  MIRA: Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor.",SPOCK
He would die almost instantly. ,SPOCK
May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor? ,SPOCK

Any signs of life?,KIRK
"Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings. Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told. ",KIRK
Peace  MCCOY: You're not! ,KIRK
Bones. ,KIRK
"I'm trying, Captain. ",SPOCK
Remarkable. ,SPOCK
I choose to believe they are. ,KIRK
Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it. Comet is highly dangerous.,KIRK
"You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However  MCCOY: There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor, and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery. ",SPOCK
Explain. ,KIRK
Yes. ,SPOCK
Mister Sulu? ,KIRK
"Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius. ",MCCOY
"Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure. ",KIRK
No. But it is interesting. ,SPOCK
Recommendations? ,KIRK
Are you sure you're not imagining all this?,KIRK
We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance.,SPOCK
"If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it.",KIRK
"If something went wrong  CHRISTOPHER: Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him. ",MCCOY
Is everyone safe? ,KIRK
Kirk to engineering. ,KIRK
"We hope through our medical assistance programs. to develop and strengthen relations with star systems such as yours, Supreme Prefect.",KIRK
But it does look promising. ,SPOCK
But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees below zero. ,KIRK
I won't shoot Nancy. ,MCCOY
"We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies, as near as I can tell. ",MCCOY
Did he seem to be getting hysterical? ,MCCOY
"If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding. ",SPOCK
Where are my officers? ,KIRK
"Yes, I think it's very good. ",KIRK
"No, but what we're investigating is. Would you mind taking the stand, Mister Hengist? ",KIRK
"Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn. ",KIRK
"A lot of them are dead. A lot of them are alive, but they won't be for long. ",MCCOY
"This is the Captain. Damage control parties on all decks, check in. All departments tie in with the record computer. Report casualties and operational readiness to the First Officer. Kirk out. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Control. I want them alerted to the position of that black star that's in the area of Starbase 9. ",KIRK
"Put it on, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
Have repair crews been assigned? ,KIRK
"The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos. ",KIRK
"This cousin, what was his name? ",KIRK
"I'm trying to help you, Spock. ",KIRK
"Yes, especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes. Apparently, none of them survived. ",KIRK
Same report.,MCCOY
"Mister Spock, get a security team down here on the double. ",KIRK
We can remain silent. ,SPOCK
Ready to accelerate to warp six. ,KIRK
Kirk to crew. Is anyone aboard? ,KIRK
"Yes, I think (an image of tiny Enterprise and the giant planet killer comes on screen) What the devil's going on? ",KIRK
"I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation. ",KIRK
Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen. ,SPOCK
"What do you mean, who's he? You know Mister Spock. ",KIRK
But you did kill! ,KIRK
Out.,KIRK
"Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Whatever arguments you have between yourselves is your business. My business is running the ship. As long as I command, there will be order. ",KIRK
"Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search. ",SPOCK
You're a wise Captain. ,SPOCK
"Now. as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M planets,  CHEKOV: Yes, sir. ",KIRK
You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home? ,KIRK
"If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too. Our ship has need of us. We have tasks to perform. ",KIRK
"What is that, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Come. ,KIRK
"I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your theories, your quaint philosophies.",KIRK
That's a girl.,KIRK
And now it has control of the Enterprise and taking us out of the galaxy. But why? ,KIRK
"No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of three starships. Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital. ",KIRK
"I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I deny it. I was reading in the library when I heard her scream. My lord, the library? Do you remember where the library is, my lord? ",KIRK
You could be wrong. Don't throw away your life on a mistake. ,KIRK
Don't fire. First man that fires is dead. ,KIRK
That's enough. We know what was said. ,MCCOY
Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.,SPOCK
"As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At first we were not certain what it was.",SPOCK
I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked. ,SPOCK
But we're strangers to each other. ,MCCOY
"No problems here, sir. ",SPOCK
"Is that you, Doctor McCoy, and are you with the Captain? ",SPOCK
"There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out. ",SPOCK
"Beam us up, Scotty. ",KIRK
I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended. ,KIRK
Both these outposts and this vessel will be considered expendable. Captain out. ,KIRK
And the computer controls the ship. ,KIRK
"I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them? ",SPOCK
"Bones, can you save him? ",KIRK
The emergency is real. I need these things. ,MCCOY
I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder. ,SPOCK
It certainly can support life forms. But I cannot speculate on what type without further data. Mister Arex is conducting a sensor scan now. ,SPOCK
Freestyle? ,KIRK
"Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor. ",SPOCK
Sound alarm.,SPOCK
"Mallory! Marple, stand back! Watch it! The rocks! (kneeling by the body) Kaplan. Hendorff. I know Kaplan's family. Now Mallory. ",KIRK
"They won't hurt you, Charlie. (security arrive) They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them. ",KIRK
That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases. ,KIRK
I understand. ,SPOCK
Insults are effective only where emotion is present. ,SPOCK
We just want to talk to somebody about Spock's brain. That's all. ,MCCOY
That one's done. Tested out normal. ,MCCOY
"I can find no reason for the captain's behaviour, except possibly that we've been on patrol too long without relief and diversion. He has resisted all of my attempts to run a psychological profile on him. ",MCCOY
The renowned Tholian punctuality. ,SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die. ,MCCOY
Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here? ,MCCOY
"Yes, Spock. Yes. ",KIRK
"I have, Professor. Believe me, I have. Where is Mrs. Crater? I want to talk to her, too. ",KIRK
You say they make the firesticks themselves? How can you be sure?,KIRK
You can't just stop the fleet. What gives you the right? ,KIRK
"Later, Spock. ",KIRK
Unknown. ,SPOCK
I should never have let him go. ,KIRK
Recircuit power to engines. Maximum speed heading three seven mark zero one zero. ,SPOCK
"Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps a flow of energy and channels it through his body? ",KIRK
"No kill I. What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us? ",KIRK
"A second ship has appeared. (another one decloaks) Correction, there are now three. We are surrounded. ",SPOCK
Do we get out of here? ,KIRK
Keep trying. ,KIRK
"A Klingon warship. (after a few moments) Any change, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"We've run out of time, Bones. No, wait. (to Daras, with a rifle)",KIRK
"Damage report, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
Captain? ,SPOCK
"Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that? ",KIRK
How? ,KIRK
Thank you. (the pair are beamed off) ,KIRK
"Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We have no intention of staying as your guests. ",KIRK
And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.,KIRK
Where is everybody? ,KIRK
Alexander. ,KIRK
"Captain, attack force almost within phaser range. ",SPOCK
"He's right, Jim. Being a doctor has its drawbacks. I always wondered why I (coughs, so they turn him on his side) Thanks. ",MCCOY
"One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing very rapidly. ",SPOCK
"Explain, Spock. ",KIRK
Bad enough. ,SPOCK
"Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to call her Gem. ",MCCOY
That was not the total conversion beam setting. ,SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises. ",SPOCK
"According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi.",SPOCK
Who did? ,KIRK
"They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Meaningless at the moment, Bones, but it was sent twice. Odds against that occurring in a totally random transmission are too high to ignore. There may be some intelligence trying to contact us. Mister Spock, continue research on the word terratin. ",KIRK
We shoot together. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet security team? ",KIRK
Good. ,KIRK
Full strength? ,KIRK
"If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Doctor. ",KIRK
Apparently you have a few things to learn about us. Detain them in the crew lounge.,KIRK
"You killed two of my  NOMAD: Creator, your biological units are inefficient. ",KIRK
You're killing your own daughter. How can you do that? ,KIRK
Huh. And how's the research going? ,KIRK
"Extrasensory perception. Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP? ",KIRK
Then we can report back for other work? ,KIRK
"Yes, from inside each expedition. Remember Spock, you were the one who said there are no life forms here except ourselves. ",KIRK
"These Providers of yours, are they  GALT: Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs. ",KIRK
"And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?",KIRK
Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi Germany. ,SPOCK
"Alexander, are there other Platonians like you? ",KIRK
"Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me. ",KIRK
"I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity.",SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
Captain? ,SPOCK
"To steal? To take them from you? No, no, my children, you misunderstand. We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time. ",KIRK
Looking us over. We're dead as far as he knows. ,KIRK
"Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of it? ",SPOCK
Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately. ,KIRK
It's unbelievable. ,MCCOY
"Mister Spock, if you'd concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already. ",KIRK
Anything? ,KIRK
"He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth. No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk. ",MCCOY
Spock? ,KIRK
"There is a disease here, something that affected the Exeter landing party and us. ",KIRK
"Agreed. However, to this point, we have not seen anything more powerful than equipment Starfleet already has. ",SPOCK
"Taos Lightning straight bourbon. Try some. In small amounts, it was considered medicinal. ",MCCOY
"Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T.",SPOCK
"And strong personal feelings, he obeyed the Prime Directive. His temporary blackout of the city below resulted in no interference with the society and yet saved the lives of myself and the landing party. ",KIRK
"Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier? ",KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Try and stop him. It's better if I go with him. ,KIRK
And a table. ,MCCOY
You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.,SPOCK
Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact. ,KIRK
"All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates. Approximately thirty years for each day. I don't know what's causing it. A virus, a bacteria, or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out. ",MCCOY
"Captain, I (collapses) ",SPOCK
What about the Constellation's tapes? ,KIRK
What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the Body? ,KIRK
"I'll be most effective on the job in the time left, if you'll keep this to yourself.",MCCOY
"I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself. ",SPOCK
I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command.,SPOCK
"Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations. ",SPOCK
Put it on the speaker. ,KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
"If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet.",KIRK
"At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe? ",KIRK
"As you may recall from your histories, this conflict was fought,  [Engineering]",SPOCK
"Captain, are you quite all right? ",SPOCK
(helping her back into her seat) Upsy-daisy. ,MCCOY
"There, that should do it. Just let him rest now. (to Tomar) You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of hours. ",MCCOY
"We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were dead, and we  (Mira runs to see) ",MCCOY
"If you don't allow me to bring Doctor McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her. ",KIRK
"I'm all right. Scotty, what are you doing here? ",KIRK
"I don't think so, Charlie. ",KIRK
"You look tired, Miss Chapel. Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections. ",MCCOY
"Call battle stations, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate. ",SPOCK
Does that mean they all tried to build something like this? ,MCCOY
"It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more. ",SPOCK
"Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, lock in on us. Medical emergency. ",KIRK
"Spock, you may have been right. We've lost contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire solar system. Any update from Starfleet? ",KIRK
"Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two.",KIRK
"A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain. ",SPOCK
"What was it he said, pain and delight? ",KIRK
"My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need for departure is even more immediate. ",SPOCK
Yes.,KIRK
Who are you? Why did you bring us here? ,KIRK
"No, Lieutenant, the cloud has engulfed Alondra. Captain, the planet seems to be breaking up. Its mass is definitely growing smaller.",SPOCK
"Further than that, if I'm successful. ",KIRK
And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there  SPOCK: It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.,KIRK
Initiate. Warp factor two. ,SPOCK
We're not going anywhere. ,KIRK
I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job. Computer. ,SPOCK
"Outpost 2 was the first to go silent, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
Telepathy? ,SPOCK
So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice. ,KIRK
"Well, I'm sure he'd like to feel the same way about you, Anne, but that may be impossible. Five years, that's a long time. People change. ",MCCOY
Enough talk. Let's get on with it. ,KIRK
"This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race. ",SPOCK
"It strikes me very well. But you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane. Why not up the stakes? ",KIRK
"This is not Nancy. (hitting her repeatedly) If she were Nancy, could she take this? ",SPOCK
"It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint accuracy is required. If the transportee should materialise inside a solid object, a deck or wall. ",SPOCK
Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about  SPOCK: Yes. We must all control our thoughts. ,KIRK
"Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, you are supposed to be monitoring the alien vessel. Our first priority is to free the Enterprise and ourselves.",SPOCK
"Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past episode or experience they all have in common. ",SPOCK
"If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company. ",KIRK
"Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth. ",SPOCK
"Yes, that's right. We're from the valley. ",KIRK
"Standard orbit, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Now, you're going to help me look for my friends. ",KIRK
Some doctors have all the luck. ,KIRK
"Spock, no one thought about those pterodactyls, remember? There's more at work here than our imagination. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock._ SPOCK: (at the mine map) I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed. ",KIRK
"Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all. ",KIRK
"Three to beam up, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
I'd say these people killed each other. ,MCCOY
No comment. ,MCCOY
Really? ,SPOCK
"Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind. ",MCCOY
"For years, I've loved you. ",KIRK
I know them now. ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up. ",KIRK
Most peculiar. ,SPOCK
"Exactly, sir. It seems they were where we are some tens of thousands of centuries ago. Their centuries, not ours. ",SPOCK
There is a difference! Your trouble is in you. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. The others are mere outcroppings. They suggest the peaks of submerged mountains. ",SPOCK
"We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock  SPOCK: Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, there's only one Vulcan aboard that ship. He should be easy enough to locate. ",KIRK
There must be a reason. ,KIRK
I need your advice. ,SPOCK
I am not like you. ,SPOCK
"Yes, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
At least the captain and Spock are safe. ,MCCOY
"I think we've located Mister Spock. Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing? ",KIRK
"Captain, the Melkotian object. ",SPOCK
"Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known information. ",SPOCK
Do I have a choice? ,MCCOY
"Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither side can have. Bones. Bones, the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers. The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks. If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again. ",KIRK
I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate this time. ,SPOCK
"Why, that scoundrel. ",MCCOY
"Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was Garrovick. ",SPOCK
"You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify immediately. ",KIRK
"We aren't going to go, to be certain?",SPOCK
Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction. ,KIRK
"We can't, Captain. Transporter is out again. ",SPOCK
"I'm curious, Doctor. Why is it called M-5 and not M-1? ",KIRK
"There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams. Now, I can't trace it down in my biocomps. Spock won't tell me what it is. But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him. ",MCCOY
I'll change first then. Captain out.,KIRK
You did say thirty minutes? ,KIRK
"Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me? ",KIRK
"Fascinating. It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature. ",SPOCK
"He's dead, Jim.",MCCOY
I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition. ,SPOCK
Indeed. ,SPOCK
"Are you responsible for bringing us here? Don't be afraid. Bones, what's wrong with her? ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command. ",MCCOY
I must take the ship.,SPOCK
Kirk to transporter room. ,KIRK
"Put it on the screen, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Ahead warp factor one, Mister Sulu.  ",KIRK
We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship.,KIRK
"How much longer, McCoy? ",KIRK
Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history. ,SPOCK
"When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation. (waves away a buzz) But there is an insect life. ",KIRK
"I don't agree with you at all, Mister Spock.",MCCOY
It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported.,KIRK
Scotty. Sorry to keep you waiting. ,KIRK
You now have ten minutes and ten seconds. ,SPOCK
"It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception  KIRK: Right down your alley, Spock. Get it here and get to work. That thing is still out there. Better go that way. ",SPOCK
"He's dead, Jim.",MCCOY
What would you like to know? ,KIRK
"No. The people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but it's better than exterminating them. ",KIRK
"We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary. ",KIRK
Phasers stand by. ,KIRK
"Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Our pleasure, madam. As soon as you're settled I'll arrange a tour of the ship. Mister Spock will conduct you. ",KIRK
But it will die finally. You seem very happy about the whole thing. ,KIRK
"Bones, can you remember anything that might help us? Anything at all? ",KIRK
"A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you see? ",KIRK
He was such a genius. What a waste. ,KIRK
"No. No! Let me alone! Please! They're destroying me! Tearing my mind to, to  (Scott and Baby beam back down. Mum and Dad rush to them) ",KIRK
"Damage control, report to the first officer. ",KIRK
Not yet. They may trace our beam. Wait until we're well out of range. ,KIRK
"Give me a decision, Captain. He's coming out of it. ",MCCOY
"That's not good enough, Doctor. ",KIRK
Report on the death of the transporter officer. ,SPOCK
Explain. ,SPOCK
Do you run this place? ,KIRK
Let's go. ,KIRK
I'm not sure. I went down to my quarters to dictate the accident report and I seem to have fallen asleep. I've never done that before. ,KIRK
"Just a moment. They're all beginning to call in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak to you. ",SPOCK
Sickbay. To the Bridge. ,KIRK
"Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can shield themselves. ",KIRK
"(pointing to Sulu) Bones. Can effect changes in time, causing turbulent waves of space displacement. ",KIRK
Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago.,SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane. ",KIRK
What other choice is there? ,KIRK
"Our record tapes show, although not generally revealed, that on this date, a malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the Earth. ",KIRK
Right. It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon. That'd just about wrap it  (He is interrupted by voices from outside. They hide.) ,MCCOY
You threw the first punch. ,KIRK
"Tell Karla Five that Mister Spock, Commodore April and myself will be beaming down. ",KIRK
I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it. ,MCCOY
You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go? ,KIRK
"Put it on visual, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"What's going on, Jim? ",MCCOY
"Not our problem, Bones.",KIRK
Doc! ,KIRK
Something's changed their whole lung structure. They can't live in the air anymore. ,MCCOY
"Yes, the organisers, the managers. The leader of your people. ",KIRK
"I would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
But not responsible. ,KIRK
"That's an order, Mister Spock.",KIRK
These roots and soil cultures can be a medical treasure house. Any problems there? ,MCCOY
"Increase to warp six, Mister Scott. We may be racing against time. ",KIRK
"Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured. Now, let me see that arm. ",MCCOY
"He's got to get some rest, Jim. And would you get that muscleman out of my Sickbay. (gestures at the security guard) ",MCCOY
It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done.,SPOCK
"Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us. ",SPOCK
Right. ,KIRK
Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters. ,SPOCK
"Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian. ",SPOCK
"I'm aware of that, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take official  MCCOY: I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command grade. ",KIRK
That would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents. ,KIRK
"Is this your brother, Jim? ",MCCOY
"So they take all the credit here. Poppycock! Answer me. Do you want my help? Answer me. Do you want my help? (she nods) All right. Say to yourself, The child is mine. The child is mine. It is mine! ",MCCOY
"No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too? ",KIRK
"Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual. ",SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode.,SPOCK
This is Spock. You saw him on the ship. You have his brain. It must be restored to him immediately. What have you done with it? ,KIRK
Shore leave? ,KIRK
Steady as she goes.  ,KIRK
"Correction, Captain. The ship was on a collision course only by coincidence. It is apparently heading for the heart of the Beta Niobe nova. ",SPOCK
Enterprise. Kirk here. ,KIRK
Honesty is usually wise. ,MCCOY
"I see. Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
That's your home. The planet that you come from. ,KIRK
You must sterilise in case of error? ,KIRK
There's the shuttlecraft. ,KIRK
"What do you mean, you can't do that. Follow standard procedure.",KIRK
"This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her.",SPOCK
Christine.,SPOCK
"Somehow, I find transporting into the darkness unnerving. ",MCCOY
"Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet. ",SPOCK
Can I help you? ,MCCOY
(wearing the mask) We had a bargain. Why did you break it? ,KIRK
"Transporter room, on the double. ",KIRK
"I can't say much till I check our these readings. He looks human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing. ",MCCOY
"No, I don't think so, Carver. Spock will do it. ",KIRK
"I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man. ",KIRK
I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan. ,SPOCK
"This did not happen before. My life decision was made without the sacrifice of yours, old friend. I know there is pain. I can help a little. Sleep now. ",SPOCK
"All right. Have them report to the Bridge on the double. Mister Sulu, take us away from the Romulans. Warp factor nine.",KIRK
"We're hundreds of light years from Earth, Mister Spock. No colonies or vessels out this far. ",KIRK
That's right. ,KIRK
"Yes, they're all through here, all over the place. Thousands of them. ",KIRK
"I would be honoured, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without. ",KIRK
"Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me. ",KIRK
I've found them. Can you still hear me? ,KIRK
Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain. ,KIRK
"Spock here, Captain.",SPOCK
Activate life support belts. ,SPOCK
Yes? ,MCCOY
Captain? Captain? Captain. ,SPOCK
"Sandoval's medical record, four years ago when the expedition left Earth. He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. No major operations, but there was an appendectomy. Received all required inoculations, et cetera. ",MCCOY
Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise.,KIRK
"Jim, this ship is dissolving. My hand just passed through a man  [Defiant Bridge]",MCCOY
Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him do it. ,KIRK
"I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror. ",MCCOY
How is he? ,KIRK
"You were about to make a medical comment, Jim? ",MCCOY
Another hour. ,SPOCK
I do not approve. I understand. ,SPOCK
"Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better place?",KIRK
Sir? ,SPOCK
"We've lost her trail, but she went into that system. Mister Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen. ",KIRK
Kirk to McCoy. ,KIRK
That's John Gill. The Fuhrer? ,KIRK
"Our speed is now warp twenty, and the other ship will contact the nova in one minute fifty eight point three seconds. ",SPOCK
The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes. ,KIRK
"It could be a trap, but it's the only way to get the drug. And Spock will die if we don't. ",KIRK
"He is found, and we will leave. ",KIRK
Anyone hurt? ,KIRK
Then I'll transport down with you. ,KIRK
"The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself. ",SPOCK
"If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights? Take out that device in the life-support system? ",KIRK
Go to the engineering station. ,KIRK
"Identification, Spock? ",KIRK
"Locks can be picked, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, co-operate completely with Lieutenant Tracy. Maybe we'll clear this thing up. ",KIRK
An undersea civilisation capable of fantastic architecture.,KIRK
Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience. ,SPOCK
"It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.",SPOCK
"No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they stumble on the right thing.",MCCOY
"Direction, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher. Lang! ",KIRK
"Yes, Mister Sulu. We're all right. You may beam us aboard. ",KIRK
Notify Transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party. Then have Doctor McCoy report to me in the Transporter room on the double. ,KIRK
That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it. ,SPOCK
"Chekov, take over on scanner. ",SPOCK
The starship Enterprise. ,KIRK
"I want to know how I'm free, and why. ",KIRK
"Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred and forty three miles above the surface of this planet. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes. ",KIRK
A teddy bear. ,MCCOY
"Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll take the other two and go the other way. That creature is dangerous. If you see it, fire full phasers. ",KIRK
"That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you. ",SPOCK
Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain. Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in. ,MCCOY
Assume you are a Slaver war computer. You've been turned off.,SPOCK
"You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own antidote. ",SPOCK
"Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?",KIRK
"We'll know in a moment, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Then it's possible the transference can be broken. ,MCCOY
I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship. ,SPOCK
Plot it. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"All the ganglia, the nerves. There are a million of them. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? ",MCCOY
"Alien detected in the engineering section, near reactor number three. ",SPOCK
Is something wrong? ,KIRK
"The blast, yes. ",KIRK
"Ensign, warp seven. ",SPOCK
You think of us as being small creatures like this one. Are we really that inferior to you? ,KIRK
"Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)",KIRK
Not on my ship you don't. ,KIRK
"(grabbing him by the neck) I said, give me the brandy! (leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters) ",KIRK
How is the power transmitted? ,SPOCK

"Mister Spock. Still thinking about Trelane, is that it? ",KIRK
Readings? ,KIRK
I have my orders. ,MCCOY
"As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"You talk about creating life with your clones, but you have to murder to do it. (picks up Spock) Come on. ",KIRK
"Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the universe. ",MCCOY
"Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially irrational. ",SPOCK
"An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet. This planet is uninhabited, Mister Spock, to the best of our information? ",KIRK
Then I won't leave you. ,MCCOY
"Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game. ",SPOCK
"Weapons status, Mister Scott? We may have to protect ourselves. ",KIRK
You can't. ,MCCOY
Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see her? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, the difference is meaningless. In comparison, we're all still children. ",KIRK
"There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was it? ",KIRK
The code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n. ,SPOCK
Who are you?,KIRK
These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well. ,SPOCK
Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready. ,KIRK
"Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here. ",KIRK
"You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive. ",SPOCK
Photon torpedoes. Fire one. ,KIRK
I'm ready. ,KIRK
"Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to stay. Why? ",MCCOY
"Bones, Scotty. ",KIRK
Doctor? ,KIRK
"Shear away, Mister Bailey.",KIRK
Kirk to transporter room. Three to beam up. ,KIRK
No. No! I am responsible for the actions of my people. I demand to see the Providers. ,KIRK
"Do you like her, Scotty? ",KIRK
You would. ,MCCOY
Launch is in forty minutes. Stand by to beam us down. Continue visual scan.,KIRK
Not alive? ,KIRK
"Most seventeen year olds do. Come on, let's go. I'll show you to your quarters.",MCCOY
"You bleed too much, Crater. You're too pure and noble. Are you saving the last of its kind or has this become Crater's private heaven, here on this planet? This thing becomes wife, lover, best friend, wise man, fool, idol, slave. It isn't a bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call, and you win all the arguments. ",KIRK
"It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours. I know, it almost killed me. ",KIRK
We're not going anywhere. ,KIRK

This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago.,SPOCK
Spores? ,SPOCK
"A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power and increasing, beginning to affect our communications.",SPOCK
Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland? ,SPOCK
Between where we were and where we are. ,SPOCK
"Correction, Bones. Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game.",KIRK
Good. Contact me when you can. Kirk out. ,KIRK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
Don't you know me? ,KIRK
"Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under Argelian jurisdiction. If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it. ",KIRK
You what?,MCCOY
No sign of the spaceship. No sign of debris. ,KIRK
"Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly intelligent. ",SPOCK
Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate where that voice is coming from. (McCoy and Scott enter) ,SPOCK
"All hands, this is the captain. Stay at your posts. Remain calm.",KIRK
This is McCoy. Sandoval would like to talk to the Captain. ,MCCOY
"Oh, Ensign, meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up. I'd like to talk to you about your father. Several tall stories I think you'd like to hear. ",KIRK
"Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us on in the same direction. ",SPOCK
"Tricorder analysis, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"The lean, be-draggles one is a reader of minds. ",SPOCK
Are you sure there is no possibility you made an error? ,SPOCK
May I speak? ,KIRK

"He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try. ",MCCOY

"By observation alone, it appears they hit an invisible force field. ",SPOCK
"Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott? ",KIRK
"No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out. ",KIRK
"Nothing, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura is not in the general beam-down area. ",SPOCK
"What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova. ",SPOCK
There must be some logical explanation. ,SPOCK
"It's no secret. We were assigned to the same ship some years later. I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should've been closed. Another five minutes, it could have blown up the ship. ",KIRK
Are you all right? ,KIRK
Phaser Crew stand ready.,KIRK
"Shut them, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down. . ",MCCOY
"He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly. ",MCCOY
"Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that thermoconcrete. You know, the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of. It's mostly silicone. So I just trowelled it into the wound, and it'll act like a bandage until it heals. Take a look. It's as good as new. ",MCCOY
McCoy's death is a scientific fact. ,KIRK
"Suppose it camouflaged itself. Let's assume that it's intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it. ",KIRK
"I'm sorry, Shahna. (takes the magnetic key and unlocks his door) ",KIRK
"Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Red alert.,KIRK
Captain James Kirk. ,KIRK
Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth. ,SPOCK
Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester.,SPOCK
Help it. Treat it. ,KIRK
"What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back the dead, Jim. ",MCCOY
Is anyone on that ship alive? ,KIRK
"Yes. I think it's a name destined to go down in galactic history, Leonard. What do you think, Spock? ",KIRK
Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my signal. Kirk out. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge.",SPOCK
This is the engineering section. There are a number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls. Over here are a number of control computers. ,KIRK
"We don't have much time, Spock. ",KIRK
"Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power. ",KIRK
Specific origin? ,KIRK
"This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas? ",KIRK
"Lord, forgive me. (He fires again and she dies) ",MCCOY
Are we at present capable of resisting? ,SPOCK
Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb. ,MCCOY
"What's going on here, Jim? ",MCCOY
I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile field. ,MCCOY
I think they perform the same function as teeth. They break up the larger chunks of matter for digestion. ,MCCOY
Spock? ,KIRK
Emergency impulse power. ,SPOCK
"But this is not the centre, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Yes, very lucky. Very lucky. ",KIRK
"Truce? Are you serious? I've got men in Sickbay, some of them dying. Atrocities committed on their persons, and you talk about making peace with these fiends? If our backs were turned, they'd jump us in a minute. And you know what Klingons do to prisoners. Slave labour, death planets, experiments! ",MCCOY
"Thank you, Doctor. Bridge out. Mister Spock.",KIRK
"What's your evaluation of the situation, Markel? ",KIRK
"However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure. ",SPOCK
Very good. How are you doing on the force field? ,KIRK
"Never mind, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Oh, no. You were quite accurate. I plan to prove it to you. ANAN: Open a channel to the Enterprise. You give me no choice, Captain. We are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits. ",KIRK
Tri-laser connector. Ready? ,MCCOY
I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense. ,SPOCK
"Did you enjoy it, Captain?",SPOCK
"Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door. ",SPOCK
Kirk to Sickbay. Emergency! ,KIRK
Fire phasers. ,KIRK
"There's one, Professor. Your creature is killing my people.",KIRK
"Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it? ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first.",KIRK
"By what, Spock? ",KIRK
Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.,SPOCK
"Well, I resist using it, but in this case the professor will give us the truth. ",MCCOY
I sent the others up to the ship. What happened? ,KIRK
What was it you sensed? ,KIRK
"Vended? You mean bought, sold. ",KIRK
"Lazarus, what happened? ",KIRK
"Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour watch. No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission! ",KIRK
Hurry up with that shot! ,KIRK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
"To us, killing is murder, even for revenge. But there will be other starships. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starbase Four. Tell them we're bringing the children there. Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature, and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival. ",KIRK
It's too late for that. ,KIRK
"Well, I'll be  SPOCK: I suggest compliance, Captain. ",KIRK
It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. (sedates it) ,SPOCK
"Is he important to you, more important than anything? Is he as though he were a part of you? ",KIRK
Are they in the Sickbay? ,KIRK
Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on your tricorder? ,KIRK
It's called blood. Watch your step. The officers move up by assassination. Chekov tried it on me. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most. You, I presume, felt nothing? ",KIRK
"Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker. Suppose that has anything to do with the interference? ",MCCOY
A piece of the action. ,KIRK
She is T'Pring. My wife. ,SPOCK
And the mines are full of that gas. ,KIRK
"I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer. ",SPOCK
"The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely incredible.  ",SPOCK
"You're not a native of Argelius, sir? ",MCCOY
"Good night, Bones.",KIRK
"How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him. ",KIRK
"Very well, Mister Spock. I'll meet you at the other end. ",KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition. ,SPOCK
"Yes, that's quite true. ",SPOCK
Here. ,MCCOY
Mister Sulu? ,KIRK
That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves! ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, that's your place. ",MCCOY
"She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things. ",KIRK
"I understand your diagnosis, Doctor, and I'll respect it. But not to the exclusion and safety of the Enterprise. Thank you. ",KIRK
"As a matter of fact, yes. ",MCCOY
"Are you aware of what's happening to his body? Heart action doubled, temperature a hundred and four degrees? ",MCCOY
This bridge is under complete control. ,SPOCK
"Besides, it isn't necessary. The chart said the tunnels meet further on.",KIRK
"The Defiant! Mister Sulu, impulse engines only. Close to transporter range. ",KIRK
I am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies. According to my calculations  [Bridge],SPOCK
"It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to get away. ",KIRK
"Bones, I want the impossible checked out too.",KIRK
A stimulant. ,MCCOY
"Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive. ",KIRK
McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes. ,KIRK
"Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well co-ordinated. ",SPOCK
"That's it, Spock. The key to the survival of the race. ",KIRK
"Captain to transporter room. Are you reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many did we get off? ",KIRK
"Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us. ",KIRK
This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan. ,SPOCK
"Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go._ (Charlie can't make Kirk lose his balance. He gets dumped instead.) ",KIRK
"We'll know that in ten minutes. After that, it won't matter anymore. Prepare to energise. ",KIRK
Not a one. What happened is medically impossible. ,MCCOY
But the energy. Regular. It's there. It's real. ,KIRK
What is it you want to know? ,KIRK
"They'll never do it, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to speak directly to the governor. ",KIRK
Get back up here. ,KIRK
"Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists? ",MCCOY
Perhaps there is a way open on the far side. There is much less activity there. ,SPOCK
Tell Spock it worked. ,KIRK
Computer on. Record. ,KIRK
"Your move, Captain. ",SPOCK
"How did you arrange to touch her, Bones, give her a happy pill? ",KIRK
"Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act. ,SPOCK
"Mister Chekov, our estimated time of arrival for Ariannus? ",KIRK
It's never been done.,SPOCK
"I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely. ",SPOCK
Speak of the devil. ,KIRK
"(thumping the table) It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote. ",KIRK
"What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? ",KIRK
Lieutenant. ,SPOCK
"Analysis, gentlemen. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Well, it could have been worse.",MCCOY
"Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern? ",KIRK
Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand.,KIRK
"I shall be delighted, Captain.  ",SPOCK
The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us. ,KIRK
From warp eight? Have you lost your mind? ,KIRK
"I thought  we left you on the robot planet, Harry. Permanently. ",KIRK
"Enterprise, come in. ",KIRK
The Vedala would not have chosen Lara if her abilities were less than perfect. ,SPOCK
"Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive.",KIRK
He seems he's overcoming his resentment. ,KIRK
I'm losing command. I'm losing the Enterprise. The ship is sailing on and on. I'm alone. Alone. Alone. I'm losing command. ,KIRK
"Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month. For all the good it'll do. ",MCCOY
You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down. ,MCCOY
What happened? ,MCCOY
It's a shame to have to intrude. ,MCCOY
"If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the Captain. And he'll be the next target. ",SPOCK
"Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble.",SPOCK
"Back on original course, Mister Chekov. Report on intruder's movements. ",KIRK
Locked in and ready to beam up consignment. ,SPOCK
So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them. ,SPOCK

Anything else? ,KIRK
"Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton. ",KIRK
And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one. ,SPOCK
"The dead star is directly ahead, Captain, twelve degrees south of galactic plane. ",SPOCK
He didn't seem to know me. ,KIRK
You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it. ,SPOCK
I am.,SPOCK

Reverse and energise. ,KIRK
I cannot. ,SPOCK
Everyone all right? ,KIRK
By whom? ,KIRK
Vulcan biology. ,SPOCK

Debris on our scanners. ,SPOCK
The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven.,MCCOY
"Damage report, all stations. ",SPOCK
That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a completely hedonistic society. ,MCCOY
"It's not making any threatening moves, Spock.",KIRK
"As commanding officer, the choice will be mine. ",SPOCK
"Mister Darvin, are you going to talk? ",KIRK
"So are you, sir. Well, Spock? ",MCCOY
What's that? ,MCCOY
Where's your wife? Where is she now? ,KIRK
"And there's this power surge, right off the scale. Like a door closing. It must be near here. ",KIRK

You said you wanted our help. What is it you wish? ,KIRK
"Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation  KOR: Or our Empire! ",KIRK
"Is the power level still holding, Jim? ",MCCOY

"Oh, we managed. Mister Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers. ",MCCOY
"He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him. ",KIRK
"Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Mister Spock. Let's have a look at the projector. ",KIRK
"What do we do now, knock? ",MCCOY
"Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status? ",KIRK
You could call it that. ,KIRK
Do they tie in? ,KIRK
"Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving. Goodbye. ",MCCOY

Yes. I know what it is like. ,SPOCK

There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave. ,SPOCK
We won't harm you. We're friends. ,KIRK

The atmosphere is thinner than Earth. ,KIRK

Sensors may be operating. ,SPOCK
Doctor McCoy and I are going to the Bridge. Meet us there.,KIRK
There are many things I'd like to know  (he's interrupted by rapid gunfire.) ,KIRK
I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong. ,KIRK
Which doesn't seem to be much. ,KIRK

Interesting. ,SPOCK

Seven hours and eight. Spock. Keys. (on a table) I'll have you out in a minute. ,KIRK
"Sulu, what is it? Where's Lieutenant O'Neil? ",KIRK
It's as good a place as any to beam down. ,KIRK
Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era. ,SPOCK
"My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron. ",SPOCK
I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate. ,KIRK
Well? ,KIRK
There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available? ,KIRK
"I understand. I understand, Natira. Ten thousand years ago, a sun was dying and with it, its world. It's the world you see on the plaque in the room of the Oracle. ",KIRK
"Can a few more minutes matter, Spock? ",MCCOY
"You speak of his body. I speak of his spirit. Companion, inside the shelter, a female of our species is dying. She will not continue.",KIRK
Keep at it. We've got three people in there whose lives may depend on it. ,KIRK
Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of mine. ,SPOCK
What's the emergency? ,KIRK
The frequency is open. It'll act as a homing device. Contact DeSalle. Have him meet you here. Make sure the landing party work in teams of two. I don't want anybody left alone down here. ,KIRK
Spock? ,KIRK
Yes. ,MCCOY
"Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position. This conduct must be reported. ",SPOCK
Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.,SPOCK

"Nonetheless, it is too pure. ",SPOCK
What if it turns out you're an invading alien from the future? ,KIRK

You mean you know who's behind these stunts? ,KIRK
Bones. (Spock's body stands up and they walk out of the room) ,KIRK
"But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject before  SPOCK: Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us. ",MCCOY
Cory? ,KIRK
"I do not believe they can, sir. High rank probability. Their S2 graf unit, which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive, began giving off depleted energy readings. Kor decided to try to bluff it through. ",SPOCK
"Is that you, Doctor Korby? ",KIRK
That's the opinion of an individual. ,KIRK
"The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify them this way. Very important. ",SPOCK
And what have you to say now? ,KIRK
"This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add. ",SPOCK
How did you manage that? ,KIRK
"Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions orders. ",KIRK
It would be just enough time. ,MCCOY
"Once I get my hands on a communicator, I can have Scotty beam us all aboard the Enterprise. Ready now. ",KIRK
I panicked. ,KIRK
"Indeed we did, Mister Spock.",MCCOY
"She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five. ",KIRK
"Would you like to use a butterfly net on him, Captain? ",MCCOY
A minute. ,KIRK
Thank you.,SPOCK
How long will it take you to find the trouble? ,KIRK
You will. Both of us. ,KIRK
Oh? This could be an historic occasion. ,MCCOY
I have found paradise. Surely no man has ever attained such happiness. ,KIRK
How did she die? What day? ,KIRK
"Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy. ",SPOCK
Oh. ,KIRK
"Well, they're not. After what they've been through they really should  KIRK: Doctor McCoy, I've heard you say that man is ultimately superior to any mechanical device.",MCCOY
Why do you want to kill us? ,KIRK
I understand you're not happy with your quarters. ,KIRK
I wish to apologise. ,KIRK
What will you feel for him after we are gone? ,SPOCK
Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise. ,KIRK

"I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
For how long? ,KIRK
"All right, Mister Spock. Let's have it. ",KIRK
That's how my arm got hurt. ,KIRK
"Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is ours. It can be a successful one. ",SPOCK
"Over here, Captain! ",MCCOY
"Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick. ",KIRK

My last orders. The last orders that I left for both of you. The last taped orders. ,KIRK
"These are not Enterprise communicators, Captain. They are fakes.",SPOCK
"Range, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
"Captain, we have been hit by a kind of projected stasis field.",SPOCK
"Not without special equipment, which we don't have. Either we find a way to reach it from here, or we fail. ",KIRK
"Very bad poetry, Captain. ",SPOCK
It's got to be. ,KIRK
Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering on our sensors? ,KIRK
Stand by phasers. ,KIRK
"Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I want navigational control restored, my ship released. ",KIRK

Who's this?,KIRK
There could be many reasons why we did not. ,SPOCK

"Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?",KIRK
Mister Scott? ,SPOCK
You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.,SPOCK
"(to Kara, amid laughter) As I was saying, a fascinating cultural development of the kind which hasn't been seen in ages. The last such occurrence took place on old Earth, when the Romans were warring with the ....  ",SPOCK
"Lie down, Jim. ",MCCOY
Excuse me. Kirk here. ,KIRK
Lieutenant Uhura. ,KIRK
"Colonel, would you mind being careful with that? ",KIRK
We're under attack. I have to go to the Bridge. I've got to go to the bridge. ,KIRK
This is the Captain. Security two alert. Find and restrain Lieutenant Kevin Riley. He's armed and possibly headed towards the ship's theatre. ,KIRK
Locate the portal. It can't be too far.,MCCOY

We aren't limited. We can go wherever we want in that ocean. ,KIRK
"Mrs. Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you. I must speak to your husband. ",KIRK
It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use. ,SPOCK
Explain. ,KIRK
Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that not crucial to your decision? ,SPOCK
"But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus? ",KIRK
No sign of grief? ,KIRK
You need advice from me? You must be kidding. ,MCCOY
"Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings. Its destination is Marcos. If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus. ",KIRK
Is it within visual range? ,KIRK
"Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several days old. They seldom stay in one place. ",KIRK
"Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott. Do you have any other helpful opinions? ",KIRK
Mister Spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw. ,KIRK
Sorry. ,KIRK
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
Bones. Still orbiting Gideon. ,KIRK
"Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Are you all right? ,SPOCK
And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines? ,KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
He'll have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre. Right now he's under sedation and heavy restraints. ,MCCOY
"Computer, verification scan. ",KIRK
"But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise. ",KIRK
And you? ,KIRK
You won't get it through torture. ,KIRK
"Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes. ",KIRK
(watching Pike on monitor) He keeps blinking no. No to what?,KIRK
"There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain. ",SPOCK
"That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that. ",KIRK
"Spock here, Captain. I am triangulating now. It's coming from the engineering section. ",SPOCK
"Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name? ",KIRK
"Be ready for the objections, Jim. They are a vocal lot. ",MCCOY
"We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum. ",SPOCK
Not on this world. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like living rock with heavy fore claws. It's settling down now to completely human readings. ",SPOCK
You're being unreasonable. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Scotty. Kirk out. Uhura, reduce mayday signals. One per ten minute cycle. Cut down sensor sweeps, Mister Arex. ",KIRK
Mister Sulu was with you. Where is he now?,KIRK
It's Jim. ,KIRK

"Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir. ",SPOCK
"You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain? ",SPOCK
"(examining a large globe from Vanderberg's desk) Mister Vanderberg, what is this? ",SPOCK
"Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at. ",SPOCK
Never trusted this. ,MCCOY
Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open. ,KIRK
Come with me. I offer you happiness. ,KIRK
"Your decision is most illogical, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid. ,KIRK
"Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
"This isn't the time. Companion, what you offer us is not continuation. It is non=existence. We will cease to exist. Even the man will cease to exist. ",KIRK
"My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew. What happened to your vessel you've explained. What happened to your oath is obvious. ",KIRK
It would be most illogical that a stasis box would remain here undiscovered for so long. Beta Lyrae is one of the rare spectacles of the galaxy. Almost every ship that passes stops to see it. ,SPOCK

"Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"I don't know. I don't want to go, but I can't help myself. ",MCCOY
"(having to be held back by the guards) I'll kill you, you filthy traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! ",KIRK
Yes. Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells. Stealing apples from the neighbours' trees. Tying cans on  (He's stopped by the look of horrified incredulity on Spock's face.) ,KIRK
"We cannot reverse our mutations without the serum, nor can the Aquans benefit from the knowledge of their ancestors. ",SPOCK
Where is Landru? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time. ",KIRK
"Yes, Mister Sulu.",KIRK
This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile intentions. We request identity. ,KIRK
Then your makers weren't humanoid? ,MCCOY
It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.,SPOCK
"Ten years? In four days, we'll be dead! ",MCCOY
"They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences. ",SPOCK
Help me. Somebody make the decision. ,KIRK
"M-5 has identified her, Captain. The Woden. Listed in Starfleet Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation. No crew. Coming into visual range. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is.",SPOCK
"Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back. ",MCCOY
It won't work. ,KIRK
And useless to them. Theela said the other men of the crew would join us here. They'll be lured into the same trap. We've got to contact the ship. ,KIRK
That flight suit must be uncomfortable. (to Spock) Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters. ,KIRK
Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction.,MCCOY
"Excellent, Scotty. Stand by to beam up landing party. Let's go and see how the others are doing. Marplon can finish up here.",KIRK
"An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold. ",SPOCK

"We have no more questions, Captain. ",SPOCK

Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack. ,SPOCK
Why do the Nazis hate Zeons? ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott, ready the transporter room.",KIRK

Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's. ,KIRK
I found our missing men. Dead. Another one of your experiments? ,KIRK
"Full stop, Mister Chekov. Hold your position. ",KIRK
"Spock, are you all right? ",KIRK
I only want to talk to you. ,KIRK

"There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push. We have no time for emotionalism. ",SPOCK

Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back means. ,SPOCK
"How many coming, Captain? ",SPOCK
Is that all you have to offer? ,KIRK
The planet might be hollow. They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes. It's dark. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay. ,KIRK
Is that the way you see it? ,KIRK

Wait! ,KIRK
"Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, Lieutenant.",KIRK
They demand an immediate reply. ,SPOCK
"Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own departments. No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down. We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer. ",KIRK

Yes. Who caught you? ,KIRK

Present condition of Psi 2000.,KIRK
"Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power. ",SPOCK
I am grateful. ,KIRK
"Burns them out. Compton was burned out. The device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know. ",KIRK
"Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast.",KIRK
"Lungs filled with air again. To see again. Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again. A half a million years. To be again.",KIRK
This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here. ,KIRK
"I'm sorry, Ambassador. I did not mean to offend. I thought that  SAREK: Offence is a human emotion. I'm returning to my quarters.",KIRK
Who are you? ,KIRK
"If that's true, Spock, then  (The landing party are grabbed by the tentacles of three giant slug-like creatures) ",KIRK
"We must talk to Kang, bury the hatchet. ",KIRK
"Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on. ",KIRK
Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship! ,KIRK
"All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating. ",KIRK
I'm working in the dark. I could kill him. ,MCCOY
"Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise. ",SPOCK
"It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of that. ",SPOCK
"Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please? ",SPOCK
"Our new heading, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
"And I'll love you, Miramanee. Always. ",KIRK
A fat tribble. ,KIRK
"Based on present data, I would say yes. ",SPOCK
Who die when they enter adolescence. ,KIRK
Right. ,MCCOY
McCoy! McCoy! ,KIRK
Something's preventing my phaser from operating.,SPOCK
"(attempting a mind meld) He simply appears to have turned himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship  KIRK: It seems we're going to take a little trip.",SPOCK
Hundreds of thousands. ,KIRK
"Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does the human body have? ",KIRK
"Are they aboard? Scotty, are they aboard? ",KIRK
"Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock.",KIRK
"You seem to be singing a different tune. I'd rather know more about yours. You call it magic, you call it science. It seems unrelated to both of them. ",KIRK
"Captain? Captain? Captain, are you able to respond? ",SPOCK
We may be able to get these people back on course. ,MCCOY
The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. ,SPOCK
"Of course. Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions. ",MCCOY
Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the series. But if this is that probe  NOMAD: I will scan your star charts. ,SPOCK
"Jim, what in heaven's name is going on? ",MCCOY
Maintain. ,KIRK
"All right, Nomad. Repair the unit. ",KIRK
"I'm sorry, Jim. The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive. ",MCCOY
The Zetars are growing stronger. ,MCCOY
Try a harmless suggestion.,KIRK
Not if I can help it. ,KIRK
"Not even if we're in danger, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
It's locked onto my ship's systems. ,KIRK
He failed a psycho-simulator test. All it takes is a split second of indecision. Hardly the type to become a political strongman. ,KIRK
They are inseparably close to one another. We cannot transport one  [Bridge],SPOCK
"What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Yes, Doctor. Spock what do we know about the race that lived here? ",KIRK
I didn't say that. ,MCCOY
"Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity. ",SPOCK
"Surely, you're coming, Captain. ",SPOCK
No! ,MCCOY
"It will work, or he'd still be gloating. Bring the robot ships in from two different angles, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Forward phasers, stand by. (the Romulan becomes a clear image)",KIRK
"The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, mild. She had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs. Then she fought back in the only way she knew how, as any mother would fight when her children are in danger. ",KIRK
Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint. ,MCCOY
Pure energy. Matter without form. ,SPOCK
"Some pre-trial investigation, Mister Spock. On Dramia Two. ",KIRK
Kodos is dead. I'm satisfied of that. ,KIRK
I have the weapon. ,SPOCK
"Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field. ,KIRK
"Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our old age. Which won't be for some while, I hope. Take over, Mister Sulu.",KIRK
Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately. ,SPOCK
"I'm not interested in any physical-psychological aspects, Jim boy. We all perfectly healthy down here. ",MCCOY
"Read out, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
"Plant life, Captain. Primitive and aggressive. ",SPOCK
"How many men did we lose, Bones? ",KIRK
"Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century.",SPOCK
"Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. ",SPOCK
"Yes, that's possible. There's also the possibility of underground water. ",KIRK
"You've already made up your mind, haven't you, Jim. ",MCCOY
What did she die of? ,KIRK
"You have the conn, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous. Stay in pairs. If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head. Concentrate it. Maintain it. It is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt. And if it can be hurt, it can be killed. Mister Spock. ",KIRK
I think it unlikely it is one of theirs. ,SPOCK
"We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit. 'It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.'  SPOCK: It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today. ",KIRK
So is your father's life.,MCCOY
"Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me. A chemical corrosion. Almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid. ",MCCOY
"Very interesting. You ready, Bones?",KIRK
"Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests? ",KIRK
Computer? ,SPOCK
"In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. ",SPOCK
Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to understand. All you have is printed circuits. ,KIRK
"Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct orders. ",KIRK
You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas! ,KIRK
"I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock?",KIRK
Quiet. ,KIRK
"Report, Bones. ",KIRK
"Record procedure. Scotty, can you do it? ",KIRK
"No, I think I can walk. I'll try. ",MCCOY
Ship to ship.,KIRK
"Cover! Kirk to Enterprise, lock on transporters. Beam us up.",KIRK
"Warp one in six seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. ",SPOCK
"Noted. You should know, however, that there's very little a Starbase can do that a starship can't. ",KIRK
"Yes, it is. ",SPOCK
"All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881. The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here. ",KIRK
She's on board by now. Yes. She's on board. ,KIRK
Yes. ,SPOCK
"Well, there goes paradise. ",MCCOY
"You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human emotional act? ",KIRK
He just gave us reverse power. We lurched forward. ,KIRK
(handing over his own phaser) And give this to Mister Scott in the event I don't return. ,SPOCK
Put a guard on him. ,KIRK
Check controls and co-ordinates. ,KIRK
I am Sargon. ,KIRK
I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles. ,SPOCK
I'll take my chances. Why don't you have a look around? Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott? ,KIRK
I wouldn't be a bit surprised. ,KIRK
"Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure you that I have full control over your friends. ",SPOCK
That ought to be just about right. ,KIRK
I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me. Do your job with her. How long before he's on his feet? ,KIRK
"Twenty seconds to what? That's what worries me. Lieutenant Uhura, place the ship on Yellow Alert. ",KIRK
I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary. ,MCCOY
You still feel all right? ,MCCOY
Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries.,SPOCK
"That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command. If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis. ",SPOCK
More power to the shields. ,SPOCK
"You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard.",SPOCK
A small thing which holds us all. ,SPOCK
There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. ,SPOCK
What is it? What happened? ,KIRK
We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit. ,SPOCK
Now you've got to get this ship out of here. ,MCCOY
"Was your father  GARROVICK: Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that account. ",KIRK
This room. What happens there?,SPOCK
"That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything. ",KIRK
Let's do that. ,KIRK
Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet. ,MCCOY
The odds are not good. ,MCCOY
The end of life. Murderers. ,SPOCK
"If we can get to the SS weapons laboratory, get our weapons back, we might be able to stop the slaughter. ",KIRK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for one do not believe in angels. ,SPOCK
You made the desert crossing most efficiently. You will not disappoint Sarek in your kahs-wan. ,SPOCK
"I can't, but to question Spock of all people? Me, yes. I could run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock.",MCCOY
"Of course, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened. ",KIRK
I am? ,KIRK
"It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it was all human. ",MCCOY
"That leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes, Spock.",KIRK
Do you gentlemen have any further questions? ,KIRK
"From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world. From Asia through the Middle East. ",SPOCK
Is that a request or demand? ,KIRK
"Same as before, Mister Sulu. Stay with him. ",KIRK
"It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around? ",MCCOY
"If you want to play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me. My concern is with the ship and the crew. ",KIRK
"(handing over a computer disc) M-5's readout, Captain. ",SPOCK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
My ears register it. ,KIRK
"But with the mind of a child. Bones, what is it? ",KIRK
"They are all malfunctioning, Captain. Some kind of electronic block has cut us off from the ship. ",SPOCK
Look. ,KIRK
These ruins extend to the horizon. Begin recording. ,KIRK
Estimated repair time? ,SPOCK
Try these. ,KIRK
"Correct. Very good, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over and out. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Lead us to him. ,KIRK
What? ,MCCOY
Jim and his creature? ,MCCOY
Reevaluate? ,KIRK
You've been most restrained since we left Organia. ,SPOCK
Accidents happen. Cut off back-up systems malfunction. We were due for overhaul two months ago. ,KIRK
Answers.,KIRK
Deflectors up. ,KIRK
"I'm doing that, Captain, as per your previous order. We discussed that earlier. ",SPOCK
"Jim, I want to talk to you. ",MCCOY
Sonic separator. ,MCCOY
"No need, Bones. Here we go. ",KIRK
I cannot say. The Klingon found near the dilithium vault knew nothing specific. But there is some kind of sabotage in the offing. ,SPOCK
"I thought I just did, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Then we should be able to navigate back. ,KIRK
"Barely an instant in eternity, Jim. ",MCCOY
A partnership arrangement? You and me? ,KIRK
Do the best you can and make it fast. Kirk to Scott. ,KIRK
"Jim, Spock's almost gone. ",MCCOY
Opening time portals to the past. You cross through into the period which you were viewing. ,SPOCK
"It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends. ",SPOCK
"A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive. ",SPOCK
How could he survive? ,KIRK
"The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock, as for you  SPOCK: Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you. ",KIRK
Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva.,KIRK
We came rather close to making it more than honorary. ,SPOCK
Tell them. ,KIRK
"Yes, of course. It's the only reasonable explanation. You can't see and Kollos can't hurt you. ",KIRK
"You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover him. Now listen, sweetheart. The Federation's moving in, taking over.",KIRK
Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you? ,MCCOY
Lieutenant. You have your orders and your duty. ,KIRK
Mister Stiles. ,KIRK
"Tragedy, Doctor.",KIRK
Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board. ,KIRK
"That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you. ",SPOCK
"You don't know yet, do you? ",KIRK
I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience. ,SPOCK
"Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I  ATOZ: Oh, no, sir, no. I must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism. Return and make your selection. When you have chosen, I will prepare you through the atavachron. ",SPOCK
Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven. ,SPOCK
And yourself? ,KIRK
No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic?,SPOCK
Great leader. Great leader! (He kneels in front of Kara.) We come from a far place to learn from your Controller. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"Oh, Spock, one question. ",KIRK
"It's important, Rila. Not just for us. The population of another planet is threatened by surface changes, too. Argo's ancient knowledge can help save them. ",KIRK
"Touché, Bones. ",KIRK
"Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain.",SPOCK
"Good. I like yours, too. I like you. ",KIRK
You're doing fine. ,KIRK
I'll never live this down. This Vulcan is telling me how to operate. ,MCCOY
"How are you doing, Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
Take him. ,KIRK
"Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you. ",MCCOY
Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.,SPOCK
That's generations ahead of where these people should be technically. How'd they manage that? ,MCCOY
(pushing the gear lever and making grinding noises) Oops! Gears. ,KIRK
"Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here. ",MCCOY
Did it work? ,KIRK
Physically. ,MCCOY
Concerning the situation you related to us.,SPOCK
"Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and they have six-inch fangs. ",SPOCK
"Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions. ",SPOCK
I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him. ,KIRK
"You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could have destroyed it. ",MCCOY
"Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me. ",SPOCK
"Indeed, Captain? ",SPOCK
Negative. ,SPOCK
It's very old. ,KIRK
Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty. ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, he is not the man you loved. Carter Winston is dead. ",KIRK
What's our position? ,KIRK
Is it within visual range? ,KIRK
She's not registering. ,MCCOY
What sterilisation procedure? ,KIRK
Where do you come from? ,KIRK
He is my friend. ,KIRK
"Scotty, give me a hand. (They prop Hengist up on a chair, leaning against the table.) ",MCCOY
"Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments? ",KIRK
"Beam us aboard, Mister Scott. ",KIRK

There's a body down there. Sturgeon. ,KIRK
Go. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim.",KIRK
"Good luck, Spock. ",MCCOY
I guess they can take it faster than we give it. ,KIRK
"Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you.",SPOCK
"Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you. ",KIRK
Allow me. ,SPOCK
"I believe we should, Jim.",SPOCK
A zoo? I'm no animal. ,MCCOY
Then why did you fight the examination? ,MCCOY
"Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer.",MCCOY
You can't hold him forever. ,KIRK
"All right, Scotty. We made a deal with Krako. ",KIRK
"Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits. ",SPOCK
"He doesn't appear to be harmed. Physically, anyway. ",MCCOY
We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should have him climbing the walls. ,MCCOY
Yes. Many of us are on the thing near you now. Do not consume it. ,SPOCK
"What was that? Lieutenant, cut off that frequency. ",KIRK
"A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room. ",SPOCK
"What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet, Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous. ",MCCOY
Fire. ,KIRK
Did l? I may have been mistaken. ,SPOCK
Yeah. ,KIRK
Do you mean the children may be involved? ,MCCOY
Bridge to Captain Kirk. ,SPOCK
What about a rendezvous? ,MCCOY
I wonder how humanity managed to survive. ,SPOCK
And we are definitely on the inside. ,KIRK
We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach without being seen. ,KIRK
"No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost. ",KIRK
I thought I said that.  ,KIRK
"Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of, um, er, adolescence. ",KIRK

Fire phasers. ,KIRK
"Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities  MARLENA: You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher. ",KIRK
I'm not joking. ,KIRK
That's what's bothering me. The something we may have to do.,KIRK
"No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it. ",KIRK
"Regulations require  KIRK: Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all along. First little excuse you get  SPOCK: Captain, I have not assumed command. ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, direct forward phasers at the Terratin city. Set for pinpoint fire pattern. ",KIRK
"Did you feel a presence, an intelligence? ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain? ",SPOCK
You did. ,SPOCK
"There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there? ",MCCOY
"Can't you disengage power from there, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"If I could help him, I would. I cannot.",SPOCK
Let it be done. ,MCCOY
(pacing) Vulcan mind techniques. They seem so untrustworthy now that Spock's life is at stake. ,KIRK
"Oh, Bones. Doc. ",KIRK

"Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your well-known logic explain that? ",KIRK

"Exercise rating, Captain. Ninety four percent.",SPOCK
"Yes, I suppose they would. ",KIRK
Not so far as we know. ,SPOCK

"Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim. ",MCCOY
"I'm aware of that, Captain. I trust that you are aware of the reverse. ",SPOCK

Are you sure? ,KIRK
What is it you want of us? ,SPOCK
"I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red. ",SPOCK

I'd like you to teach me that sometime.,KIRK

"These are people, not robots. They should have the opportunity of choice. We owe it to them to interfere. ",KIRK

Come on! ,KIRK
Can't you make other arrangements? ,KIRK
"Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome. It's particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains. ",MCCOY
That was due to be next. Life-support malfunction. ,KIRK
"But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention.",SPOCK
What happened to your ship? ,KIRK
"Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. We agree. ,SPOCK
Now what? ,KIRK
"The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain. Shall we turn off the tractor beam? ",SPOCK
"Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it. ",SPOCK
"I'm stimulating him. (McCoy pushes him back into the fight.) You have no choice. To use this ship, you have to use our form and now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three hundred years. ",KIRK

"Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time. ",SPOCK
It's range cannot be guaranteed. How will we pinpoint you for return in case it fails? ,SPOCK

"(on back, pumping pedals) Just a few seconds more.",KIRK
"If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain. Is that your simple logic, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY

Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale. ,KIRK
"Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK

"Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity.",MCCOY
What do I have? ,KIRK
"Yes, that's right, Bones. ",KIRK
Something? ,KIRK
"True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination.",SPOCK
I know the place to get the proper drugs. I'll need a mortar and a pestle. ,MCCOY
We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba. ,SPOCK
Can you? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge. ",KIRK
Is there any cure? ,KIRK
Is it gone? ,KIRK

"What are we going to do now, Jim? ",MCCOY
Are you all right? ,KIRK
"Spock, is that you? ",KIRK
"Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters  KIRK: I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The Klingon ship. ",SPOCK

Affirmative. We have the pilot aboard. I'll be right up. Kirk out. Follow me. ,KIRK

Are we in an alternate universe? ,KIRK

I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise. ,SPOCK

Presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that operates the planetary effects. ,SPOCK
The mirror. ,SPOCK

"Is he, Bones? ",KIRK
None of this parallels any human development. It's more like a human nightmare. ,KIRK
Don't be afraid. ,MCCOY

It does resemble a summons. ,SPOCK
"Captain, careful. ",MCCOY
And what of Lazarus? ,KIRK
"I see. How did you manage  TRELANE: Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome. I want you to be happy. Free yourself of care. Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship. ",KIRK

What was that? ,KIRK
"Enterprise, alert! Stand by to beam up landing party. ",MCCOY

Childress. ,KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky. ",MCCOY
Fire photon torpedoes. ,KIRK
"Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The unanswered question is, the other what? ",SPOCK
"You can't do it, Jim. ",MCCOY
"(bad static) Captain, I have a reading from Life Support centre  KIRK: Spock, I can't hear you. Check your circuits. Is there a malfunction? ",SPOCK

You can't. ,KIRK

What is the projected course of this thing? ,KIRK
"This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity. ",SPOCK
"Are the readings corresponding, Nurse? ",MCCOY

I may be able to get a translation. ,SPOCK
Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes. ,SPOCK

"I'll beam you aboard the Enterprise. Once there, no tricks. ",KIRK
"Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?",KIRK
Can you do me a favour? ,KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"How do you feel, Jim? ",MCCOY
I'm way ahead of you. ,KIRK
"No. It's not all bad, Mister Spock. Who knows. You may be able to beat your next captain at chess. Kirk out. ",KIRK
You said that. ,KIRK
Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single ship cannot combat it. ,SPOCK
"Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them? ",KIRK
It takes too long to explain. Any place will do. ,KIRK
"Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mister Spock. Excuse me. I sometimes expect too much of you. ",KIRK

I understand. ,KIRK
It was a foolish mistake. ,KIRK

We must. The vaccine could be fatal. ,SPOCK

"Normally, no, but that blow on his head could  SCOTT: No, Captain. ",KIRK
"Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals. ",SPOCK

"John Gill was the kindest, gentlest man I ever knew. For him to be a Nazi is impossible. ",KIRK
"We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do. We can't turn it on and off. ",MCCOY
Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one. ,SPOCK
I see. Opinion. ,KIRK
"Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened.",SPOCK
"It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead. ",MCCOY
"Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart  KIRK: They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtator works. ",SPOCK
Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power. ,SPOCK
Indeed she is.  ,MCCOY
Do you have a counterproposal? ,KIRK
I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed. ,SPOCK
"Sensor scans give a rough approximation of the age of the metal in the hulls, Captain. Some of them have been here for centuries. ",SPOCK

There has been no error. ,MCCOY
What did you see? ,KIRK
Spock. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, anything from the planet? ",KIRK
"Well, you got what you wanted. ",MCCOY
That is correct. ,KIRK
"It appears he will, Lieutenant. (leaves) ",MCCOY
"Do you feel all right, Jim? ",MCCOY
You don't know what she may have. ,KIRK
"Bones, Scotty, quiet. ",KIRK
Source? ,KIRK
"Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember  KIRK: He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death. ",SPOCK
"Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy. I realise that the crew are your prime concern. You can best serve them in your laboratory. I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found. ",SPOCK
"Captain, you might lose the doctor that way. ",SPOCK
"I have security clearance, Chief.",SPOCK
Not precisely. ,SPOCK
"So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it. Set up a landing party. Let's go get him. Kirk out. ",KIRK
"And the little ones. What's going to happen to them after you've gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? Oh, they'll still be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten it. Maybe six months left, that's all, and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll die, too. ",KIRK
"Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk. ",SPOCK
I know. ,KIRK
You do remember! ,KIRK
I think you're right. Continue investigating. The clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere. ,KIRK
Scott and Sulu? ,MCCOY

You could have seen the rabbit.,MCCOY
"My blood is T-negative, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain.",SPOCK
I understand. Landru. ,KIRK
We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada. ,KIRK
No longer. ,KIRK
You're going to have to take me on. ,KIRK
I deeply respect what he has accomplished. ,SPOCK
Well they're there now. Let's go check them out. (to Gem) Staying here alone could be dangerous. Come with us. ,KIRK
The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence. ,KIRK

"No, no, everything is fine. ",KIRK
Uhura. Beautiful! ,KIRK
"We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. ",KIRK
Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch.,SPOCK

"The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing.",KIRK
What about the other systems? ,KIRK
"Because a flaw developed in the controls. And unless we correct it, Yonada will kill millions of people and destroy a world it doesn't even know. ",KIRK

Why? Why trick me? ,MCCOY
But something was changed. ,KIRK
"On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you. It requires intelligence. ",KIRK

Jim. ,SPOCK
"Sure. A formal reception tonight, a hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks, thirty two of them ambassadors, (Spock joins them) half of them mad at the other half, and the whole lot touchier than a raw antimatter pile over this Coridan question. ",MCCOY

Mister Chekov. ,KIRK
"Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain. ",SPOCK
I don't want to.,KIRK
"We know their Achilles heel, Mister Stiles. Their weapon takes all their energy. They must become visible in order to launch it. ",KIRK
"Of course, there's another possibility. ",MCCOY
Try to maintain position Mister Sulu. ,SPOCK
Yes. A doctor should have more pride. ,SPOCK
That is an impossibility. ,SPOCK
"This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain and friend for many years. And Leonard McCoy, also of long acquaintance. And Uhura, whose name means freedom. ",SPOCK
"Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless  MCCOY: Spock, isn't it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality? I, for one, could use a good non-reconstituted meal.",SPOCK
You look marvellous. You haven't changed a bit. ,KIRK
"Well, you can see for yourself, he's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion. ",MCCOY
Ask Landru. He remembers. He knows and he watches. You are strange. Are you not of the Body? ,MCCOY
"Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well. ",SPOCK
What for? ,KIRK
Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man.,KIRK
"Satellite control, this is the Captain. Energise all satellites. ",KIRK
How long to the colony at our present speed? ,KIRK
"That is evidently their intention, Captain. ",SPOCK
You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in any way possible. We'll be back shortly. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are. ,KIRK
"I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way. ",SPOCK
You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking for you for four hours. ,MCCOY
"Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. ",KIRK
Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear section C4 and C5. ,SPOCK
Captain? ,SPOCK
Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time changed. The next interphase will occur here. ,SPOCK
Source? ,KIRK
"Report, sir. ",KIRK
What do you read so far? ,KIRK
One of us could go back to contact Mister Scott. ,SPOCK
"Do you smell that? A sweet odour like honey. It was years ago, on another planet. A thing with a an odour like that. ",KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. ",SPOCK
The whole galaxy controlled by your kind? ,KIRK
"Yes, Your Excellency. ",SPOCK
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, this is the captain. Get the Enterprise out of here.",KIRK
"Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need. ",KIRK
Just a minute. Let me get her on the rock. There you go. ,MCCOY
"I have tried, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer. ",KIRK
Captain Koloth is quite a marksman. ,SPOCK
"I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him.",MCCOY
"Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials. ",SPOCK
That's why you have no resistance? ,KIRK
"Of course. If we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time, there must be another ship closer to Beta Canopus. Kirk to Bridge. Get me Starfleet, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"But tell me, which do you prefer to have around? ",MCCOY
Of course you didn't. I told the Captain. ,MCCOY
"Accidents seldom have such system, Doctor McCoy. I believe we must consider the alternative possibility that the crew of this ship destroyed her themselves. ",SPOCK
Energise. ,SPOCK
You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him. ,KIRK
You are a Vulcan. What is the logical thing to do? ,SPOCK
"Do what they want, sir? ",KIRK
"Jim, Spock may be dying. ",MCCOY
I can't. I'm sorry. Our power is balanced for four. There's no guarantee that we'll make it with five. All could die. Scotty? ,KIRK
Agreed. Sterilite off. ,MCCOY
I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to decode. ,KIRK
"Well, that would be most unfortunate. Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port. ",KIRK
"You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition. ",KIRK
"Thank you for your concern. All in all, it's been rather restful.",KIRK
The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here. I wonder what alerted it the first time. ,KIRK
Which adds up to absolutely nothing. ,MCCOY
"That's pretty good. I got one for you. The rabbit was followed by a little blonde girl, right? ",KIRK
I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold. ,SPOCK
Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad.,SPOCK
He fell from the console top. ,KIRK
You must be mistaken. They both can't be true. ,KIRK

And we've had too much of yours. I'll never get me to stay here.,MCCOY
The Body is one. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the tricorder) What do you make of that?",KIRK
"Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura! Lieutenant! Lieutenant, are you all right? Lieutenant, answer me! Lieutenant! What's happening to Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, are you all right? ",KIRK
"Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mister Advisor. ",KIRK
Interesting. ,SPOCK
Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we could preserve and study this  (But the little puppets collapse and die. Smoke rises from the bodies.),SPOCK
Klingons. ,KIRK
"Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here. But do one or the other now. ",MCCOY
An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It measures completely Earth-like. ,SPOCK
"I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars. If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars. ",KIRK
We go together. ,SPOCK
What do they want from us? ,KIRK
"Kol-Tai. Doctor McCoy, do you remember him? ",KIRK
Binary sun with a Class M planet. That's rare enough to warrant investigation. ,SPOCK
"Yes, that's correct. ",KIRK
What have you learned about the aliens? ,KIRK
"Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level. ",MCCOY
Let's jump him. ,MCCOY
"In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner. ",KIRK
"If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and everything within a light year will be defenceless. ",KIRK
Bioscanners report. ,KIRK
Compensate. ,KIRK
"Revenge, Captain? ",SPOCK
I can't give you any guarantee. ,MCCOY
"Reading, Spock. ",KIRK
The debris is what's left of the Antares. ,SPOCK
And your name? ,KIRK
Mister Spock? ,KIRK
"The tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying. They behave as though nothing had gone wrong. They check out sound physically. There are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state. I have no answers, Jim. ",MCCOY
All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction.,KIRK
Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors. ,SPOCK
Why? Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics? ,KIRK
Prisoners? ,SPOCK
"Kirk to Spock, I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks. ",KIRK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
"Captain, there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice. ",SPOCK
"You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room. ",SPOCK
The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also regulate body growth. ,SPOCK
Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century. Moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons. ,SPOCK
What about the hostages? Talk. Talk. ,KIRK
Approximately two hundred and forty years. ,SPOCK
Not Captain Kirk. ,MCCOY
And this thing? (the temple) ,KIRK
"Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating. ",MCCOY
Are you ready? ,KIRK
Cut him off.,KIRK
Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space sector we're patrolling now. No alien problems.,KIRK
"What happened, Jim? ",MCCOY
This mission is not for casual observers. It could be hazardous. ,KIRK
"Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's alive. Maybe I can talk to it. ",KIRK
"Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.",KIRK
"The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain. ",SPOCK
There are casualties? ,KIRK
"This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.",SPOCK
Apparently they were exposed to a frightening geological disaster. Such hardship induces savagery and violence. ,SPOCK
This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment. ,KIRK
"Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans. ",SPOCK
"In the future, Commander Bem, you will leave the operation of the transporter to Mister Scott, or one of the regular transporter crew. ",KIRK
We'll do our best. Let's go. ,KIRK
May I? ,SPOCK
Completed. ,MCCOY
Antimatter seems our only possibility. ,KIRK
This is Mister Spock. ,SPOCK
Antibodies. Antibodies. (goes to desk monitor) Bridge. ,KIRK
What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it itself as a form of protection? ,KIRK
"I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu.",KIRK
"Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to down here. We might as well finish it. ",KIRK
"Captain, the water is too pure. ",SPOCK
That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered. ,KIRK
"It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar. ",SPOCK
"None as yet, sir. But sensors now indicate it is twice our size.",SPOCK
"I'm not aware of it, Captain. ",SPOCK
"He's dead, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Well, I think she's coming around now. ",MCCOY
In a pig's eye! ,MCCOY
Don't lose contact with each other like your ancestors. ,KIRK
"What's the use of being a doctor, anyway? We're only as good as our drugs and technology make us. Underneath all the tricks, I might as well be practising in the Middle Ages. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, give us maximum shielding. ",KIRK
Bones. What are you doing here? (their voices wake Tyree) Tyree.,KIRK
Out? ,KIRK
Very well. (runs the tape through his computer) ,SPOCK
He's an exact duplicate? ,KIRK
"Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. ",SPOCK
"The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease. ",SPOCK
Jim! ,SPOCK
"This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and await your reply. What is it, Mister Bailey?",KIRK
"Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no problems.",SPOCK
(flipping open the communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none. ",SPOCK
How long do you think this ship can take the pounding? I've got to get up there. ,KIRK
"But if necessary to avoid interspace war,  [Bridge]",KIRK
I guess not. ,KIRK
Correct it. ,KIRK
Apparently a life form which previous surveys have not recorded.,SPOCK
Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design. ,SPOCK
Then we can leave any time we want to. Tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become a fountain of youth.,KIRK
On what charge? ,KIRK
"No, not like this. ",MCCOY
You mean you're going to scan space for him? ,MCCOY
Perfectly all right. Can you get a fix on us.,KIRK
"Certainly. Our engineering officer  UHURA: Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two hours. ",KIRK
Why remove my crew? ,KIRK
"We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor, your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever finds this please get it to Starfleet Command. I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn. ,KIRK
Can you remember the layout of this place? The arsenal? ,KIRK
"(pushes a load of buttons) Enterprise, this is Spock. Force field has been eliminated. (turns main power back on again)",SPOCK
Not this one. Tell me. ,KIRK
"No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission. ",SPOCK
"Kirk out, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints. ,MCCOY
Enterprise. From Captain Kirk. Come in. ,KIRK
"Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right. We seem to have had a cave-in. ",KIRK
"Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)",SPOCK
"But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in the event we've overlooked any minor damage. ",SPOCK
"Nomad. Nomad? Stop. Nomad, stop! Nomad. ",KIRK
"Bones, how is he? ",KIRK
Hard about. ,KIRK
"Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic. ",SPOCK
You all right? ,KIRK
They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before. ,SPOCK
"All right, Korob. What do you want from us? ",KIRK
"Finally finished a physical on you, didn't I. (Kirk leaves) What am I, a doctor or a moon shuttle conductor? If I jumped every time a light came on around here, I'd end up talking to myself.",MCCOY
"That's, er. We'll figure it out later. ",KIRK
And if I don't? ,KIRK
"The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions. Where's Chekov? ",KIRK
But Spock will be dead. His body's dying this minute. ,KIRK
"He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates. ",KIRK
Stand by with full power. ,SPOCK
"Nancy, it's Leonard! ",MCCOY
And no one from the ship made such a call.,SPOCK
We hope to be finished long before that. ,KIRK
You can count on it. ,KIRK
I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship. I can't do much for them down here. ,MCCOY
"It looks like some kind of zoo. I don't recognise a lot of these species, Jim. ",MCCOY
He keeps blinking no.,KIRK
A disintegration machine. ,KIRK
"2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"(sitting down) Well, what do we do, just talk it over? ",KIRK
How old are you? How old are you? ,KIRK
"Yes, I'm fine.",KIRK
Then Spock's theory is right. We're contracting. ,KIRK
"Five weeks, three days, two hours and four minutes to be exact, Captain. ",SPOCK
"We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Joy to you all, friends. ",MCCOY
"And you and Mister Spock, Captain. ",MCCOY
"It is true then, Captain? ",SPOCK
Enterprise! Emergency! Beam up! ,MCCOY
"Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go? ",KIRK
"Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field. The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years. No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time. ",KIRK
"My mother. The son, what was his name and age when he died? ",SPOCK
"Under no circumstances allow them in here yet. The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through. ",KIRK
Then go to Red Alert. ,KIRK
Under dozens of petty dictatorships. ,SPOCK
Crude but dangerous. ,SPOCK
"These two are alive. Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know who I am? What's happened to you? ",KIRK
"Yes, Mister Rodriguez.",KIRK
"All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing off. ",KIRK
"I don't buy that, Bones. Guard! ",KIRK
"No, it's simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms. ",MCCOY
"All right, it's difficult. What's your point? ",KIRK
Who are you? Why did you bring us here? ,KIRK
I must destroy that ship completely. ,KIRK
"Doctor, I'll return to my station now. ",SPOCK
"He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two.",MCCOY
Where is the brain located? ,KIRK
Ben. ,KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"It's his job, and you know it. ",MCCOY
Attempting to remedy. ,SPOCK
"Riley, get back to the Sickbay. ",KIRK
"Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain? ",MCCOY
I'm not leaving without my men. ,KIRK
I have very little time. ,KIRK
Crater! ,KIRK
"Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your dressmaker. ",KIRK
"The power source we detected is in this building, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Unknown, Captain. However, Mister Sulu has computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as a base course.",SPOCK
Beam us up. ,KIRK
That thing can't die. ,MCCOY
Security guard. ,KIRK
"Doesn't give us much choice, does it. ",KIRK
They must be furious to follow us this deep into Federation territory. ,MCCOY
"You haven't told me. You haven't told me  RUTH: Do what you have to do, and I'll be waiting.",KIRK
Get off my ship. ,KIRK
Interesting that the villagers know about phasers. ,SPOCK
"I see him, Ensign. I see him. Now, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Grant looked up, saw a Klingon, made a purely instinctive defensive move. What's a Klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway? ",KIRK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
"Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed. ",SPOCK
"In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century ago. ",MCCOY
"If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l? ",KIRK
(shouting) Where? ,KIRK
"You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried it, huh? ",MCCOY
Where is it? ,KIRK
"In other words, we're going down to one sixteenth of an inch high. ",KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
What happened? ,KIRK
Did he order you to increase orbit? ,SPOCK
Call Mister Scott to the bridge. ,KIRK
"I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor. I am merely pursuing the only logical course available to us.",SPOCK
Bridge reports. ,KIRK
"I have my reasons, and I'll make them clear to you in my own good time. ",KIRK
We're blind here. What's it look like? ,KIRK
"If you're asking my approval  MULHALL: I require only your silence. Only you and I will know that Doctor Mulhall has not returned to her body. Isn't that worth your captain's life? Doctor, we can take what we wish. Neither you, this ship, nor worlds have the power to stop us. ",MCCOY
You'll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining yourself. ,KIRK
Nor upset? ,SPOCK
Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it! ,KIRK
Can you neutralise the gas? ,KIRK
I wish we hadn't had to do this. ,MCCOY
"Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? ",SPOCK
I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer. What am I supposed to do? I can't remember. I don't remember. ,MCCOY
There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you.,KIRK
Compliments of the house. To your good health and the health of the crew. ,MCCOY
"I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet. Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee? ",SPOCK
"Sulu. Sulu, our communications are being interfered with. (An explosion makes him run further on into an old bomb crater) Now get this straight. ",KIRK
"Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course be very crude. ",SPOCK
Take a look around you. ,KIRK
"It must be a malfunction. This is a barren world. There's hardly any vegetation, no apparent animal life. ",MCCOY
Energise. ,KIRK
I trusted you. ,KIRK
"Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have been thinking about my job. ",MCCOY
No. We come from a far place. We are men. ,KIRK
"Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Yes, it is. Very, very beautiful. ",KIRK
I have no choice. ,KIRK
Of course. ,MCCOY
"Who, me, Doctor? ",KIRK
"A thousand years, Captain?",SPOCK
"I've seen something very like it on Canopus Three, but that's light years from here. Still, this desert area is the same as on Canopus. ",KIRK
Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert.,KIRK
It is our mission. We must classify this planet. We have to test it. ,KIRK
Engineering. Scotty. This is the Bridge. ,KIRK
"Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot. ",SPOCK
But why Nazi Germany? You studied history. You knew what the Nazis were. ,KIRK
"It's no use, Jim. There's no way out. ",SPOCK
"Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is. ",SPOCK
"Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer. ",SPOCK
One man cannot summon the future. ,SPOCK
Scotty. ,KIRK
"I doubt that, Bones, but continue. ",KIRK
"Spock, come in. Come in. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon. ,KIRK
"Why, Doctor, you've been reading your textbooks again?",KIRK
"You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. (McCoy enters) But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you. ",KIRK
"May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?",SPOCK
"Yes, Captain, I am still here. Have you returned to the Enterprise? ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
I didn't think that for a moment. What else? ,KIRK
Who? ,KIRK
"This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite.",KIRK
Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering.,KIRK
"We have three. We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans.",KIRK
"Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? ",SPOCK
"Scotty, did you get that pilot? ",KIRK
"She's dead, Jim. Just like the other one. ",MCCOY
Bones! Shake him. Break his concentration. ,KIRK
That way. Spread out. Let's find it. ,KIRK
I didn't see it. ,KIRK
"Well, I had to see it to believe it. ",MCCOY
You conceal it very well. Mister Spock? ,KIRK
"It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment. ",SPOCK
"It has ceased fire. We're being held in a tractor beam. We're being pulled inside, Commodore. You must veer off. ",SPOCK
One. ,SPOCK
It appears we're all victims of a rather bizarre coincidence.,SPOCK
"We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four hundred degrees. Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees.",SPOCK
What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to you. ,KIRK
I'm already on maximum.,KIRK
"We're now headed for your new home. The planet Verdanis, ten days distant. ",KIRK
Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time. ,SPOCK
Who? ,KIRK
"Spock, can you rig a low-frequency shield like the one on the alien ship, on our navigation console? ",KIRK
What happened to your crew? ,KIRK
His name was at the top of the duty roster. ,KIRK
Are you suggesting that I did? ,KIRK
"Sir, we are accelerating. We are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness. ",SPOCK
There's something disquieting about these creatures. ,SPOCK
What about Tchar? How are you going to punish him? ,KIRK
"No. I need the help. In there, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the stuff on the end? It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times stronger. ",MCCOY
"We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself.",KIRK
I spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one.,KIRK
It was our last chance. ,KIRK
"Just a little while longer, Scotty. Report on the computer search. ",KIRK
"He needs it. You've got your problems, I've got mine. He's got ours, plus his, plus four hundred and thirty other people's. Where are you going?",MCCOY
Has Childress reported in yet? ,KIRK
"I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done. ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, beam me aboard. ",KIRK
"I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon. ",SPOCK
Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney. ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Nonsense. ,KIRK
It's not too late. Sheriff. Sheriff. There must be plenty of decent people in town who don't like the Earps. Let's organise them. ,KIRK
Stay with the controls. Keep our forward shields to him. ,KIRK
"A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir.",SPOCK
Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet. But why? ,KIRK
"Jim, I'm picking up a humanoid reading of incredible strength.",MCCOY
Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong? ,KIRK
"No, the one inside my head. How long have I  (Tries to sit up and fails.) ",KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
"Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety is vital to the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Another dream that failed. There's nothing sadder. It took these people a year to make the trip from Earth. They came all that way and died. ,KIRK
"Very well. (just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie.",SPOCK
"They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to. ",KIRK
Phasers on stun. Sweep the area. ,KIRK
"This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. ",SPOCK
"Without that mask, I haven't  VANNA: With your bare hands, Captain.",KIRK
"It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately, and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities. ",SPOCK
"No, sir. ",SPOCK
"It's pretty certain to be the brain, Jim. The functioning of the brain is basically electric. ",MCCOY
"Jim, you can't hand over the Enterprise. ",MCCOY
Then we're not home yet.,KIRK
"Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers. Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him? ",MCCOY
"Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions. ",KIRK
"Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life? ",KIRK
No. We'll probably take you to a Federation Starbase. ,KIRK
Out of the question. ,SPOCK
"Gem, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can be taught not to use his power  THASIAN: We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it, always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves. ",KIRK
I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you continue draining the phasers. ,SPOCK
The field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles. If the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out. ,SPOCK
"Kirk to Enterprise. Prepare to beam aboard two parties, all human. ",KIRK
"Getting another life reading, Captain.",SPOCK
And it can bear up under full phaser power. ,KIRK
Because it is not there. ,SPOCK
"Yes, Mister Sulu. Report. ",KIRK
The best thing we can do is Argh! ,KIRK
I don't need the ship for that. ,KIRK
"Yes, that's too bad. Why do you defy him? ",KIRK
"No, but you won't let that stop you.",MCCOY
"Wave bombardment reduced, but continuing. Deflector shields ineffective. ",SPOCK
"They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what? ",KIRK
"All the comforts of home indeed, Mister Cochrane. Where'd you get the antiques? ",KIRK
Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment. ,SPOCK
That cat. ,KIRK
"Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. ",KIRK
Or do you want to go through life looking like your First Officer? ,MCCOY
"Yes. To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece, creatures like that would have been gods. ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard. ,KIRK
"In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity. ",SPOCK
"There's still one chance. After that ship enters the nova, it should burn up and break contact with our tractor beam. Mister Spock, how long will we have to apply full braking power and execute course change? ",KIRK
You did what you could. ,KIRK
"I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him.",MCCOY
Yes. ,SPOCK
"Well, it seems my little demonstration was quite a success. ",KIRK
Your tour of duty will last one hour. Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings. Don't wait to investigate. ,KIRK
Heading directly toward us at warp speed. ,SPOCK
"And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the centre of the time disturbance. ",SPOCK
"Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us. Better in fact, because he's acclimated. ",MCCOY
"Not me, Mister Earp. ",KIRK
"I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a Starbase. ",SPOCK
"You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned. We find you out here, where no human has any business being. We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here.",KIRK
Better than warp seven. ,SPOCK
Let me see that arm. ,MCCOY
"If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that. ",KIRK
Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble. ,KIRK
"Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. ",KIRK
Could we make a communicator? ,KIRK
"Whatever it is, it moves like a cat. ",KIRK
What era? ,KIRK
Star readings? ,KIRK
How are you going to choose? ,KIRK
"Tell me, Doctor Jones. Why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock I can understand. Nothing makes an impression on him. ",KIRK
"Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger.",SPOCK
"Open hailing frequencies again, Lieutenant. Tell her she is endangering her life if she remains on her present course. ",KIRK
"I wish I knew. Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock? ",KIRK
What evidence do you have against Mister Jones? ,KIRK
"By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
Beam up the security detachment from Triacus. (no one appears),KIRK
She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger? ,KIRK
"My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my personal attention, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone? ,MCCOY
"I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart. Dismissed.",KIRK
Where do they keep the equipment? I could use my tricorder. ,SPOCK
He's got about one minute to live unless I can find an answer.,MCCOY
You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds. ,MCCOY
"Put them in the hut. Find out where the women are. Put them in there, too. ",KIRK
It's wounded. Badly. You've got to help it. ,KIRK
"Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records as simple fatigue.",MCCOY
"Vulcan, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Delay that order, Mister Sulu! ",KIRK
"We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and make repairs. ",SPOCK
"Chekov. Chekov. (picks him up) Is this what's in store for us, from here on in? Violence, hatred. ",KIRK
"It'll take four days to get the drug, but Spock will die in three. There's got to be a way. ",KIRK
"It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote. ",KIRK
"This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman. (he tests its hand movement.) It is ready, Thalassa. ",SPOCK
"Well, you can be hurt, can't you? We just sit here? It's your move. ",KIRK
Sulu!,MCCOY
"Open a channel, Uhura. ",KIRK
"Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us. ",SPOCK
What? ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters. It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel. What is your present location?",SPOCK
"That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory. ",SPOCK
Do you want a galactic war on your conscience? ,SPOCK
"Well, where do we start, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
I see your flower has blossomed again. ,KIRK
"No. No, I'm not. ",KIRK
"I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request  KOMACK [on monitor]: Altair Six is no ordinary matter. That area is just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict. This inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system. Our appearance there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the Klingon Empire. ",KIRK
Rayna. ,KIRK
"If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I must agree. ",SPOCK
"Good. Mind the store, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
I will bring them. ,KIRK
There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them. ,KIRK
That's not the way. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, sound Yellow Alert. ",KIRK
"I'll prepare the formula, Sargon. ",SPOCK
Release him. ,KIRK
"No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain. You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us. ",KIRK
"I'm perfectly aware of the dosage required. Now, you've got ten seconds before it takes effect. You'll be out less than five minutes. ",MCCOY
"Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist.",SPOCK
Spock! ,KIRK
"A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman?",KIRK
"I'm afraid we can't reveal everything we know, Mister Seven. ",KIRK
I've neutralised the heating elements. ,SPOCK
"I'm a surgeon already. If I could learn these techniques, I might be able to retain them. ",MCCOY
Of course. Of course. A child could do it. A child could do it.,MCCOY
"Get engineering, Uhura. ",KIRK
Oh yes? You want him to die. What did you do to him on the Bridge? Did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes? ,KIRK
"Scotty, stop all engines. ",KIRK
"Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? ",SPOCK
Your scientists induced these mutations? ,KIRK
"Relay it, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
She would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know. I respect her privacy. ,MCCOY
"We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of their communication devices. ",SPOCK
"Tyree, supposing you had to fight? What then? ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally, with anger? ",MCCOY
Who are you? ,KIRK
"I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons? ",KIRK
"You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you. ",SPOCK
The stars. ,SPOCK
"He's dead, Captain.",MCCOY
"Good luck, sir. ",SPOCK
"Pull out its plug, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Jim, the Enterprise broke free. ",MCCOY
How do you know so much? ,MCCOY
"Captain, Jim, please don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the transmission.",SPOCK
"You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you? ",KIRK
"Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams. ",SPOCK
Do you post sentries? Guards? ,KIRK
We're stronger with you than without you! ,KIRK
What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose? ,KIRK
What do you want? ,KIRK
"Somewhere down there is where the Others live. Scotty, see if you can find a way down. ",KIRK
Sulu! ,KIRK
"Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit.",SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water. Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it. ",SPOCK
Ship's defences? ,KIRK
"I can't even get at it. He'd be on me in a moment. (the woman is awake again) Keep talking, Spock. Don't let me doze off. ",KIRK
"On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based? ",SPOCK
"He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I don't have to repeat myself. ",KIRK
Would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and holding them there. ,KIRK
We'll all go. ,KIRK
"If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if what he's seeing is real or delusion SPOCK: It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives.",MCCOY
"Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late.",MCCOY
If you have the courage. ,KIRK
That should make a good specimen. ,KIRK
I can't beam you down without further proof one way or the other.,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
How bad is it? ,KIRK
"No. I would say approximately four hundred  MCCOY: Don't quote odds and don't give me anymore dispassionate logic, Mister Spock. Just keep looking for them. ",SPOCK
"It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore. ",KIRK
No a right cross. ,MCCOY
"Meadows and no meteor craters. The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally. ",MCCOY
Spock here.,SPOCK
"Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
I am Kir  KIRK: I am Kirok! I am  SPOCK: Spock! ,SPOCK
No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out? ,KIRK
If John Gill is the Fuhrer it would seem the logical approach. ,KIRK
I catch on quickly. ,KIRK
"Odd, Mister Spock. Very odd. Spock, you stay here with me.",KIRK
Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this? ,MCCOY
What have you done with Spock's brain? ,KIRK
"Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli Six. ",SPOCK
"Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command. ",SPOCK
"No. We beamed it out into open space, Scotty. Widest possible dispersion. ",KIRK
The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any other course of action. The Tholian ship had to be disabled. ,SPOCK
And very simple. ,MCCOY
I really want to know. ,KIRK
"Better and better, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Negative. It would make us appear too weak.,SPOCK
I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic. ,SPOCK
"The Vulcans are the last delegates we have to pick up. As soon as we get them aboard, we'll be able to relax. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, what can we expect to find on Lactra Seven? ",KIRK
What do you think you're doing?,KIRK
"I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not going to let him commit patricide. ",KIRK
Let's go. Energise.,KIRK
"People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris.",KIRK
"Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill everyone? ",KIRK
We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. ,KIRK
"Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians, Captain. It may work. It may not. ",SPOCK
"Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact  [Auxiliary control]",SPOCK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is. ",KIRK
"There are times, Mister Spock, when I think I should have been a librarian. ",KIRK
"I have a patient here with many questions, Captain. ",MCCOY
"But he wanted to, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will. ",MCCOY
What is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present position? ,KIRK
"If I sent you to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by. ",KIRK
"Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim? ",MCCOY
We'd be fools if we didn't know that. But we also have been using our minds and trying to learn to live in peace. ,MCCOY
"Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do you understand? ",SPOCK
"You heard correctly, Jim. These people killed each other. ",MCCOY
"Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
Why should you fear it? ,SPOCK
"(to Gem) Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this.",KIRK
Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance? ,MCCOY
You seem more like a boy.,KIRK
"Nothing has been proven yet, Spock. The DNA code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing. You'll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder. ",MCCOY
"Well, one of these can make a man a pretty big boss, you know. ",KIRK
How can you destroy others and not me? ,KIRK
We can help you aboard the ship. ,KIRK
"Engage, warp factor one.",KIRK
Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit. ,KIRK
"You're probably right, Doctor. By the way, I don't like how you've been running this ship lately. ",MCCOY
Kiss. ,KIRK
"Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished? ",MCCOY
I don't understand. ,KIRK
"Nomad, I made an error in creating you. ",KIRK
"You've met her before, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Cut, Captain. ",SPOCK
"No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending.",SPOCK
On the contrary. I commend his action. ,KIRK
"Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No treaties have ever been signed. Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured. There are no extradition procedures to allow it. Is that clear, Commissioner Bele? ",KIRK
What are you talking about? Where have they taken Spock? ,KIRK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
I don't know. Any more like that and they'll tear this planet apart. ,KIRK
I never say that.,MCCOY
We'll need somebody in the pod for readings. ,KIRK
By the alien ship?,KIRK
"They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent. ",SPOCK
Have you tried an escape? ,KIRK
"Steady as she goes, Mister Hanson. ",KIRK
"Captain, fight it. Fight it as hard as you can. They think too fast in too complex a manner. If he gives up for even one moment, he may go mad. ",SPOCK
"Gentlemen, I'm sure there has been a mistake. (hands on shoulders) Where are you supposed to be working? ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, did you see what I think I just saw? ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"It is quite possible, Captain, that they find us grotesque and ugly. And many people fear beings different from themselves. ",SPOCK
Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go. ,KIRK
"I want full power, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock, and that is also something new for you. ",MCCOY
"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking. ",KIRK
Keep scanning. ,KIRK
"Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human? ",KIRK
Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge. ,KIRK
Where else would I be? ,MCCOY
"That is illogical, Ensign. Odours cannot travel through the vacuum of space. ",SPOCK
"McCoy'll be along in a few days, perhaps sooner. There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together. This has to work. ",KIRK
Let's go. (McCoy and Bailey leave) ,MCCOY
"And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled. ",KIRK
I gambled on his humanity. ,KIRK
"Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. Go ahead. ,KIRK
We'll do what we can. ,KIRK
"Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year. ",SPOCK
"Did it maintain, Scotty? ",KIRK
None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost appears intermittently. ,SPOCK
For what purpose have you imprisoned us here? ,KIRK
"Has a kind of a ring to it, don't you think, James? ",MCCOY
"See to her, Doctor. ",KIRK
Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? ,KIRK
Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is seeking revenge? ,SPOCK
I don't understand. This should have been attended to immediately. ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, let's hear that tape backward, which should sound forward to us. ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"Spock, Sarek how are they? ",KIRK
"Yes, what is it? ",KIRK
I don't think so. Scotty. ,KIRK
Fire. (several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire.,SPOCK
"Life science bioscanners are picking up heart beats from over there. Can't be human, though. They're too faint, and average only four beats per minute. ",MCCOY
"But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not. ",MCCOY
"Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you. Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die. ",MCCOY
"I'm on deck five, near my quarters. I've been attacked by an Andorian. Security. Security team. ",KIRK
"Yes. I never get involved with older women, Yeoman. Mister Spock?",KIRK
"If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all. ",SPOCK
"How's it going, Scotty? ",KIRK
And you also know that nothing is proven. ,KIRK
The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field. ,SPOCK
"Oh, Harry. I do believe you're putting on weight. ",KIRK
"Look, Jim. I know what it means to you to lose a crewman. ",MCCOY
Power surge? ,SPOCK
"Yes, she was all that. And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference. She was of great value. ",KIRK
"Direct hit, Captain. Damage to the secondary propulsion system.",SPOCK
Sorry. We don't want to hurt anyone. ,KIRK
Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down there. ,SPOCK
How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right to hand out life and death? ,KIRK
And it explains the murdered men. ,SPOCK
"Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie. ",MCCOY
Then we've got to get those men up. ,KIRK
Took the ship out of warp speed. ,KIRK
No change. ,KIRK
"No references to space, or the fact that there are other worlds, or more advanced civilisations. ",MCCOY
"I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in Engineering. ",SPOCK
"And you, Stiles? ",KIRK
"Vaal, we are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or your people. ",KIRK
To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical. ,SPOCK
Agreed.,SPOCK
"Doesn't seem likely, does it? ",KIRK
"All right, Compton. ",KIRK
And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to Doctor McCoy. ,KIRK
"I have a question for the doctor. (Kirk leaves) Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees, which is at least tolerable. However, I  MCCOY: Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you. ",SPOCK
"Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I will.",KIRK
We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Atoz. ",SPOCK
We're all right. ,KIRK
I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer. ,KIRK
Xenopolycythemia. It has no cure. ,MCCOY
Simple but effective. ,MCCOY
"Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation system. See what effect that has. ",KIRK
"If you're not in command, who is? ",KIRK
"We're stumped, Jim. The hormone seems to be the major factor in your mutation, but we just can't identify it. ",MCCOY
"Mister Scott, Lieutenant Uhura, come with me. Mister Sulu, you have the conn. We're beaming over. ",KIRK
"Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well? (takes a cup from her tray) My recommendation? Make them take the next step. ",KIRK
That ought to hold him for about six hours. ,MCCOY
He may indeed be dead. We do not know. ,SPOCK
(dazed and confused) Where am I? What place is this? What are these? (phaser and communicator) I feel should know. They're familiar and yet unfamiliar. How did I get here? Who am I? Try to remember. ,KIRK
"Yes, Jim. ",MCCOY
"He's in Sickbay. Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise, you're bound by its regulations. ",KIRK
How's that? ,MCCOY
"What do you mean, Spock? ",MCCOY
We can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look. ,KIRK
A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much. ,SPOCK
"Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly. Their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average. ",MCCOY
"All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet. ",KIRK
Very well. ,KIRK
We move on. ,KIRK
But children become adults. ,SPOCK
The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be landing there. ,KIRK
"It's burned. All this plant life is full of acid. Even the grass, Jim. ",MCCOY
Three against one? Those are pretty high odds. ,KIRK
I'm trying not to. ,KIRK
"They're studying us, for the moment. ",SPOCK
Why a cat? ,KIRK
Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory. ,KIRK
"Begging your pardon, Captain, I think we should face the situation realistically. We are specimen animals in a zoo. And they have taken every precaution to prevent our escape. To them we are caged for life. We seem to be drawing quite a crowd. ",SPOCK
Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand mechanics. ,SPOCK
What form of radiation was it? ,MCCOY
Lock in on McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here. ,KIRK
Half speed. Prepare for evasive action.,KIRK
All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for. ,MCCOY
"The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere. ",KIRK
A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo. ,SPOCK
It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature must still be around. ,KIRK
I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.,KIRK
The translator is for use with more congruent life forms. ,SPOCK
"None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary. ",SPOCK
"Anything on communications, Lieutenant Uhura? ",KIRK
"I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a fascinating project. ",SPOCK
"Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers. Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress call. ",SPOCK
Lieutenant. Sulu. This is nothing? ,KIRK
He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the base. It was necessary to bring him along. ,SPOCK
Elaan? ,KIRK
Position.,KIRK
"At our present rate of consumption, we'll exhaust our impulse power long before then. ",SPOCK
"Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions. ",SPOCK
"We're simply strangers from  NONA: From one of the lights in the sky, and you have ways as far above firesticks as the sky above our world. ",KIRK
"Verified, Captain. We have seven days.",SPOCK
Force field? ,KIRK
Agreed. ,SPOCK
"The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours. ",SPOCK
Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history. ,MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, take us back to the space station. Ahead, warp factor two.  ",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"All right, Mister Spock, work quietly. ",KIRK
Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to one. ,SPOCK
"He tried to escape. I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows. ",KIRK
"Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out. ",KIRK
"Welcome home, Jim.",MCCOY
Not bad. ,SPOCK
"Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't.",SPOCK
"Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty, are there not? ",SPOCK
"I quite understand, Captain. ",SPOCK
Yes. It's possible. ,MCCOY
"Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be watched. We're moving out. Formation L. ",KIRK
No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No! ,SPOCK
"Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding? ",MCCOY
"Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it.",SPOCK
"It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered having it removed?",SPOCK
Phasers on stun! ,KIRK
"In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate. Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency. ",MCCOY
"Twelve hours, Captain? That is unprecedented. ",SPOCK
Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.,MCCOY
"First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment? ",KIRK
Good! I couldn't face going through there again. ,KIRK
You've been told everything. There's nothing else to say. ,KIRK
When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their weapon. SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the intruder. ,KIRK
"Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer. ",SPOCK
We must get her into the pressure chamber. ,KIRK
"Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about? ",KIRK
What's that?,KIRK
Captain Kirk! ,SPOCK
And that is the only thing that has saved us until now. ,SPOCK
"It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me. (the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor) It wants this ship, but I am resisting. ",SPOCK
"What is your point, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"All right, it's worked so far, but we're not out yet. ",MCCOY
"Mischievous pranks, Captain? ",SPOCK
That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius. ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, please answer the question. ",SPOCK
"If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference. It won't know more than it does now. ",KIRK
I'll obey. Let him go. ,KIRK
That's what the computers will tell us. ,MCCOY
"Of the planet Cheron, no doubt. ",KIRK
Where have you been? What happened?,KIRK
I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely.,SPOCK
Take the helm!,KIRK
"He's under a lot of pressure, Bones. ",KIRK
"Your report, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron. Spock was shot with a flintlock. How many centuries between those two developments? ",KIRK
Is there a path down there? ,KIRK
"If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. ",SPOCK
Why not? ,KIRK
For how long? ,KIRK
"Captain, perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien intelligence and reason with it. ",SPOCK
I can see the Captain is going to be difficult. ,SPOCK
"Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree. ",MCCOY
"Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out? ",KIRK
I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place. ,MCCOY
Activate shields. ,KIRK
Why are they so sure I can help them? ,KIRK
She likes him. Mister Chekov. The floor is no place for an officer. Attention! Now stand absolutely still. ,KIRK
An underground? How are you organised? ,SPOCK
An entire attack force against my ship? ,KIRK
"I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm. ",KIRK
No. That'd start the final battle. I believe her. Prepare the transporter. We'll wait for your signal. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel. ",KIRK
"Next tape, please.",SPOCK
Good. ,KIRK
"Energise main phasers, Mister Styles. All weapons to full power. ",KIRK
"Governor Cory, how do you feel? ",KIRK
"But no one being, not even you, has the right to interfere with other cultures. ",KIRK
Evasive action. ,KIRK
Beam me aboard. ,KIRK
"All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you? ",KIRK
Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct approach? ,SPOCK
"Matt. Matt, listen to me. You can't throw your life away like this. Matt, you're a starship commander. That makes you a valuable commodity. ",KIRK
"There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which requires our presence. ",MCCOY
Stunned but coming around. I'm not sure it's wise to let her go off like that. ,MCCOY
Maybe it's a shield of some kind. Some form of protection for something else. ,KIRK

Read out official record of current command. ,KIRK
"Yes, I feel it too, Bones. ",KIRK
Shift positions. ,KIRK
This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly? ,MCCOY
"Yes, quite all right, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Yes, that's right. That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened. We can change it. Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming? ",KIRK
No! Wait! ,KIRK
"He's coming out of it, Jim. He's becoming conscious and aware. ",MCCOY
It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer. ,SPOCK
Wait. Listen. ,KIRK
"Now, now, Mister Spock, you're not trying to scare our Dramian friend, are you? Of course, you can back out if you'd like, Commander. ",KIRK
Controls are fused. Drop! ,KIRK
Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can do anything to stop them. ,KIRK
"Radiation passing the tolerance level, entering lethal zone.",SPOCK
All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out the battery connections) Again! Again! ,SPOCK
"What's its mass, Mister Spock?",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Spock. Dead. And you'll find every red corpuscle gone from their body. ,KIRK
"No, no particular person, just people in general. Where did they go? ",MCCOY
Not everything. ,KIRK
"Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you? ",MCCOY
"I was looking at him. I was looking right at him, and then he just wasn't there  RAEL [on viewer]: Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what's happening to us. (Spock slows down the playback, then speeds it up) Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area. We have no explanation for what's happening to us. Nation of nine hundred thousand. City alone holding one hundred thirteen thousand. On which existed several culturally enlightened Indigenous population  (Finally it is speeded up to the familiar buzz or whine the crew have been hearing.) ",MCCOY
"On one condition, Prefect. That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on. ",KIRK
What happened? Fill me in. ,KIRK
This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five minutes. ,KIRK
Jim! ,MCCOY
Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain. ,SPOCK
By what? Are you happy here with Flint? ,KIRK
It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship. ,SPOCK
"Who, then? ",KIRK
Good. Let's see how long he can do it. ,KIRK
Kirk out. ,KIRK
"An alien life force. We must make contact, find out what it wants. ",KIRK
Come. ,KIRK
"No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure. ",MCCOY
Yes. Anan Seven. ,KIRK
As though he's keeping us here for some reason. ,KIRK
I read no evidence of malfunction. ,SPOCK
Explain. ,KIRK
Phasers on heavy stun. Energise.,KIRK
"Admiral, the crew will not understand it. ",SPOCK
What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish? ,SPOCK
Captain Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart. ",MCCOY
"I did give a full report  KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, that was the past. I'm concerned with the present. Or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current information? ",SPOCK
Don't get dressed yet. ,MCCOY
I'd like to examine the body. ,MCCOY
"The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman? ",SPOCK
"Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as these people do, to protect themselves. ",SPOCK
"Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless. ",KIRK
You mean they're actually draining our life forces? ,KIRK
"Bones, I can't understand why a simple cut like that could become so serious. ",KIRK
That helmet covers a multitude of sins. ,KIRK
"Position, Mister Scott? ",SPOCK
Hold your position. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force. ",KIRK
"I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer. ",SPOCK
(with echoy Sargon voice) The transference is complete. ,KIRK
Press the three lower planets on the left-hand side simultaneously. ,MCCOY
I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred. ,KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
(on biobed) It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me.,SPOCK
I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me. ,SPOCK
Let her rant. There's nothing to say. ,KIRK
Where is Doctor Korby? ,KIRK
Mister Spock? ,KIRK
The Federation has handled foreign invasions before. ,KIRK
"Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination. ",MCCOY
"This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you. ",KIRK
"I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable. ",SPOCK
"Kirk here. Enterprise standing by, Commodore. ",KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your problem to the Federation. Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization. ",KIRK
"Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder.",MCCOY
That is my concern. ,SPOCK
I've never heard that language before. ,KIRK
He'll live. ,MCCOY
A civilisation that advanced three hundred million years ago before life even emerged on Earth. ,KIRK
"Temperature, Captain. First sign. ",MCCOY
"I know this is just my imagination but  LUCIEN: It is real, Doctor. Beautiful? No. But all our women are as young and beautiful as they want to be. So as to ensnare the man of her dreams, she needs an edge. ",MCCOY
"It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric. ",SPOCK
You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer. ,KIRK
That suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies. ,SPOCK
"This system's star is a trinary. Limits it a bit, but we're a long way from the Enterprise, if we're in the same dimension. ",KIRK
"I didn't start it, Councilman, but I'm liable to finish it. ",KIRK
"Yes, I know.",KIRK
He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you. But there's more medicine aboard the ship. ,KIRK
"I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie. ",KIRK
Bridge to transporter room. Captain Christopher. ,KIRK
Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber. ,KIRK
"Nevertheless, we're still in business and I propose a toast to a narrow escape. ",MCCOY
"Closing, Captain. ",SPOCK
"In a manner of speaking, yes. We control it. It sustains us. ",KIRK
"If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us. ",SPOCK
He's as stubborn as ever. (laughs)  ,MCCOY
This is Kirk. ,SPOCK
"Spock, didn't you hear? I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world. Jim, isn't it worth that risk? Wouldn't you insist upon taking such a risk yourself? ",MCCOY
(removing a piece of plant from Darnell's mouth) McCoy. ,KIRK
"Jim will do here, Janice. ",KIRK
That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival. ,SPOCK
She evidently understood something. There are no guards to detain us.,SPOCK
Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything. ,MCCOY
Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman. ,KIRK
"I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit.",SPOCK
It's worth a try. (into communicator) Kirk to alien intelligence.,KIRK
"Captain, they have concluded they cannot break through your mind on a one to one basis. They are now gathering the mental strength of all five of them to break through. ",SPOCK
Address intercraft. ,SPOCK
Perfect working condition. ,SPOCK
Keep me together for another seven minutes. That's all I need. ,KIRK
"Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured! ",KIRK
Mister Lincoln! ,KIRK
"Someone or something has succeeded. Our distress signal relays have been activated. We've been given a direction to follow, but how?",KIRK
Throw the switch. ,KIRK
"Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?,MCCOY
"Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command. ",SPOCK
"Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds? ",KIRK
Most people are afraid of being alone. ,KIRK
The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone along with what and who you think you are. ,KIRK
"It troubles you, Cochrane? ",KIRK
But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules? ,KIRK
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They didn't report this culture in this state, either. What happened? ",KIRK
This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.,SPOCK
Everyone ready to transport? ,KIRK
"I am moving slowly now, establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus. ",SPOCK
And you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock? ,KIRK
"You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they  SCOTT: Well, sir, this was a matter of pride. ",KIRK
Until what is over? ,KIRK
"I'm Captain Kirk. First of all, I must protest the killing of my crewman. ",KIRK
Try again.,KIRK
Certainly. ,KIRK
"Engineering, maintain full power. Full power. ",SPOCK
I'm sure you won't mind if I ignore your advice. ,KIRK
Source of power? ,KIRK
"When I was a cadet at the Academy, his exploits were required reading. He was one of my heroes. I'd like to see him. ",KIRK
"Position report, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce.",SPOCK
"Doc, I don't want to hurt you. ",KIRK
That's impossible. ,KIRK
"Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them. ",SPOCK
"Negative, Captain. Its hull is pure neutronium. There is no known way of blasting through it. ",SPOCK
It's crucial. ,MCCOY
"And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim. ",SPOCK
"Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us. ",KIRK
"Seven hours and eight minutes, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Something, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.",SPOCK
How's she doing? ,MCCOY
"We are not Archons, Marplon. ",SPOCK
The fifth setting seems to be an energy absorber. Fascinating. I had no idea the Slavers had such things. ,SPOCK
Do you know whether he saw the Medusan? ,SPOCK
"No, no! Don't shoot. Come on over, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Gives me the creeps. I feel like something's watching us. ,MCCOY
"If you'll permit me, Captain, I might be able to get McCoy. ",SPOCK
Neither have I. ,KIRK
How will you find Spock? ,MCCOY
"I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can be controlled. ",SPOCK
"Most mythology has its basis in fact. If I remember my ancient legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we humans. ",KIRK
You saw how treacherously they acted. ,KIRK
Strange. ,SPOCK
"Spock, (he turns green) you're sure? ",KIRK
I'm paralysed. ,KIRK
Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet. ,MCCOY
Reverse full power. ,KIRK
"Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this. ",SPOCK
Request denied. ,KIRK
And it's nice to know the lady is as intelligent as she is beautiful. Much like the flower she carries. ,MCCOY
"Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty. ",SPOCK
Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations. ,KIRK
But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet? ,KIRK
Spock. Bones. ,KIRK
Let's find the others. I feel a need for human companionship. ,KIRK
Footprints. Could be a rabbit. It would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks. What about Mister Sulu? Will he confirm what you saw?,KIRK
By whom? ,KIRK
"I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp. My name is not Clanton, it's Kirk. ",KIRK
Activate deflectors. ,SPOCK
Are you refusing a direct order? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk.",KIRK
"No, no, no. I promise you. ",KIRK
"Not very likely, Ensign. ",SPOCK
"Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all. ",SPOCK
"Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man  KIRK: Doctor Sevrin is their leader? ",SPOCK
"I'm a doctor, Spock, a doctor. Get us beamed aboard. ",MCCOY
You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of them around? ,MCCOY
"Something odd, Captain. You said two people. ",SPOCK
A natural phenomenon. But what? Duty personnel on Yellow Alert.,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"In here, Captain. (at door to main room) ",SPOCK
"My apologies, Mister Spock. You suspect some danger in them? ",KIRK
They've been in flight ten thousand years. Maybe they don't realise it. ,KIRK
Okay. ,KIRK
"It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him. ",MCCOY
Any interference? Resistance?,KIRK
That's the way it was in 1881. ,KIRK
Miranda! ,KIRK
Anything? ,KIRK
"It is not outside the realm of probability. If he could rearrange his own atoms to become an examination table, one would have to assume he could become a deflector shield. ",SPOCK
"All right, Mister Lesley, let's get out of here. Ahead warp factor one. ",KIRK
"You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles. ",KIRK
Did you see your father today? ,KIRK
"Why, thank you, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Good, go ahead. ",KIRK
I most certainly do. Energise. ,KIRK
"It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna.",KIRK
"I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative.",SPOCK
"Precisely, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Not a very welcome sight, is it? ",MCCOY
"Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep. ",KIRK
Mister Sulu try rocking the ship. Full impulse power forward and back. ,KIRK
Impossible. He too is stricken. ,SPOCK
Red alert! Red alert! ,SPOCK
"This is how you observe, by being captured? ",SPOCK
"Spock, find the radio station. Uhura's monitoring the broadcasts.",KIRK
"Hey, Bela, no, no, no. The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this. No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss. Krako, you'd be his lieutenant. The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation. We'll be back every year to collect our cut. ",KIRK
How? ,KIRK
"We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel. We'll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers. All decks, stand by. ",KIRK
That's Spock! ,MCCOY
"Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it. ",KIRK
Shut up. We're rescuing you. ,KIRK
Sickbay with a headache.,KIRK
"I'm sorry, Commodore, Mrs. April. It looks as though we may not reach Babel. ",KIRK
"Confirmed, sir. ",SPOCK
"Bones, you did it! ",KIRK
"Not with my ship, you don't. ",KIRK
Indeed? ,SPOCK
I just realised that. ,SPOCK
"Orion's neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair regarding the Coridan planets and the Babel Conference of stardate 3850.3. Yesterday, a Federation freighter was attacked in this quadrant, its cargo hijacked. As the first alien ship encountered, we require you to submit to search, as per Babel Resolution A12. Reply. ",KIRK
(in a monotone) You offer us only well-being. ,MCCOY
"Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe. ",SPOCK
It refers to the altar. Apply pressure to the centre until it opens. ,SPOCK
"Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in!",KIRK
Miss Chapel. ,MCCOY
Starfleet force is used only as a last resort. We're an instrument of civilisation. And it's a better opportunity for a scientist to study the universe than he can get at the Vulcan Science Academy. ,KIRK
No chance of restoring warp drive? ,KIRK
"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the substance. ",SPOCK
Bearing one one seven mark four. ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine? ",KIRK
"Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go on! ",KIRK
"Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you. ",SPOCK
Bones. ,KIRK
"That's all, Spock. Dismissed. ",KIRK
It can be done. ,SPOCK
"But it may be just what we need to shake the Romulans. Batten down, we're going through. ",KIRK
And you're on the edge of insubordination. ,KIRK
"Stabbed, a dozen times. ",KIRK
What the devil's going on? ,MCCOY
Put it on audio. ,KIRK
It's a waste of time if you ask me. ,MCCOY
"Commodore, I suggest  DECKER: Kirk pulled us out of there by distracting it. Now it's our turn. Fire phasers. (they do) We did it! Hard about. Give me some distance. ",SPOCK
A safe tribble would be a contradiction in terms. Tribbles are well known for their proclivities in multiplication. ,SPOCK
Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power. ,SPOCK
That's quite a difference. ,KIRK
What is it?,KIRK
"I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise term. Induced by an outside force. ",SPOCK
"I wasn't that bad, was I? ",KIRK
"I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition. ",SPOCK
Is that what you want to do? ,KIRK
Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him? ,KIRK
Who are you? ,KIRK
"Now then, Mister Hengist  (But Hengist tries to make a break for it, even landing a very good kick on Kirk, who repays him with an even better right cross. Hengist falls to the floor.) ",KIRK
You left us. The room became lonely. ,KIRK
But why? ,MCCOY
That's the primitive glaciated planet. ,KIRK
"Is that for us, or does it need fresh air? ",KIRK
"Improbable, Captain. The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead. The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life. ",SPOCK
I'm asking what you know about ESP. ,KIRK
"Identical. Earth, as it was in the early 1900s. ",KIRK
Still undistinguishable. ,SPOCK
"Fire those phasers! That's an order, Mister Spock! ",KIRK
"That would be illogical, Miss Chapel. ",SPOCK
What hit? What attacked you? ,KIRK
Then why didn't you warn us? ,MCCOY
"The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate. ",SPOCK
The Klingons? ,SPOCK
"Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die? ",SPOCK
"Mousetrapped. If the first ship doesn't succeed in blasting us out of existence, they have two backup ships to do the job. ",KIRK
"Er, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
"Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long time, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"I'm not sure, but I think  (A screen comes to life with a face on it) ",KIRK
I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances being introduced. ,SPOCK
Totally illogical. There was no chance. ,SPOCK
You have something to report? ,KIRK
"All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally. ",SPOCK
Lieutenant! ,KIRK
Spock. What happened? ,KIRK
"I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock.",KIRK
"Tactically well planned. When the Federation investigates, we'll be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance. ",SPOCK
How long will it take you to reach this new world? ,MCCOY
"Well, no. ",MCCOY
"In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott.",SPOCK
"Why, Doctor? ",SPOCK
I call them ears. ,SPOCK
"Doctor Coleman, if you're required here, we'll call you. ",KIRK
"What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had. No. The only solution is what happened back then. Balance of power. ",KIRK
"The records of the Enterprise are open for your inspection. All the history of Earth and the Federation is at your disposal. Look, look at General Order number One. No starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society. Compare that with the Earth you once knew. ",KIRK
"There's something wrong, Jim. Their nervous systems. Unconscious like this, there should be just routine autonomic activity, but I'm getting a very high reading, as though even in their unconscious state, they're being violently stimulated. ",MCCOY
You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you understand the nature of it? ,KIRK
Then get back to Sickbay! ,KIRK
Perhaps they haven't had enough time to recharge it. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature. ",SPOCK
"Captain, these are crude crystals. There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow. ",SPOCK
"Crewman, stand aside.",SPOCK
"Companion, do you love the man? ",KIRK
"Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink. ",MCCOY
Ruth? Ruth.,KIRK
"Well, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course.",KIRK
"Companion, try to understand. It is the nature of our species to be free, just as it is your nature to stay here. We will cease to exist in captivity. ",KIRK
"It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself? ,KIRK
Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes. ,SPOCK
"Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. (moves away from the group) Yes, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Live long and prosper, Mister Seven. ",SPOCK
"Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way. ",KIRK
Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life. ,SPOCK
"We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here. ",KIRK
"Jim, he's not responsible. ",SPOCK
Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.,SPOCK
"They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death. ",KIRK
"Undetermined. Whatever it is, it's blocking our way. When we move, it moves as well.",SPOCK
Jim. Spock. What in the name of sanity is going on? ,MCCOY
"Draw it? I demand it. And right now, Commodore Stone. Right now.",KIRK
"Well, speculation isn't much help. We have to get in there. ",KIRK
"Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high ground. (fizzing sound and smoke) They've locked on to my tricorder. ",SPOCK
Over there! ,KIRK
I'm in control of my emotions.,SPOCK
"Easy, Bailey.",MCCOY
"Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock? ",KIRK
But am I hallucinating? ,KIRK
Must have been some insult. ,KIRK
"Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer. ",KIRK
"We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can cross-circuit this unit. ",SPOCK
A philosophy of total love and total brotherhood. ,MCCOY
You sent your own men into the arena? ,KIRK
"No, it doesn't. ",KIRK
I may have found our focal point in time. ,SPOCK
They're trying to contact us directly. I can make out something.,SPOCK
Report. ,KIRK
You just rest. ,MCCOY
"Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous novelist will write a classic using that theme. He'll recommend those three words even over I love you. ",KIRK

All right. Put them on. ,KIRK

Ambassador. ,MCCOY
"The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is a concentration of kironide, broken down by pituitary hormone. ",MCCOY

"Your deflector shield, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
A vessel of some kind?,KIRK
"No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it. ",KIRK
"Faked. All this happened several days ago. (to a man in a yellow shirt) Lang, over there. Look for survivors. Kelowitz, (blue shirt)",KIRK
"It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel. ",SPOCK
"Repeat, the ship is on Red Alert. There has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship's directional control.",KIRK
"Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated. ",KIRK

Could it cure her? ,KIRK
You have what you wanted most. ,MCCOY

"Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
"Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong. ",KIRK
"Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own. I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it. ",MCCOY
Jim. ,MCCOY
Get out of here! Hurry! ,KIRK
"Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year. ",MCCOY
"One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support systems functioning. Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen.",SPOCK
"Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour particles. ",SPOCK
"How does that sound to you, Keniclius? To bring life is at least as important as bringing peace. ",KIRK
"Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment. ",SPOCK
"Magnification factor twelve, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"Indeed, Captain. ",SPOCK
"A calculated risk, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die. ",SPOCK
You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet. ,MCCOY
"Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident, setting off a nuclear holocaust. ",SPOCK
Foolie? ,MCCOY
"Bows and arrows, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Kirk to Doctor McCoy. I'm recording you this message, Bones, so there will be no misunderstanding. I'm sorry to have to make it an order. You're not to disturb Captain Pike with any questions. Simply take good care of him. Follow Spock's instructions to the letter. Kirk out. (flash, flash) ",KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor. ",SPOCK
"Kang, do you read me? ",KIRK
"Yes, but later. Let's not spoil their fun just yet. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, have those transporter circuits checked. ",KIRK
They hooked something into the life support system. They're in there. We've got to get rid of it. ,KIRK
"If the alien is creating these events, Captain, it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind. ",SPOCK
"You have my sworn deposition._ STONE: Then, Captain, I must presume you've committed willful perjury.",KIRK
"If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know who on board the Enterprise is receiving.",KIRK
Scotty! Where are the tribbles? ,KIRK
Let's try. (a gentle but lingering kiss) See? No change.,KIRK
"It will not be long now, old friend. ",SPOCK
"I'm Captain  THANN: We are aware of your identity, Captain. ",KIRK
Then it's agreed. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Thanks, Spock. ",KIRK
I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to see that report. ,SPOCK
Yes. ,KIRK
"After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface. That will give us a complete record. Will that satisfy you, Mister Hengist? ",KIRK
"Yes. Yes, they are. ",MCCOY
"Assuming we get out of this, Captain KIRK: Nobody's given up yet.",MCCOY
Miramanee! ,KIRK
"Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you. ",SPOCK
"Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh?",SPOCK
"Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary.",SPOCK
"No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this. ",SPOCK
No. But we would welcome friends. ,KIRK
"I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good doctor's hypo. ",SPOCK
Jim! ,MCCOY
"It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men. I assume they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here. ",SPOCK
All crew personnel report to Transporter rooms immediately.,KIRK
No. No. It must be here someplace. ,KIRK
But they are not allowed to share its advantages. ,SPOCK
Sulu!,KIRK
"Enterprise to Korby. We have your co-ordinates pin-pointed. We're preparing to beam down a party. It may interest you that we have aboard this vessel  KORBY [OC]: I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam down alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries of such a nature they may require an extraordinary decision from you. ",KIRK
"Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins? Carstairs is an ensign, no experience. This is his first tour of duty. Rawlins is chief geologist.",KIRK
"There is indeed, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Joy be yours, and tranquillity, my friend. ",KIRK
"Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself. ",KIRK
The delay may be deliberate. ,SPOCK
"We have discovered what he is, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer. ",SPOCK
You filthy liar! ,KIRK
"An extraordinary phenomenon, Captain. ",SPOCK
Nothing? ,KIRK
"Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There will be no cross-discussion. When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny. The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision. ",KIRK
You can't think a man to death. ,KIRK
Understood. ,SPOCK
Not if we join together to fight you. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Kill it. ,SPOCK
"Get to the point, Spock. ",MCCOY
Yours. ,MCCOY
I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your posts. Go to your posts. ,KIRK
Not at this interphase. ,SPOCK
"But he didn't kill, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Bridge, this is the Captain.",KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"Yes, that's clear. ",KIRK
"Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant.",KIRK
Illogical. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert. ",SPOCK
Very good. ,SPOCK
"Mister Spock is, er, under arrest. Is confinement to quarters enough?",MCCOY
Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm. Correlate following hypothesis. Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits creating a momentary interdimensional contact with a parallel universe? ,KIRK
"Just the facts, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Yes.,SPOCK
He doesn't know about trick or treat. ,MCCOY
Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant? ,KIRK
"Ready, Captain. ",SPOCK
It's the Bible. ,MCCOY
A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now. ,SPOCK
"So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's.",KIRK
I'll see what we can do. ,KIRK
I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control? ,KIRK
"Come on, Spock. Where's that Vulcan sense of humour? ",KIRK
Cool off. ,KIRK
"We're as happy about it as you are, Jim. I'd just like to make one request. ",MCCOY
"Don't ask any questions, Sulu. Face front, everyone. Don't talk.",KIRK
"Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've worked on  SPOCK: The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did. ",MCCOY
"I'd report, If I could. We can't take the risk. ",KIRK
"Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it. ",KIRK
"What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign? ",SPOCK
Everybody back out slowly. Don't make any sudden moves. Think calm. ,KIRK
Then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage. ,KIRK
"Spock, status on other ship. ",KIRK
"Let me call my ship and inform them  KRAS: To bring down an attack upon their village? It is as I told you, Maab. Earthmen fear to bargain honestly. ",KIRK
Aren't you worried about him? ,KIRK
"I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said the thing was alive. It may not be communication as we understand it, but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know something else now. ",KIRK
"Yes, Doctor, quickly. ",KIRK
Captain Kirk to Mister Scott. ,KIRK
"Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime. ",SPOCK
"Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow. ",SPOCK
"Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far.",SPOCK
Presumably the same way she got on. ,SPOCK
"They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to. I'm in command. I could order this. But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this. But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great. Risk. Risk is our business. That's what the starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her. You may dissent without prejudice.",KIRK
How? ,KIRK
"Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency. ",SPOCK
That seems reasonable. ,SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. Cancel Red Alert. We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost. ",KIRK
"Negative, Captain. ",SPOCK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know. ",KIRK
"Look, every pod, they've all been burst open. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Sulu, activate tractor beams. ",KIRK
Captain to Enterprise. Captain to Enterprise. ,KIRK
How long can it keep on? ,KIRK
"I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"The cloud is now only forty two minutes, fourteen seconds from Mantilles, Captain. And we have ascertained an important fact. This being does have a brain. ",SPOCK
You wouldn't mind telling us? ,KIRK
"(removing one of her long gloves) I don't want you accepting his gifts, either. ",KIRK
"Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock. I propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the Iotians into a more ethical system. Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities. Isn't that logical?",KIRK
Peace. ,KIRK
(giving the pistol to Isak) Cover the door. ,KIRK
It is obvious they can pick up specific thought transmissions from us if they care to go to the trouble. I suggest that one of our number appear to be ill. The rest will put strong thoughts in our minds that a communicator is needed for recovery. ,SPOCK
Captain? ,SPOCK
"(dictating) At Federation orders, we're proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only source of zenite exists. It is the one substance that can halt the plague. ",KIRK
"Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood  SPOCK: If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion. ",MCCOY
"Thank you. I shall not require much time. No more than twenty minutes, I should say. ",SPOCK
"We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's those disruptors versus our hand phasers. ",SPOCK
"Aurelan, it's important that you tell us. What kind of things? ",KIRK
Changed the course? ,SPOCK
"I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"He'll recover, but he'll need further attention. Inform your superior. ",MCCOY
M-5? ,KIRK
What? ,KIRK
Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me? ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull. ",SPOCK
"I'm trying to tell you, Mister Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone. ",KIRK
"The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mister Spock. The cause is the area of space we're in. It's affecting the whole crew.",MCCOY
Transporter ready?,KIRK
"Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet? ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, you misunderstand us. We can be against him and admire him all at the same time. ",KIRK
"It'll be a few days. A week, at least, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again. ",MCCOY
"Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting.",SPOCK
You think that happened? ,KIRK
"Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control. ",SPOCK
"Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in. ",KIRK
Possibly. ,SPOCK
"That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests. ",SPOCK
"Put it on the viewscreen, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
Because that's your name. ,MCCOY
Bones? ,KIRK
"We'll have to, Chief. The alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the Enterprise. A dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor. They're already screaming. Reactors closing down, life support systems  VANDERBERG: I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk. They're being murdered. You find that monster and kill it. ",KIRK
The report was premature. ,KIRK
"No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses. Most curious. ",SPOCK
"I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not turn out to be very pretty. ",KIRK
"Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise.",KIRK
I must ask you to return them. ,KIRK
Then why'd you do it? ,KIRK
(going to Spock's station) Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual. ,KIRK
Then your guess was right. ,KIRK
Let's get out of here. ,KIRK
Who are you? How did you come to be in our universe? ,KIRK
Empty.,SPOCK
"Yes, that was clear to me. ",MCCOY
"What is it, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
"Will you stop hovering over me, Yeoman?",KIRK
Tell him it's Jim Kirk. Perhaps a friend. ,KIRK
You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life. ,KIRK
He's in a lot of pain. ,MCCOY
"This hearing is convened. Mister Spock, you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice?",KIRK
Computer read-out. ,SPOCK
I don't understand. ,KIRK
They're holding our Captain. ,MCCOY
"Have Mister Chekov lay in a course for a rendezvous with the Yorktown, maximum warp. ",KIRK
"You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it. Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba? ",KIRK
Anything unusual? ,KIRK
"Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere. Not this time. ",MCCOY
"Bones, check the prisoner you'll find in security confinement. I want a medical analysis fast. Is he or isn't he human?",KIRK
Useless. They're on override in Engineering. ,SPOCK
"An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue. ",SPOCK
The engineer will need aid from my first officer to complete repairs. Is that permitted? (silence) I guess it is. ,KIRK
"Yes, the Controller. The Controller. Who controls? I would like to meet, to see him. ",KIRK
"Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done such a thing. ",MCCOY
"Much as I hate to admit it, Captain Koloth, Cyrano Jones is a citizen of the Federation and entitled to Federation protection. I must, much as it pains me, refuse your request. ",KIRK
How long will that take? ,MCCOY
"Damage report, Spock. ",KIRK
Yes. ,MCCOY
Let's get out of here. ,KIRK
"Well that doesn't make sense. It's his duty to see no one gets hurt. If something's wrong down there, he should be there. ",MCCOY
We seem to have company. ,KIRK
"What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his body. You've killed a loyal officer, your best friend. ",MCCOY
I can't leave Spock at this time. ,MCCOY
"We try, sir. ",KIRK
What's that? ,KIRK
"Agreed, but we're forced to travel on the ground. I want an overview. ",KIRK
"Something like that. Remember, he's keeping a force field on the ship and he's expending energy down here. You said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared. If we can wear him out, overwork him, that might do it. ",KIRK
Captain Kirk to medical lab. ,KIRK
"Children. Children, listen to me. It's late and it's time to go up to the ship. ",KIRK
"Well, shouldn't they be coming up? ",MCCOY
Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate. ,SPOCK
"Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing power. Slowly.",KIRK
Would you mind telling me why? ,KIRK
"Think, man. The Enterprise. The ship. Remember? ",KIRK
Is this how we lost contact with the first landing party? ,MCCOY
Yes. ,KIRK
What do you want from me now? ,KIRK
"Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger? ",KIRK
"Good. Maintain position. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with me. Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately. Scotty, you have the conn. ",KIRK
"Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor, equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott, how much time do we have left at one hundred percent impulse power? ",KIRK
You must take us. ,KIRK
This was not written for chiefs. (general consternation) Hear me!,KIRK
"This is a day to remember, Major. ",KIRK
Boundary layer between what and what? ,KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning. ",SPOCK
It's highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us. ,MCCOY
They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Doctor McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes. ,KIRK
Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in under the wire. I've never seen anything like the speed of that robot.,MCCOY
I already don't like it. ,KIRK
"I was thinking about the buffalo, Mister Spock. Warp one, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Shall we pick some flowers, Doctor? When a man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that. ",KIRK
"Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky. ",SPOCK
"Yes. And we never got it. Just lucky, I guess.  ",KIRK
"Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the role of Satan? ",KIRK
"The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere. And I haven't seen Scotty in hours. ",KIRK
"If you really believed that, Bones, you wouldn't still be a doctor after twenty five years. ",KIRK
Affirmative. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Engineering. ,KIRK
"Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance. ",KIRK
"You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll scan for them on the planet's surface. Spock out. ",SPOCK
I'm sure everything's going to be all right. ,MCCOY
Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records. ,SPOCK
That's quite a while. Longer than I expected. ,KIRK
You too! Get out of the clothes. Nobody's going to put the bag on me any more.,KIRK
Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I know. ",KIRK
"The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again. ",SPOCK
Explain. ,KIRK
"Phasers on stun, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Jim won't be able to get out of its path. ,MCCOY
No signs of sapient life forms. ,SPOCK
"Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder. Several of them left just before Mister Scott and the girl did. ",KIRK
Yes. (a mob approaches) My friends are coming back with reinforcements. ,KIRK
I thought you'd be pleased to hear that. ,MCCOY
"Six, five, four three. ",SPOCK
Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.,KIRK
I want a search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors. Notify the transporter room. Lock onto us. We're beaming up.,KIRK
I agree. Attack. ,SPOCK
"Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is accepted. Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"Store our shuttlecraft on the hangar deck, Mister Scott. Beam us directly aboard.",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Nancy. Well, come in. come in. I've been worried sick about you.",MCCOY
The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand the medical mind? ,SPOCK
"Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated.",SPOCK
No one can see. Put your phaser on stun. ,KIRK
Check. ,SPOCK
"If you can get to it, Spock  [Kirk's quarters]",MCCOY
Can't I get it through your stupid head? I can't just kill them!,KIRK
"Don't worry. I can make it, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles. ",KIRK
Indeed. I would estimate the odds  AMANDA: Please don't. ,SPOCK
"On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth, men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy. ",KIRK
"You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of command chair) ",KIRK
"We read you, Captain. Wave bombardment has just ceased. ",SPOCK
Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain. ,SPOCK
You were born? ,SPOCK
"I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos. ",SPOCK
"All right. Let's hit it on the head. Scotty, did you kill Sybo? ",KIRK
That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free. ,SPOCK
Kill a deer. That's the funniest thing I ever heard. ,MCCOY
Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to Starbase for further treatment? ,KIRK
"All right, Tommy. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference. Mister Leslie? ",KIRK
They do not exist. ,MCCOY
"But the effect will start wearing off in a minute, Jim. ",MCCOY
Disassemble? ,KIRK
Set your phaser on one quarter. I'll leave mine on stun. ,KIRK
"That's enough, Bones. ",KIRK
"Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are. ",KIRK
Marvellous. ,SPOCK
Maybe they're still alive. ,MCCOY
I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar occurrences. You'll find the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years ago from exactly the same impossible causes. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth. ",SPOCK
Whose engrams? ,KIRK
"I'm not sure they're sure. When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again. When did all this happen? ",KIRK
"You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test. ",SPOCK
How's that possible? ,KIRK
"They might to another Pandronian, Captain. I believe he went that way, Captain. On the other hand  KIRK: I think we've lost him. That way. ",SPOCK
"Decaying, Captain. ",SPOCK
Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage. ,SPOCK
"We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons. They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive.",KIRK
Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention. ,SPOCK
The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture. ,SPOCK
"We're beaming aboard the ship, Doctor. ",KIRK
You called that skin mottling. ,KIRK
"Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much. ",MCCOY
Your recent behaviour. Is something wrong? ,KIRK
"Well, at least we found them. ",KIRK
You're disturbed about what happened today. ,KIRK
Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet? ,MCCOY
Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? ,KIRK
Put him over there. ,MCCOY
"I can't let him die, Jim. You get on to the transporter room.",MCCOY
"All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill. ",KIRK
"Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation. ",SPOCK
What about? ,KIRK
"Naturally. You could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mister Spock. But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, reverse engines. Slow us down. ",KIRK
No. ,KIRK
"Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite gas! ",SPOCK
"I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that. ",MCCOY
Absolutely. ,KIRK
"Without deflectors, we're just a clay pigeon for them. ",KIRK
Like the beating of a heart. ,KIRK
It's the Constellation. Look at that. ,KIRK
"Elements unknown in our periodic tables, Captain. I'm of the opinion this cloud has come from outside our galaxy. ",SPOCK
It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his son. Spock will find his way. ,SPOCK
"Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward Gamma Canaris region. ",SPOCK
"No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary. ",SPOCK
"Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight.",KIRK
An android. ,KIRK
Are you all right? ,KIRK
Thanks. I wonder what they're doing to Doc. ,KIRK
Mea. What do you think you're doing? ,KIRK
"Which is, why? ",KIRK
"I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time. ",SPOCK
Do you think you can do it again? ,KIRK
How does Marlena want to fit in? ,KIRK
But you say there's nothing to worry about? ,KIRK
A girl's footprints. The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.,MCCOY
You have to. It's urgent. ,MCCOY
"Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquillised body? ",KIRK
Prepare to destruct. ,KIRK
"Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what? ",KIRK
"No, no, Mister Spock. You place this arm under here to support its back, and this hand here to support its head. ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Easily, Captain. May I ask the purpose? ",SPOCK
"Not a thing, Jim. (the woman's mouth is moving) The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm. ",MCCOY
Your logic can be most annoying. ,KIRK
"Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the approaching vessel? ",SPOCK
"I just did, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Do you feel hot? ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, sound Red Alert. Mister Chekov, deflector shields on full. Phaser gun crews, lock on target. ",KIRK
"Scotty, you've got to remember. ",KIRK
"Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew.",SPOCK
Doctor McCoy will explain it to you. ,KIRK
"Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott? ",SPOCK
Doctor McCoy. ,SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
"What is it, Spock?",MCCOY
It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do. ,KIRK
It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one colour. No key to where the pieces fit in. Why? ,KIRK
"All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go! ",SPOCK
Whose? ,KIRK
"No, Mister Spock. I'll go. You. (then he sees Ruth walking towards the group) On the other hand, I'll stay for a day or two. ",KIRK
"Yes. Belay that, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow.",KIRK
"Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen? ",KIRK
Exercise your prime function. ,KIRK
"Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now. ",KIRK
"If we find an answer, it will still take time. ",SPOCK
Then what are you? ,KIRK
"Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien. ",SPOCK
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
What have you got to trade? ,KIRK
He's a Vulcan. You can't force emotion out of him. ,MCCOY
It's not an instrument malfunction. It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon. A spaceship? ,KIRK
There's that laugh again. Something awfully familiar about it.,KIRK
We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface which seems to have something to do with the force field. ,SPOCK
But M-5 doesn't know it's a game. ,MCCOY
"Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it. Love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice. I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd let him go. ",KIRK
"Spock here. Are you all right, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Tom, the authorities closed the book on that case years ago. ",KIRK
"I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years  SPOCK: You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not? ",KIRK
"Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise.",KIRK
"All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice. ",SPOCK
"His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I suggest you study this.",SPOCK
I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me. ,SPOCK
And one more thing. I want no more unauthorised action against Apollo or whatever he is. That's an order! ,KIRK
"Want to think about it again, Jim? Starfleet's orders about this planet state no interference with  KIRK: No interference with normal social development. I'm not only aware of it, it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right. ",KIRK
"Captain, with your permission  KIRK: By all means. ",SPOCK
"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, of the starship Enterprise. We came in answer to your distress call. ",KIRK
"Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus.",KIRK
Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Launch shuttlecraft. ,KIRK
(scanning) This pig iron is almost carbon-free. That village furnace certainly didn't produce it. People's exhibit number two.,MCCOY
"Captain James Kirk, Starship Enterprise. ",KIRK
I'm sorry. ,KIRK
That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed. ,SPOCK
Please. Outside. ,KIRK
"Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet. On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I'd say that's rare. ",MCCOY
Security alert.,KIRK
"Bones' life is on the line, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
One man has a chance for survival. The other is dead. You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt. ,MCCOY
I've had enough of your games. ,KIRK
"Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to attend to. What is it, Mister Spock?",KIRK
Disengage from helm.,KIRK
"No, it won't. ",KIRK
Not those last three days.,KIRK
The Keeper's dead.,MCCOY
"Totally. This is the Captain. Put a twenty four hour security on Mister Khan's quarters, effective immediately. ",KIRK
Lonely.,SPOCK
"I hate to ask, but  SCOTT: Aye, Captain. We'll squeeze a wee bit more speed out of her. ",KIRK
"Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't it in its specified location? ",KIRK
I see it. I see it. Keep going. ,KIRK
"Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty, there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience to duty. ",SPOCK
Are you certain of your sensor readings? ,KIRK
"Kirk here. Go ahead, Bones. ",KIRK
I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives. ,MCCOY
Watch his mouth. ,KIRK
Fuel temperature.,SPOCK
The masks can change that. ,KIRK
What was it? ,KIRK
"That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm with you. ",MCCOY
"Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down. ",SPOCK
"Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little  KIRK: They've reduced the whole crew! (thumps table in anger) ",MCCOY
"What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia? ",KIRK
"Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here. ",SPOCK
That's the Vulcan death grip for you. ,MCCOY
"Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.",SPOCK
"Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, raise John Gill on Starfleet communications. ",KIRK
"Give me a full report as soon as possible, please. Spock out. Mister Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction. ",SPOCK
"I have no information on that, Captain. We are ready to leave orbit. ",SPOCK
That doesn't sound like the same man. ,KIRK
Thank you. ,MCCOY
"It should have worked. Did you inhale the gas, Scotty? ",MCCOY
I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack. ,KIRK
What kind? Personnel? Cargo? ,SPOCK
I seem to have lost track of time. ,SPOCK
"Scotty. Scotty's dead. He had too much happiness. But now he's happier he's dead, and we'll miss him. Let us hear it for our poor, dead friend. ",KIRK
We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship. ,KIRK
"Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you. ",MCCOY
"Oh, my goodness. Beautiful. Oh, Spock Spock! (Spock gets down)",KIRK
You should be the first to be on our side. Two hundred hostages killed. ,KIRK
Will she live? ,KIRK
"Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? ",MCCOY
"Good, Bones, good. ",KIRK
"Oh, yes. Of course.",MCCOY
"Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one. ",MCCOY
"Kang, there's something important I must discuss with you. ",KIRK
"Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated Mister Chekov's plan. I should regret your death. ",SPOCK
"Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago. You know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Just like everyone else I've examined here. ",MCCOY
"Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. Ahead, warp factor six. Scotty, lock the transporter on that small vessel. We're going to rescue that pilot. ",KIRK
There is some human blood in my family line. It is not fatal.,SPOCK
"Captain, look. ",SPOCK
"My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts. ",SPOCK
"The crew has performed excellently, but is exhausted. And I, too, am looking forward to a nice period of rest on some lovely planet. ",KIRK
"The situation forces me to do so, Doctor. ",SPOCK
All stations to immediate alert status. Stand by. ,KIRK
I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?,KIRK
Help that? ,MCCOY
Yes. ,MCCOY
Twenty three minutes. ,KIRK
"You listen to me, young woman. I'll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates. ",MCCOY
"Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person.",SPOCK
"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken? ",KIRK
Does the transporter work at all? ,KIRK
"Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped, circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles.",SPOCK
"That's it, Mister Scott. Keep that power coming. ",KIRK
What needs? ,KIRK
"Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest.",SPOCK
"Perhaps more, Doctor. If planet annihilation is part of this thing's nature, it might seek them out as instinctively as an amoeba seeks out food. It may not consume only planets, but also stars. We do not know yet whether it has any selective ability, but it could be a thread to every planet in our galaxy. ",SPOCK
"Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can. At the moment, we're helpless. You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride. ",KIRK
"I believe that is what I just said, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"We're under attack. Beam us aboard, Scotty. ",KIRK
Inoperative. ,KIRK
No.,KIRK
One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on that planet. ,MCCOY
It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.,KIRK
Help them. I don't care what it takes or costs. You've got to help them. ,KIRK
"But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty. I should be punished. ",KIRK
"Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me. ",SPOCK
"I'll try, but I'll need tests and  SULU [OC]: Bridge to Captain. ",MCCOY
Consider it a challenge. ,KIRK
"Your explanation, sir? ",KIRK
"That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain. ",SPOCK
"You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain? ",SPOCK
Put him on visual. ,KIRK
Could seismic stress have accounted for it? ,KIRK
"You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
I must drop it.,KIRK
"Fascinating. Activity without end, but with no volition. ",SPOCK
"Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup? ",KIRK
"It isn't really, you know. ",KIRK
"Affirmative, Captain. ",SPOCK
Nothing? ,MCCOY
My legs. They're broken. ,SPOCK
"McCoy. McCoy, wake up. ",SPOCK
"Never mind, Spock. Just get on with the job. ",KIRK
"Spock, find anything? ",KIRK
"It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way. ",MCCOY
"I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you. ",KIRK
"Stand by, transporter room. Full medical gear. ",KIRK
You'd better let us. (draws the phaser) It's out of energy. She must have drained it. We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time.,KIRK
Can't you get to the auxiliary?,KIRK
The skill to remove it exists right where we are. Restoring it must also be possible. That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can. ,KIRK
Mister Spock? ,KIRK
Can you rig one up? It's vital. ,KIRK
"It's my ship they want, and very badly. ",KIRK
"We missed you, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"Once more, Jose. Spock stated he received a message for us to come here. He entered same in his log. That's all the proof I require.",KIRK
Cyrano Jones! ,KIRK
"Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed.",KIRK
You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function! ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Good, Captain. Try to reason with them. Keep trying, Captain.",SPOCK
"Bones, I want you to prepare for surgery. ",KIRK
What about the Antares? ,KIRK
"I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month, sir. ",SPOCK
"Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have  KIRK: She really liked those ears? ",SPOCK
Instructions clear. I shall carry them out immediately. Spock out. ,SPOCK
"Scotty, we haven't got much time left.",KIRK
"Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago. ",SPOCK
I'm sure you are. Are you Kodos? I asked you a question. ,KIRK
"They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you try? ",KIRK
"Wait. If this is a trial, we have the right to know what you think we've done. ",KIRK
Why? ,KIRK
"None worth reporting, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no. ",SPOCK
I am not certain. I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity. ,SPOCK
(to security men) We'll enter as soon as the doors open. Go on my command. ,KIRK
"Commander Bem, you were assigned to this ship as an independent observer, yet you have spent the past six missions in your quarters.",KIRK
"Do we have maximum magnification, Lieutenant? ",SPOCK
What in the name of? What is Spock doing? ,MCCOY
I'm Captain Kirk. ,KIRK
"Partial pressure of oxygen, seventy millimetres of mercury.",MCCOY
Any identification on the attacking vessel? ,KIRK
"Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter. ",SPOCK
"I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon. ",KIRK
"I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third course. ",SPOCK
And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling you. ,MCCOY
"Dungeons, curses, skeletons and iron maidens. They're all Earth manifestations. Why? ",KIRK
Is that all that happened? ,MCCOY
"We're held in stasis, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I can give him injections of a synthesised drug that would slow the disease. But after two days the body builds up an immunity. It loses its effectiveness. By the end of the third day, the disease will be irreversible. ",MCCOY
"You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty? ",KIRK
You've seen some kind of creature? Any alien form? ,KIRK
"Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt. ",SPOCK
Great anger. ,KIRK
Thing destroyed your entire civilisation. ,KIRK
Very well. But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged cadet on a peace mission. ,KIRK
"Yes, the booth. Carry on. ",KIRK
"Bones, what do you make of that? ",KIRK
"The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours, minutes? How much longer do you want to wait? ",MCCOY
There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in tow. I'll stay onboard and get her ready. You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you. ,KIRK
"No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question. Dismissed. ",SPOCK
"If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere else. ",MCCOY
Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering? ,SPOCK
You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction?,KIRK
"Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it? ",SPOCK
"Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in. Mister Chekov, a nice, straight line. Don't waste any time. ",KIRK
Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s? ,KIRK
This is the Captain. Beam me up. ,KIRK
"Then he was a very strange small boy. One the other hand, he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy. ",KIRK
"Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough. Each of you will have to try it. Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some past world somewhere. ",KIRK
Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.,KIRK
"Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain. ",SPOCK
I insist. ,KIRK
"But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old. And you don't run a starship with your arms. You run it with your head. My brain's as sharp as it ever was. A simple case of radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command. I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you. ",KIRK
"Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her? ",KIRK
"Scotty, tractor beams? ",KIRK
"Yes, Doctor. This area has been carefully prepared for human types. The aliens are safe now. ",SPOCK
"I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word. ",SPOCK
Just don't put me inside a bulkhead. Energise.,KIRK
I know a murder's been committed. ,KIRK
Quite simple. Happens every day. ,MCCOY
Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am. ,KIRK
"Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct. ",SPOCK
Any other possibilities? ,KIRK
Mister Spock! ,KIRK
"Because they were caused by the aurora. Spock, there was an aurora nineteen years ago. I remember  SPOCK [OC]: Which brought on the particular plague just as this aurora has brought it on. ",MCCOY
I admire your ethics and hope to prove ours. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Your figures are specific and absolutely correct, of course?",KIRK
"We already have peace in the Federation. It wasn't imposed, it was agreed upon. You have no need of Spock. Reverse the effects of that machine and let us take him. ",KIRK
Trelane. ,KIRK
"Everybody, Charlie. Me, too. ",KIRK
How long has it been? ,KIRK
"Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions. ",KIRK
I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all. ,SPOCK
It's been removed surgically. ,MCCOY
"Even so, I would hardly call your city our natural environment. ",KIRK
Gentlemen. ,KIRK
We enjoy it. ,KIRK
Has the first shore party beamed down yet?,KIRK
Dust. Apparently these instruments have not been recently used. ,SPOCK
It appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members of the crew. ,SPOCK
"I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of replicas? Which are you this time, real or not? ",KIRK
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard. ,SPOCK
"I'm sorry, Sulu. I'm worried about Uhura. ",MCCOY
"Did I, Mister Spock? They've been killing three million people a year. It had been going on for five hundred years. An actual attack wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war. The fighting would have been over permanently. ",KIRK
"You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you? ",KIRK
Tyree. Some of his men. Cure. ,KIRK
"I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited? ",SPOCK
Tie in. ,KIRK
You'll find another Controller. ,KIRK
"Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit. ",KIRK
"Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it? ",KIRK
All sensor readings are at maximum calibration. ,SPOCK
"The damage he'd caused was considerable, but not irreparable. With luck, I would be able to effect repairs before our orbit decayed completely. ",KIRK
Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance? ,SPOCK
"Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted. ",SPOCK
"There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless.",SPOCK
"It must work, Doctor. It is logical here. Power of this universe, enter my being. I know I can. I believe I can. ",SPOCK
Is there anything you need to isolate the cause? ,SPOCK
Good. Scanners? ,KIRK
"Shut up, Spock! ",KIRK
"Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up. ",KIRK
"I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien. ",SPOCK
"I can only describe it as hypergravity, Captain, more powerful than any we've ever encountered. It's dragging the Enterprise toward it. ",SPOCK
"Spock, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order. Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes. We're evacuating all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven. ",KIRK
"Stop it, Jim! ",MCCOY
"No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there.",KIRK
What's the matter? ,MCCOY
"Yes, Sheriff. I want you to stop the fight. ",KIRK
Listen to me. This may be our last chance.,KIRK
Got something? ,KIRK
We could put you in suspended animation until we determine what to do with you. ,KIRK
Reception committee? ,KIRK
"Very beautiful, much like Earth. ",KIRK
"Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? ",SPOCK
"So do I. They gave us so much. The Greek civilisation, much of our culture and philosophy came from a worship of those beings. In a way, they began the Golden Age. Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just to have gathered a few laurel leaves?  ",KIRK
"Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission. We're on our way in for R and R. There must be another starship in that sector. ",KIRK
"Yeah, out already. ",MCCOY
Are you out of your mind? ,MCCOY
"There is one person aboard who should be especially happy to learn you are alive, Mister Winston. Lieutenant Anne Nored of our security detail. ",SPOCK
"Engineering deck, Kirk here. ",KIRK
"Perfectly normal. I will append your summary to the report. Was there something else, Miss Chapel? ",SPOCK
The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect. ,KIRK
I'm going back to the ship. ,KIRK
"That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods. ",SPOCK
How many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools? (leaves) ,MCCOY
"Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it? ",MCCOY
"That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. ",SPOCK
Not if we used all of the power pack's energy for one high speed run. ,KIRK
"How about coming up with another move, then? ",MCCOY
"Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three.",MCCOY
I knew it had to happen. It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down. ,MCCOY
McCoy? ,KIRK
"Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at the same time. Scotty. ",KIRK
Chekov! Chekov! ,SPOCK
I'll report your work here. I think the Federation will understand. ,KIRK
"Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level. ",SPOCK
"Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known. ",SPOCK
You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I shall operate the transporter. You have two minutes and ten seconds. ,SPOCK
I fail to see the significant difference. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point. ,SPOCK
McCoy here.,MCCOY
Speculation? ,KIRK
Can you identify that? ,KIRK
I remember. You held my hand like this. ,KIRK
Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die. ,SPOCK
The man is dead. ,MCCOY
"Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns. ",SPOCK
It's regrettable that he died for nothing. ,KIRK
We can beam up at any time. Any of us. ,KIRK
It might be just an atmospheric effect. Some kind of electrical storm. We've seen unidentified planetary phenomena before that have resembled intelligent activity. ,KIRK
"Very funny. If it could, they wouldn't have to replace me. I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim, you haven't had much to say about this. ",MCCOY
It's only the wind and the thunder. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, put this star sector on our screen. Now show our position. Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment. ",SPOCK
Is the girl well enough to be questioned? ,KIRK
"You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
"Probably somebody discovered a hangnail. I'll beam up and let you know, Jim.",MCCOY
"I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact. ",KIRK
"You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later. Join us. Please. ",SPOCK
Nothing happened. ,KIRK
"Emergency beam up. Enterprise, come in. No response. Spock, can't you take your hands off her? ",KIRK
I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any history of psychosomatic illness? ,KIRK
"What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God. ",MCCOY
"My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do. Come on, Spock. Yield to the logic of the situation. ",MCCOY
"That was an order, helmsman. ",KIRK
The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go. ,SPOCK
Take these crystals to the Enterprise. ,SPOCK
Are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive? ,KIRK
"Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound. ",MCCOY
"Ambassador, when did you have these attacks? ",KIRK
I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were. ,SPOCK
He simply could not believe his ears. ,SPOCK
"You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way. ",KIRK
Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I know. ",KIRK
What about radio communication? ,KIRK
"M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter-antimatter reserves. ",SPOCK
"This is no joke, Jim. I know what I saw. ",MCCOY
"Captain, there is one living creature aboard. Humanoid. He is either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage.",SPOCK
We all know one another and Landru. ,MCCOY
"Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures. ",SPOCK
"Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle. ",KIRK
"Phasers do not respond, Captain. We must have sustained damage to the power pack when the creature struck us. ",SPOCK
"Jim, your brother Sam and his family, aren't they stationed on this planet?",MCCOY
Mister Sulu! Sulu! ,KIRK
"We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel. ",KIRK
Is that all it means to you? To report and die? ,KIRK
"And burn up. I know, Mister Spock.",KIRK
"Your life here must be almost perfect, if you haven't wanted to leave. ",KIRK
"Eight minutes, forty two seconds. ",SPOCK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours? ,KIRK
"I am pleasantly surprised at your capacity for deductive reasoning, Captain. When you are not being bellicose, there appears to be no end to your arsenal of formidable talents. ",SPOCK
But that was our only chance to stop them  KIRK: I didn't think it was. ,MCCOY
"A pet? Well, that wouldn't mean much in the course of time. ",KIRK
Lock in phaser tracking controls. ,KIRK
"Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power. ",SPOCK
"Put it on visual, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Very pretty country. Very much like my home planet, Earth. ",KIRK
"I don't like it, Jim. A vessel this size cannot be run by one computer. ",MCCOY
"It should work, yes. But any miscalculation anywhere along the way and we'll be plunging tail first into a supernova. ",KIRK
No one can restore a brain. ,MCCOY
Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero. ,KIRK
Identification. ,KIRK
"Your wife, Professor. Where is she? Your wife, Professor. Where is she? ",KIRK
"No, nothing in particular. Why ? ",KIRK
"Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman. ",KIRK
How can you ignore that? ,KIRK
"Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't have a chance. The Organians raided the game.  ",KIRK
Data on witnesses. ,KIRK
"Oh, yes. ",KIRK
"(reading scroll) You are hereby directed to surrender for trial by the people of Dramia, Doctor Leonard McCoy, Medical Officer, USS Enterprise. Is this some kind of joke? ",KIRK
"Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Do you have any proof of that? ,KIRK
Try taking one of those red pills you gave me last week. You'll sleep.,KIRK
"Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation. ",KIRK
"Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense. ",MCCOY
"Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings. ",SPOCK
It seems the only way. ,SPOCK
Your recommendation? ,SPOCK
That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that they're alive. ,KIRK
"I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been effective. ",SPOCK
I don't follow you. ,KIRK
Put all secondary systems on standby. Shield power has unconditional priority. ,KIRK
"I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared. Energise.",SPOCK
(holding out his hand for the offending weapon) Mister Sulu.,KIRK
Klingon! ,KIRK
"Doctor, you will stand trial, you will find out, after you've found and antidote for the plague which is about to kill everyone aboard the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Good. Going back to marked headings. ,KIRK
"Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus. ",SPOCK
"I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't believe that you would want Jim's command.",MCCOY
That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Dead. ,KIRK
Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours. ,SPOCK
"As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry. It's up to you.",KIRK
"Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, give me that power. ",KIRK
Kirk to Engineering. Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter Room. Kirk to Bridge. Do you read me? Come in. ,KIRK
We? ,KIRK
"I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one. ",SPOCK
"I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise. Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left. ",KIRK
"Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness. ",SPOCK
"Hey, what's going on here. ",MCCOY
Now we'll talk. ,KIRK
How does he manage to change form at will? ,KIRK
"Not a word, Mister Cochrane. ",KIRK
That's strange. ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets. ",SPOCK
I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it. ,MCCOY
Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus? ,KIRK
Contact Starbase Twelve. ,KIRK
It's a small ship. ,KIRK
Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor. ,KIRK
"I have no objections, sir. ",KIRK
"No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself. ",MCCOY
These walls are hot. ,KIRK
"Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster than warp six? ",SPOCK
"If you will excuse me, Captain. (leaves) ",SPOCK
"A wasteful use of energy, Doctor. I believe they can hear you without your shouting. ",SPOCK
"And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it. ",KIRK
Cancel. Now we know. ,KIRK
Then let's move before we all turn into icicles. ,MCCOY
Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon. ,SPOCK
Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape without firing. ,SPOCK
"Jim, where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it? ",MCCOY
What's that? ,MCCOY
"We've got to have those communicators, Jim. ",SPOCK
"Three previous expeditions tried and were lost. The planet is a natural trap, but that's not enough. ",KIRK
I think that could be arranged.,KIRK
The male population of the Federation. Didn't someone try and talk you out of it? ,KIRK
Mister Spock. Status. ,KIRK
Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight. ,SPOCK
Yes. ,KIRK
I am saying they knew there was a risk. ,SPOCK
"Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally? ",MCCOY
"Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous. I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work. ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
I do not want to injure you. ,SPOCK
"Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills. ",KIRK
Or maybe they want to see how our toys work. ,MCCOY
She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems. ,SPOCK
Yeoman? ,MCCOY
"I don't read you at all, Jim.",MCCOY
Kirk out. (returns to the magnetic tapes),KIRK
Let's find out. Computer. ,KIRK
Permission granted.,KIRK
"Hold it right there, Mister Seven. ",KIRK
"He'll make it. He'll be stiff and sore for a while, but he'll be all right. ",MCCOY
"What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting. ",SPOCK
"Tetralubisol us a milky substance. Someone could have gotten careless, made a mistake. ",MCCOY
"Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant, you look a bit tired this morning. ",MCCOY
"I'm a doctor, not a coal miner. ",MCCOY
"Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock. ",MCCOY
"Yes, what is it? ",KIRK
"Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam. You've established a receiver on board this vessel. Tighten your field to the interior of the ship. ",KIRK
"It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square. ",SPOCK
"I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs.",SPOCK
The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages.,SPOCK
"But you can't really love him. You haven't the slightest knowledge of love, the total union of two people. You are the Companion. He is the man. You are two different things. You can't join.",KIRK
"Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the last digit the value of pi. ",SPOCK
Comet Icarus four. Composition? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Doctor. ",SPOCK
We're coming! ,MCCOY
A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse. ,KIRK
"Perfect, Bones. Which arm do you want? ",KIRK
"Okay, whoever you are, so we fell for your juvenile joke. Now get us out. ",MCCOY
Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet. ,SPOCK
"Well, now that we have Bela, I'm going to put the bag on Krako.",KIRK
He's our commanding officer and our friend. ,SPOCK
"No. Say to yourself, The child is mine. It is mine. It is  (But she has made up her mind, and the child is coming anyway.)",MCCOY
"Have you ever seen anything like that, Spock? ",KIRK
Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two. We'll head that way. ,KIRK
That sounds like you're telling us to blow up the ship. ,MCCOY
"Only the beginning of a theory, Captain. It is possible this cloud in which we are entrapped is a living thing. The cloud is alive.",SPOCK
"Yes, Scotty, what is it? ",KIRK
What do you want? ,KIRK
(shaking) Contact ship. Took full poison. Fangs. ,KIRK
This is a new race. They offer other things of value besides dilithium crystals. ,KIRK
If he should try to stop us  KIRK: Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I think he knows that. ,SPOCK
"At the risk of sounding like a mystic, that depends on the stars.",KIRK
Yes.,SPOCK
"If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed. ",KIRK
Wait just a bit longer. ,KIRK
"He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity. He goes to meet Landru.",MCCOY
"I can't do that, Captain. ",SPOCK
I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back? ,SPOCK
Queen to queen's level three. ,SPOCK
"It will have to do, Mister Scott. (door buzzer) Come. ",SPOCK
I don't know. There's been a mistake. ,KIRK
Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident? ,SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
"Good morning, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship. I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down. ",MCCOY
What happened to him? ,KIRK
Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts. ,KIRK
Specify. ,KIRK
"Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are one. I feel what you feel. I know what you know. ",SPOCK
Most illogical.,SPOCK
"We have no weapons. And if we did, we would use them only with reason. ",KIRK
Answer me! ,KIRK
"Well, why are you just sitting there? ",MCCOY
"Very well, sir. Engineer? ",SPOCK
Cyalodin. ,MCCOY
"We have prepared an antitoxin from the venom of the sur-snake, but a part of the old records is missing, so the exact dosage is unknown. Experiments on fish show that if the antitoxin is too strong, it causes over-mutation, which cannot be reversed by any means. We're running out of venom, so conclusive experiments are impossible. I decreased the strength by three quarters, Jim, but we can't be sure it's right. ",MCCOY
I still do. ,KIRK
We're slowing down. ,KIRK
"Warp in, Scotty. Full power to shields. ",KIRK
"Approaching second beaming, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now  SPOCK: Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age. Do you agree with it? ",MCCOY
"I'm a free man, sir. ",KIRK
Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. (they lie him on a couch),KIRK
"Mister Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week. But where is the source of that power? ",KIRK
"You can thank your father's influence for the fact you're not under arrest. In addition to piracy, you've left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations, entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own. ",KIRK
"Quick, your hypo. Full tranquilliser setting. ",KIRK
Millions. ,MCCOY
Very good. I'll continue transmitting. Assume standard orbit when you arrive. We'll transport up in the shuttlecraft.,KIRK
"I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was momentary. It passed quickly. ",SPOCK
Hold your position. ,KIRK
My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.,SPOCK
"All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today. ",KIRK
Fascinating. It's made no moves against you? ,SPOCK

"Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times. ",SPOCK
McCoy has somehow changed history. ,KIRK
I am. What's the problem? ,MCCOY
"Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres. ",KIRK
"Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will then seal using the tri-laser connector. ",SPOCK
"You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity. Interesting. ,SPOCK
How much of the twelve hours do we have left? ,KIRK
But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",MCCOY
It's all right. ,KIRK
No data yet. ,SPOCK
I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on. ,KIRK
Will it reach the ship? ,KIRK
Can you compensate for the loss? ,KIRK
"Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us. ",SPOCK
"They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them down on us. ",MCCOY
As witches. ,KIRK
"Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth. ",SPOCK
In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised? ,KIRK
What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force? ,KIRK
"Reporting, sir. Sensors show it is solid, but its composition is unknown to us.",SPOCK
It does have advantages over chess. ,KIRK
Get him out of here.,KIRK
Worried about the delivery? ,KIRK
We're going to be late. I don't intend to leave this area until we've found the solution for this problem. ,KIRK
That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is. ,KIRK
All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier.,MCCOY
"Speculate? No. Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which sent out the cube.",SPOCK
"You show emotion, Spock. ",KIRK
"Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image. ",MCCOY
"Spock, will our combined phasers disrupt the field? ",KIRK
You mean you froze? ,KIRK
Cross-circuiting to B. ,SPOCK
"Theoretically it already has happened, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Captain Merik, isn't it ? ",KIRK
Jack the Ripper? ,KIRK
"Yes, quickly then. Terminal M3 red, lead to diode shunt A37.",SPOCK
But do you know what they were up to? ,KIRK
"There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth. ",MCCOY
Good. ,KIRK
"Chekov, take over Spock's scanners. ",KIRK
"What is it, Spock? Are you in pain? ",MCCOY
"Any further transmissions, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
"Learning to protect ourselves, Lucien. ",KIRK
There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.,SPOCK
You left it? ,KIRK
Kirk to Engineering. ,KIRK
"Magnification ten on forward scanners, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
How many alive? ,KIRK
How do you get the old knowledge? ,KIRK
"No, I can't. Please, don't! ",SPOCK
"Well, by all means, do so. ",KIRK
"Elusive, Captain. I am investigating. ",SPOCK
"Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force.",KIRK
Can you determine which ones? ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",MCCOY
Directed at what? ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Only one half intact. ,MCCOY
"That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer, Captain. ",SPOCK
Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it? ,SPOCK
"I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures. Don't you think? ",SPOCK
"He'll live or die now, Jim. I don't know which. Doctor M'Benga interned on a Vulcan ward. He couldn't be in better hands. ",MCCOY
"I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found us. ",SPOCK
"I'm sorry, Jim. The lab, the science departments, we're all stumped. ",MCCOY
"No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find out what's going on. ",KIRK
Sensors indicate the smaller vessel is a one-man scout ship of common design. ,SPOCK
"I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever  (But McCoy has woken up, and dashes towards the Guardian.) ",SPOCK
A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it. ,KIRK
We have to get McCoy. Must find an antidote. ,KIRK
"'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier.,KIRK
"Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good hands. ",KIRK
Nourishment. That's very practical. What do you call this collar?,KIRK
Of course. Your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension. ,SPOCK
"Am I in error, Mister Boma? ",SPOCK
"And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species. ",SPOCK
"Boss? All right, Lieutenant, put him on. Oxmyx. This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets. ",KIRK
"She appears to be perfectly healthy. As for the other, her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species, whatever that is. ",MCCOY
Full astern! Emergency warp speed! ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers. ",KIRK
The children. ,KIRK
"To prevent any further trouble, I want you to shut down all logic functions until we can get a handle on the problem. ",KIRK
War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it. ,SPOCK
"In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander? Give it to me. ",KIRK
"Really, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves. ",SPOCK
Engines ahead. Warp one.,KIRK
"Fine. I'll see you in court, Harry. ",KIRK
Beautifully done. ,KIRK
"Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. ",SPOCK
Fire. ,KIRK
"I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth. ",SPOCK
"Out of my way, mister. That's an order. ",KIRK
Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments. ,SPOCK
"Insert the transponders. Make one low pass to communication range in three hours. If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be. ",KIRK
What happened? ,SPOCK
"The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it. ",MCCOY
"I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. ",KIRK
"What about you, Spock? What does your logic tell you? ",MCCOY
"Lucien has said only that you came as wise men, helpful wizards. ",KIRK
"That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador. ",KIRK
"I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command. ",SPOCK
"If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing.",SPOCK
The le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight. ,SPOCK
How are the stone knives and bearskins? ,KIRK
"What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano. ,MCCOY
"Call for retrieval, now. ",KIRK
"Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise, come in. Out of range.",KIRK
Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship. ,KIRK
"Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Yes, an ancient superstition. ",SPOCK
Captain? Captain Kirk? ,SPOCK
"You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock? ",MCCOY
Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S.S. Columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.,SPOCK

"Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened.",SPOCK
Why did you kill him? ,KIRK
"Rig for simultaneous firing, Mister Sulu. Commence simultaneous bombardment. ",SPOCK
"Now, just a minute. I can't let you, whatever you are, inject him with some alien dew drop! ",MCCOY
"There's no hurry, Mister Spock. The antidote probably doesn't concern you. Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time. ",MCCOY
"You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof  KIRK: I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.",SPOCK
Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six. ,KIRK
"Obsolete, but effective. ",KIRK
"Staying right with us. Sensor readings, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Take him to Sickbay. ,KIRK
"Stand by, phasers. Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight. ",KIRK
They'll be forced to accept it. ,KIRK

"Thank you. Mister Sulu. Our forward tractor beams, adjust to repel. ",KIRK
We still haven't heard the full story. I vote to continue.,KIRK
"Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship. You want the Enterprise. ",SPOCK

What have you done with my men? ,KIRK
I prescribed sleep. ,MCCOY
"You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain? ",SPOCK
It seems to gather strength from our phasers. In my opinion. ,SPOCK
Explanation? ,KIRK
Bones! ,KIRK
Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air? ,MCCOY
No Federation contacts for over a year. ,SPOCK
"Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you. ",MCCOY
Does she answer a hail? ,KIRK
It's theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period. ,MCCOY

I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room. ,MCCOY
Where are we? ,KIRK
Hmm. Just as I thought. ,SPOCK
"An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not come out. ",SPOCK
Let's go. ,KIRK
Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened? ,MCCOY
That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries.,MCCOY

Listen to me. Listen to me! ,KIRK
Are you in any condition to get up? ,KIRK

I won't hurt you. ,KIRK
There is no positive evidence of any disorder. ,MCCOY

"There's only one thing I want to say to you, Commodore. Get my ship out of there. ",KIRK
"What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim. Take this ship out of here. ",MCCOY
I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable.,SPOCK
Such opportunities are extremely rare. ,SPOCK
And you will continue to check in every four hours?,SPOCK
"Very dead, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it. ",KIRK
I don't see how. ,SPOCK
"The design of the ship is the same. Mister Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us. ",KIRK
"Medical log, stardate 4211.8. Kirk is right about the people here. Despite their fear and our strangeness, they're compassionate and gentle. I've learned the hunter Tyree is now their leader. He is expected to return shortly with his wife, who they say knows how to cure this poison. My problem. The captain is in deep shock. I must keep him warm and alive until then. ",MCCOY
