the radar operator captain
what is it webb
blip sir just came on the screen
how do you read it
aircraft of some sort by the size of it and the speed it not one of ours sir it doesn even read like anything ve ever seen
what was the approach
none sir it was just there like it fell out of the sky or something
suddenly interested current position
directly over the omaha installation sir holding there
watch the scope webb air defence will want to send somebody up for closer look we may have real ufo on our hands the alert sounds fighter is scrambled and we get shot of the uss enterprise flying across the blue sky captain log stardate 3113 we were en-route to starbase for resupply when black star of high gravitational attraction began to drag us toward it it required all warp power in reverse to pull us away from the star but like snapping rubber band the breakaway sent us plunging through space out of control to stop here wherever we are the crew are picking themselves and their chairs up off the floor
mister spock
except for secondary systems everything is out sir we re on impulse power only
auxiliaries
if mister scott is still with us auxiliaries should be on momentarily uhura is just stirring on the floor are you all right lieutenant he helps her back to her seat and the lights come on
mister scott is still with us
this is the captain damage control parties on all decks check in all departments tie in with the record computer report casualties and operational readiness to the first officer kirk out lieutenant uhura contact starfleet control want them alerted to the position of that black star that in the area of starbase
yes sir
captain casualty reports indicate only minor injuries engineering reports warp engines non-operational mister scott overrode the automatic helm setting and is holding us in orbit on impulse power
orbit where
earth captain we were on general course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star apparently the breakaway threw us on in the same direction
screen on full view of north america is on screen with not cloud in sight
we are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit captain engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape velocity
give us some altitude mister sulu
yes sir helm answering she sluggish sir
captain normal starfleet channel has nothing but static getting something on another frequency but it not starfleet
put it on audio manned moon shot is scheduled for wednesday six am eastern standard time all three astronauts who are to make this historic kirk signals it cut off
manned moon shot that was in the late 1960s
apparently captain so are we
what
whiplash propelled us into time warp captain backward exact chronometer readings in few moments
captain getting ground to air transmission
verified scanners report some type of craft approaching from below us under cloud cover and closing tracking you and the ufo
have him on my screen following
mister sulu can you gain altitude faster want to outdistance him
picking up sir but she still slow in responding
blackjack this is bluejay ufo is picking up speed and climbing going in closer
can see it now whatever this is it big two cylindrical projections on top one below purpose undetermined rendezvous in your sector in two minutes
won be here the ufo climbing away fast the ufo and attempt to force him to land we want it brought down or at least disabled until the other planes arrive
positive identification captain aircraft is an interceptor equipped with missiles possibly armed with nuclear warheads if he hits us with one he might damage us severely perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances
scotty activate tractor beam lock onto that aircraft and hold it out there
captain this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our tractor beam the bright light of the tractor beam forces captain christopher to lower his visor
aircraft is breaking up captain kirk; transporter room can you lock onto the cockpit of that aircraft
scanning area sir
try and beam that pilot aboard take over mister spock from his seated position strapped into his fighter captain christopher is beamed aboard standing up
welcome aboard the enterprise
you speak english
that right you can step off the transporter
captain john christopher united states air force serial number 4857932
relax captain you re among friends captain james kirk
what going on here where am what happened you people who are you
all in good time captain meanwhile let me apologise for bringing you aboard the ship so abruptly but it couldn be helped didn know that your craft couldn stand up to our tractor beam
don give me any double-talk just tell me who you are
we ll tell you what we decide to tell you in few moments in the meantime relax you re our guest have feeling you ll find it interesting
kirk here what is it mister spock turn off the tractor beam
affirmative we have the pilot aboard ll be right up kirk out follow me
good morning captain
morning drags christopher along captain
woman
crewman
bridge
must have taken quite lot to build ship like this
there are only twelve like it in the fleet
see did the navy
we re combined service captain our authority is the united earth space probe agency
united earth
this is very difficult to explain we re from your future time warp placed us here it was an accident
you seem to have lot of them however can deny the fact that you re here with this ship
never have believed in little green men
neither have
captain christopher this is my first officer lieutenant commander spock
captain
feel free to look around captain don touch anything but think you ll find it interesting
interesting is word and half for it captain
we ve achieved stable orbit out of earth atmosphere our deflectors are operative enough to prevent our being picked up again as ufo and mister scott wishes to speak to you about the engines
very well mister spock anything else on your mind
captain christopher
what about him
we cannot return him to earth captain he already knows too much about us and is learning more do not specifically refer to captain christopher but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man future such man could manipulate key industries stocks and even nations and in so doing change what must be and if it is changed captain you and and all that we know might not even exist
your logic can be most annoying goes over to christopher who is talking to uhura
that flight suit must be uncomfortable to spock why don you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable then want to meet you and him in my quarters
yes sir
computer on record
in low breathy voice recording
come spock enters with christopher who is now dressed in command gold
captain log supplemental engineering officer scott informs warp engines damaged but can be made operational and reenergised
computed and recorded dear
computer you will not address me in that manner compute
computed dear
mister spock ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired
have investigated it captain to correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and minimum of three weeks at starbase
wouldn mind so much if it didn get so affectionate
it also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle
take it that lady computer is not routine
we put in at cygnet fourteen for general repair and maintenance cygnet fourteen is planet dominated by women they seemed to feel the ship computer system lacked personality they gave it one female of course
well you people certainly have interesting problems love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out butÂ 
afraid you ll have to we can send you back
can spock here told me that your transporter can beam down an object even from an orbit this high
it not the transporter it you you know what the future looks like if anybody else finds out they could change the course of it destroy it
well then my disappearance would change something too
have run computer check on all historical tapes they show no record of any relevant contribution by john christopher
look captain don buy all your time accident story the experts can figure out who you are and what you are it my duty to report what ve seen well what would you do
report if could we can take the risk
don want to know about risks have wife two children what about them
sorry
kirk here
progress report sir everything jury-rigged but we re coming along with the repairs we could re-energise in about four hours but
but what scotty
well sir as say the engines are being repaired but we ve no place to go in this time if you if you see what mean
yes scotty carry on
too bad captain maybe can go home but neither can you you re as much prisoner in time as am captain log stardate 3113 our engines are being repaired but we are still locked in time and we have aboard passenger whom we do not want and we cannot return
recommendation for his disposition dear
maintenance note my recording computer has serious malfunction recommend it either be corrected or scrapped compute
petulant computed
kirk here important see you both immediately
yes mister spock report to my quarters ll contact captain christopher
captain christopher captain christopher security this is the captain kirk; all decks alert captain christopher is not in his assigned quarters he may be trying to escape the ship want man outside the transporter room immediately heading there myself christopher gets the jump on hapless red-shirt and takes his phaser then steps into
all right nice and easy now going to step into that thing and you re going to transport me back to earth he hears noise behind him and turns to have kirk disarm him and knock him out
well jim with the exception of slight bruise or two our captain is as healthy as proverbial horse he ll be coming out of it in minute or two
he tried to escape know how he feels but can send him back with what he knows
jim what if we can go back what do we do sit up here and wait for our supplies to run out our power to die it has to eventually you know we certainly can go back to earth it would be worse than the captain being returned there are four hundred and thirty of us and that means four hundred and thirty chances of altering the future
yes but we re not in that position yet
glad to hear it
and if we do get back to where we belong then he won belong we re roughly about the same age but in our society he be useless archaic
maybe he could be retrained reeducated
now you re sounding like spock
if you re going to get nasty going to leave
could he be retrained to forget his family his children
the answer to that is no
you all right
yeah see physical training is required in your service too
crude methods but effective
what does he mean by that
it just joke captain
you said you had some additional information mister spock
made an error in my computations
oh this could be an historic occasion
find that we must return captain christopher to earth after all
why you said made no relative contribution
poor choice of words on my part neglected in my initial run-through to correlate the possible contributions by offspring find after running crosscheck on that factor that your son colonel shaun geoffrey christopher headed or will head the first successful earth-saturn probe which is rather significant
wait minute don have son
you mean yet
the doctor is correct unless we return captain christopher to earth there will be no colonel shaun geoffrey christopher to go to saturn
well that it isn it we ll have to find some way of
boy going to have son
acknowledging that we must return captain christopher there are several problems prime of which is the explanation of his return we tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it it crashed in an open section of southern nebraska
that means those search parties will be crawling all over that wreckage
and captain christopher himself complicated the matter
when made visual contact turned on my wing cameras got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures of you air defence command will be processing that film fast and adc control was probably recording my radio transmissions
if remember my history these things were being dismissed as weather balloons sun dogs explainable things at least publicly
captain our tractor beam caught and crushed an air force plane it ll be impossible to explain this as anything other than genuine ufo possibly alien definitely destructive
what about our problem mister spock any ideas on how to get us back to our own time
theory reverse application of what happened to us logically it could work also logically there are hundred variables any one of which could put us in worse position than we re in now
we re going to have to go back and get those reports and photos if the captain feels duty bound to report what he saw there won be any evidence to support him
that makes me out to be either liar or fool
perhaps
not at all you ll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw ufo
captain know that base was stationed there year ago like to
no captain thank you but if anything should go wrong you might get hurt we couldn risk that neither could you or your son
well like to help could sketch layout of the place for you show you where the record section and the photo lab are kirk hands him padd it nighttime and guard is patrolling the corridors when kirk and sulu beam in they smile at the quaint notice board and trophy cupboard before breaking into the statistical services division by means of sort of sonic screwdriver kirk torch lights up bank of magnetic tapes
primitive computer ve seen them demonstrated in museums
me too if this one like those it ll make the devil noise if you start it
don intend to start it
how long have they been down there now
fifteen minutes twenty eight seconds
well shouldn they be coming up
it is fact doctor that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than direct approach in our case
shouldn you be working on your time warp calculations mister spock
am they ve just taken the magnetic tape when the lights go on and an armed guard confronts them
hold it get your hands up now one at time hand me those belts they hand over the belts with the phasers attached to them
and the bag
it been too long jim should have at least signaled by now
you may be correct doctor open communicator channel there beeping sound
what was that
what was what
that noise
didn hear anything
that noise it coming from one of these things he has communicator in his hand so he puts down the bag and belts and opens it
the emergency signal
stay right where you are
one emergency signal sir
beam up immediately
only one signal what happened
we ll know in moment doctor the sergeant is beamed aboard
spock here are you all right captain
yes all right but as you can see we have another problem captain log stardate 3113 first officer spock recording due to an unfortunate accident we have taken aboard another unwanted passenger
your surprise package is an air police sergeant from the base transporter room no sense in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary
don believe there ll be trouble in that respect captain the sergeant still hasn hardly moved muscle when mccoy gently takes the gun and communicator out of his hands
our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is
kirk out returns to the magnetic tapes what was the chronometer reading when we first sighted christopher jet
five thirty in that time zone maybe little after
put it at the end of these tapes will you get them all they leave the room and head off down the corridor to the photo section
we ll try the darkroom on the monitor board light flashes on the board indicating someone has entered the photo section
photo lab kirk is checking reels of film
yes that it that all of them signal mister spock that we re almost ready to beam up ll make check of the files just in case
yes sir kirk walks out into the main lab just as security walk in he shuts the door behind him and fights the three men making lots of noise so sulu can hear what is going on he eventually restrained and the colonel takes look in the dark room it empty
all right where the other one
what other one
your partner saw you looking that was and saw somebody move in there
no no no just me besides could anyone get out of here without your seeing them
no nobody should have been able to
your decision to beam up was quite correct mister sulu
spock here re-fire them anytime
do so now engineer we ll need all power to test our theory
examining roll of film poor photography
blast your theories and observations mister spock what about jim he down there alone probably under arrest he doesn have communicator and we can locate him or beam him back aboard without one
am aware of that doctor this is the first officer captain christopher to the briefing room
now look mister you and had better start communicating want to know how you got in here that simple question give me simple answer nobody saw you you got all the way inside without tripping any alarm how did you do it
believe me colonel you wouldn believe me
don try to be funny how did you get in
popped in out of thin air
you seem to think this is some kind of game
no colonel know it no game
all right what did you say your name was
for the fourth time my name is james kirk
and how did you get inside top security installation james kirk
told you you wouldn believe me the colonel picks up the communicator
colonel would you mind being careful with that
that worries you little bit huh what is that radio transmitter of some kind
of some kind
you can be more specific than that kirk don like mysteries
if you don stop being careless with that you ll have one big one
ll have it disassembled and examined we are not dummies mister we know how to find out things we want to know tosses it to the guard standing nearby what is that is that uniform of some kind
this little thing just something slipped on
kirk maybe you don realise how serious this is sabotage of government installation
did sabotage something
no we stopped you in time but what would you have done if we hadn found you
believe me colonel nothing at all
is that what you re here for nothing at all
that what would have happened if you hadn interfered
all right kirk maybe this will make you laugh sabotage espionage unauthorised entry burglary how are those for starters and can think up lots more if you don start talking
all right colonel the truth is little green man from alpha centauri beautiful place you ought to see it
am going to lock you up for two hundred years
that ought to be just about right
he probably being held in security section even if they ve notified the authorities it ll take little time for someone to get there
quite logical captain can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down landing party near those interrogation rooms
yes but you re not going to get them unless you take me with you
can do that captain
if something went wrong
something already gone wrong of course you could beam down anywhere inside that base but it would take time to find him
mister sulu you and captain christopher will beam down with me the captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief
shall issue phasers
one for you one for me set them on heavy stun force
yes sir leaves
you don trust me spock
in fact do but only to certain point
energise the party are beamed down
do they do that all the time
are you hungry
uh-huh
what would you like
maybe some chicken soup kyle puts card in the slot and the hatch slides up to reveal bowl on tray the sergeant dips his finger in to taste it
it is captain christopher walks past the guard on duty
just minute sir hold it sulu karate-chops him into unconsciousness there knock at the door
see what that is airman it spock who neck-pinches the hapless airman kirk punches lt colonel fellini lights out
don you find that painful captain
yes do what he doing here
he knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the base it was necessary to bring him along
see no harm done mister sulu did you check out those tapes
mister spock ran them through they were the right ones we got them all spock goes into the colonel office
they know you ve been here
all they have is mystery and no answers mister sulu signal the transporter chief four to beam up
yes sir
holding the security guard gun uh-uh not me
don be fool you know what at stake
you bet do my family son that isn born yet you don have to return me now captain spock come out of there
you can explain your presence on the base
told you it my duty to report everything ve seen that explanation enough spock
you ll go home christopher but you ll do it our way spock appears in the doorway behind christopher
over my dead body so he gets neck-pinched into unconsciousness
suspected he might not wish to return with us
four to beam up mister sulu
yes sir captain log stardate 3114 we must make an attempt to break free of this time or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners all we have is theory and few facts
mister scott and both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect like the one that put us here my computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun seek out its magnetic attraction then pull away at full power the whiplash will propel us into another time warp
slingshot effects are fine for you people how do you propose to return the sergeant and me
logically as we move faster and faster toward the sun we ll begin to move backward in time we ll actually go back beyond yesterday beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky then breaking free will shoot us forward in time and we ll transport you back before any of this happened
you won have anything to remember because it never would have happened
what if you can pull free of the sun
oh we ll do that all right captain we ll not be getting so close that my engines couldn pull us out what am worried about sir that we may not have much control when we re thrown forward again
helm control
braking control sir if can stop us soon enough we may overshoot our time and if stop the engines suddenly the strain may tear us apart anyway we do it it mighty rough ride
well gentlemen we all have to take chance especially if one is all you have assume your stations enterprise leaves orbit and we watch the pretty blue and white globe receding on the viewscreen
ahead warp factor three mister sulu
warp factor three sir
never thought make it into space was in line to be chosen for the space programme but didn qualify
take good look around captain you made it here ahead of all of them
sir our speed is increasing we re travelling at over warp eight
mister spock
since we ve passed mercury the sun pull on us has increased greatly from here we ll move even faster and captain notice the chronometers they ve started backward minute by minute the speed of time passage will now increase
get your gear report to the transporter room and captain christopher you only have about fifteen years so you better hurry christopher leaves and time passes
approaching breakaway point on the countdown ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
now mister sulu the ship lurches sideways more power mister sulu
it maximum now sir she fighting it then everyone thrown forward
we ve broken free and heading back
gaining speed now captain we re now at warp four warp seven eight off the dial sir
chronometers moving forward again captain
do you have the chronometer reading and the co-ordinates to return captain christopher and the guard
computed
bridge to transporter room captain christopher
this is christopher
we re coming up on earth fast captain are you ready
captain thanks for the look ahead
our pleasure captain bridge out the blue planet grows larger on the viewscreen
twenty minutes sir it ll be close
bridge to transporter room prepare to energise
ten minutes nine eight seven six five four three two one
energise
you should be close enough for visual contact captain christopher is beamed into himself he has look around but enterprise has vanished
bluejay four can you see it what is it bluejay come in we ve lost the image
blackjack this is bluejay four could have sworn there was some kind of ship but nothing could have moved that fast
we don track mirages bluejay four returning to base out
approaching second beaming captain
bridge to transporter room prepare to energise
now
energise the sergeant is beamed into himself as he is about to look through the glass door of the statistical services division there no one there so he continues on his round
past pluto sir
what our reading mister spock
approaching our century captain braking should begin now
bridge to engineering begin full braking power
pulling away from the sun weakened them sir they may blow apart if reverse
no choice mister scott
aye sir
fifty years to go
engines cutting back sir no decrease in speed
forty thirty
never mind mister spock once again everyone gets thrown around
the engines
engine room to bridge engines are on full reverse they re buckling bridge things return to normal
mister scott is still with us
captain enterprise
open channel uhura
frequency open sir
starfleet control this is the enterprise captain kirk speaking
record ship arrival dear
starfleet control repeating message the enterprise is home kirk out
check the circuit
all operating sir
it can be the screen then definitely something out there captain headed this way
it could be these meteorites
no it something else there still something out there
it coming at the speed of light collision course the meteorite beam has not deflected it captain
evasive manoeuvres sir
steady as we go
it radio wave sir we re passing through an old-style distress signal
they were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way
ship in trouble making forced landing sir that it no other message
have fix it comes from the talos star group
we ve no ships or earth colonies that far out
their call letters check with survey expedition ss columbia it disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago
it would take that long for radio beam to travel from there to here
records show the talos group has never been explored solar system similar to earth eleven planets number four seems to be class oxygen atmosphere
then they could still be alive even after eighteen years
if they survived the crash
we aren going to go to be certain
not without any indication of survivors no continue to the vega colony and take care of our own sick and injured first you have the helm maintain present course
yes sir
drop by my cabin doctor boyce enters with bag what that didn say there anything wrong with me
understand we picked up distress signal
that right unless we get anything more positive on it it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent like to log the ship doctor opinion too
oh concur with yours definitely
good glad you do because we re going to stop first at the vega colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also what the devil are you putting in there ice
who wants warm martini
what makes you think need one
sometimes man ll tell his bartender things he ll never tell his doctor what been on your mind chris the fight on rigel seven
shouldn it be my only yeoman and two others dead seven injured
was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it
oh should have smelled trouble when saw the swords and the armour instead of that let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors
chris you set standards for yourself no one could meet you treat everyone on board like human being except yourself and now you re tired and you
you bet tired you bet tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn and who going on the landing party and who doesn and who lives and who dies boy ve had it phil
to the point of finally taking my advice rest leave
to the point of considering resigning
and do what
well for one thing go home nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it remember told you had two horses and we used to take some food and ride out all day
ah that sounds exciting ride out with picnic lunch every day
said that one place might go might go into business on regulus or on the orion colony
you an orion trader dealing in green animal women slaves
the point is this isn the only life available there whole galaxy of things to choose from
not for you man either lives life as it happens to him meets it head-on and licks it or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away
now you re beginning to talk like doctor bartender
take your choice we both get the same two kinds of customers the living and the dying message sir there are crash survivors on talos
reads eleven survivors from crash gravity and oxygen within limits food and water obtainable but unless the message faded at that point sir
address intercraft
system open
this is the captain our destination is the talos star group our time warp factor seven
course computed and on the screen
all decks have acknowledged sir
engage
on course sir colt enters pike turns around and bumps into her
yeoman
yes sir
thought told you that when on the bridge
but you wanted the reports by oh five hundred it oh five hundred now sir
oh see thank you
she replacing your former yeoman sir
she does good job all right it just that can get used to having woman on the bridge no offence lieutenant you re different of course the enterprise arrives at planet
we ve settled into orbit sir
geological lab report complete captain
preliminary lab survey ready sir
spectography
our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere sir heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits
gravity
zero point nine of earth
captain reflections sir from the planet surface as read it they polarise out as rounded metal bits could be parts of spaceship hull
prep landing party of six you feel up to it
yes sir
yes sir
sorry number one with little information on this planet we ll have to leave the ship most experienced officer here covering us
of course sir
there no indication of problems down there but let not take chances
yes sir there canyon to the left we can set you there completely unobserved the group explores until they find rough settlement
sir
they re men they re humans
captain christopher pike united space ship enterprise
doctor theodore haskins american continent lnstitute
is earth all right
the same old earth and you ll see it very soon
and you won believe how fast you can get back well the time barrier been broken our new ships can he struck dumb by the sight of lovely young woman
this is vina her parents are dead she was born almost as we crashed the reunion is being watched on another screen by three people with big bald heads
as the survivors pack up the settlement enterprise
we ll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly out scouting and scientific parties now
that affirmative on the
you appear to be healthy and intelligent captain prime specimen
er affirmative on request landing party out
you must forgive her choice of words captain she lived her whole life with collection of aging scientists
if they can spare you moment like to make my medical report
think it time to show the captain our secret
their health is excellent almost too good
there reason for our condition but we ve had some doubt if earth is ready to learn the secret let the girl show you we ll accept your judgment pike follows vina up slope to ledge by rock face
you re tired but don worry you ll feel much better soon don you see it here and here
don understand
you will you re perfect choice vina vanishes and so do all the survivors and their encampment door opens in the rock face pike is knocked out and taken inside at the settlement
captain everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock they fire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to show the metal underneath
spock here
there is no survivors encampment number one this is all some sort of trap we ve lost the captain do you read pike wakes to find himself in cell with transparent wall blocking his escape he tests it strength and notices other similar occupied cells there fanged ape giant bird and other scary shadows the three aliens arrive
can you hear me my name is christopher pike commander of the space vehicle enterprise from stellar group at the other end of this galaxy our intentions are peaceful can you understand me the aliens communicate with their minds not voices
it appears magistrate that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited
this is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with simulated message as you can read in its thoughts it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were simple illusion we placed in their minds
you re not speaking yet can hear you
you will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions
all right then telepathy you can read my mind can read yours now unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act
you now see the primitive fear threat reaction the specimen is about to boast of his strength the weaponry of his vessel and so on next frustrated into need to display physical prowess the creature will throw himself against the transparency
if you were in here wouldn you test the strength of these walls too there way out of any cage and ll find it
despite its frustration the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets we can soon begin the experiment
the inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground and probably manufacture food and other needs down there our tests indicate the planet surface without considerably more vegetation or some animals simply too barren to support life
so we just thought we saw survivors there mister spock
exactly an illusion placed in our minds by this planet inhabitants
it was perfect illusion they had us seeing just what we wanted to see human beings who survived with dignity and bravery everything entirely logical right down to the building of the camp the tattered clothing everything now let be sure we understand the danger of this the inhabitants of this planet can read our minds they can create illusions out of person own thoughts memories and experiences even out of person own desires illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore
any estimate what they might want one of us for
they may simply be studying the captain to find out how earth people are put together or it could be something more
then why aren we doing anything that entry may have stood up against hand lasers but we can transmit the ship power against it enough to blast half continent
look brains three times the size of ours if we start buzzing about down there we re liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were fly
it captain pike they ve got he needs help and he probably
engineering deck will rig to transmit ship power we ll try blasting through that metal as pike continues to explore his cell
thousands of us are already probing the creature thoughts magistrate we find excellent memory capacity
read most strongly recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life we will begin with this giving the specimen something more interesting to protect
come on we must hide ourselves come come hurry it deserted there ll be weapons and perhaps food
this is rigel seven
please we must hide ourselves
was in cage cell in some kind of zoo must still be there
come on
they ve reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere ve been
the killer
it starting just as it happened two weeks ago except for you the courtyard is scattered with lances and spears
longer hair different dress but it is you the one the survivors called vina or rather the image of vina but why you again why didn they create different girl the killer enters big humanoid with shield and axe
quick if you attack while it not looking
but it only dream
you have to kill him as you did here before
you can tell my jailers won go along with it not an animal performing for its supper
it doesn matter what you call this you ll feel it that what matters you ll feel every moment of whatever happens to you please don you know what he ll do to us so pike fights the killer with mace and shield
why would an illusion be frightened
because that the way you imagined me
who are you you act as if this were really you
careful pike and vina retreat up some stairs the killer breaks pike spear and they throw objects at it pike gets knocked down into the courtyard the killer grabs vina and pike throws spear into it back then it jumps down and spears itself on wicked harpoon that pike grabs just in time
it over vina hugs her hero then sees the talosians watching them the talosians leave
why are you here
to please you
are you real
as real as you wish
no no no that not an answer ve never met you before never even imagined you
perhaps they made me out of dreams you ve forgotten
what and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear
have to wear something don can wear whatever you wish be anything you wish
so they can see how their specimen performs they want to see how react is that it
don you have dream something you ve always wanted very badly
or do they do more than just watch me do they feel with me too
you can have whatever dream you want can become anything any woman you ve ever imagined you can have anything you want in the whole universe let me please you
yes yes you can please me you can tell me about them is there any way can keep them from probing my mind from using my thoughts against me does that frighten you does that mean there is way
you re fool
since you re not real there not much point in continuing this conversation is there big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the rock
all circuits engaged mister spock
take cover the laser cannon blasts away
increase to full power can you give us any more power
disengage the top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second
maybe it was it what tried to explain in the briefing room their power of illusion is so great we can be sure of anything we do anything we see
perhaps if you asked me some questions could answer
how far can they control my mind
if tell you then will you pick some dream you ve had and let me live it with you
perhaps
they can actually make you do anything you don want to do
but they try to trick me with their illusions
and they can punish you when you re not co-operative you ll find out about that
did they ever live on the surface of this planet why did they go underground
war thousands of centuries ago
that why it so barren up there vina; the planet only now becoming able to support life again
so the talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power
but they found it trap like narcotic because when dreams become more important than reality you give up travel building creating you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors you just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record
or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me
you re better than theatre to them they create the illusion for you they watch you react feel your emotions they have whole collection of specimens descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy
which means they had to have more than one of each animal
please
they ll need pair of humans too where do they get intend to get the earth woman
you said that if answered questions
but that was bargain with something that didn exist you said you weren real remember
woman as real and as human as you are we re like adam and eve if we don please don punish me disappears pike sees the magistrate walk away pike continues to search the walls for door when hatch opens and glass is placed on the floor
the vial contains nourishing protein complex
is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals
if the form and the colour is not appealing it can appear as any food you wish to visualise
and if prefer
to starve you overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone screaming in pain
from fable you once heard in childhood you will now consume the nourishment
why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind because you can can you you do have limitations don you
if you continue to disobey from deeper in your mind there are things even more unpleasant pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall the magistrate steps back in surprise
that very interesting
now to the female
you were startled weren you reading my mind then
as you ve conjectured an earth vessel did crash on our planet but with only single survivor
no let stay on the first subject all wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck
we repaired the survivor injuries and found the species interesting
do primitive thoughts put up block you can read through
it became necessary to attract mate
all right all right let talk about the girl you seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive to make me feel protective
this is necessary in order to perpetuate the species
it seems more important to you now that begin to accept her and like her
we wish our specimens to be happy in their new life
assuming that lie why would you want me attracted to her so ll feel love in husband-wife relationship that would be necessary only if you intend to build family group or perhaps whole human community
with the female now properly conditioned
you mean properly punished the one who not co-operating why don you punish me
first an emotion of protectiveness now one of sympathy excellent picnic spread on tartan rug two horses standing by futuristic city in the distance
you want some coffee dear left the thermos hooked to my saddle
tango you old devil you sorry don have any sugar well they think of everything don they feeds lumps to the horse
hey your coffee is it good to be home
they read our minds very well home anything else want if co-operate is that it
have you forgotten my headaches darling get them when you talk strangely like this
look sorry they punish you but we can let them
my it turned out to be lovely day didn it
it funny it about twenty four hours ago was telling the ship doctor how much wanted something else not very different from what we have here an escape from reality life with no frustrations no responsibilities now that have it understand the doctor answer
hope you re hungry these little white sandwiches are your mother recipe for chicken tuna
you either live life bruises skinned knees and all or you turn your back on it and start dying the doctor going to be happy about one part at least he said needed rest
this is lovely place to rest
used to ride through here when was kid it not as pretty as some of the parkland around the big cities but that mojave that where was born
is that supposed to be news to your wife you re home you can even stay if you want wouldn it be nice showing your children where you once played
these headaches they ll be hereditary you know would you wish them on child or whole group of children
foolish
is it look first they made me protect you and then feel sympathy for you now we have these familiar surroundings and comfortable husband-wife relationship they don need all this for just passion what they re after is respect and mutual dependence
they say in the olden days all this was desert blowing sand and cactus
but we re not here neither of us we re in menagerie cage
no pike; can help either one of us if you won give me chance now you told me once they used illusions as narcotic they couldn repair the machines left by their ancestors is that why they want us to build colony of slaves
stop it don you care what they ll do to us
back in my cage it seemed for couple of minutes that our keeper couldn read my thoughts do emotions like hate keeping hate in your mind does that block off our mind from them
yes they can read through primitive emotions but you can keep it up for long enough ve tried they keep at you and at you year after year tricking and punishing and they won they own me know you must hate me for that
oh no don hate you can guess what it was like
but that not enough don you see they read my thoughts my feelings my dreams of what would be perfect man that why they picked you can help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way
if they can read my mind then they know attracted to you saw you in the survivor camp
curious species they have fantasies they hide even from themselves you you ve been home and fighting as on rigel that not new to you either person strongest dreams are about what he can do yes ship captain always having to be so formal so decent and honest and proper you must wonder what it would be like to forget all that band plays and green woman dances sensuously
nice place you have here mister pike the dancer is
vina
glistening green almost like secret dreams bored ship captain might have
funny how they are on this planet they actually like being taken advantage of suppose you had all of space to choose from and this was only one small sample
wouldn you say it was worth man soul pike gets up and leaves the door he walks through turns into rock wall then vina is there holding blazing torch
we ve located magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator
could that be an illusion too
now you all know the situation we re hoping to transport down inside the talosian community
if our measurements and readings are an illusion also one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock
nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out pitcairn energises but only number one and yeoman colt dematerialise
the women
captain captain
no let me finish
but we were party of six
we were the only ones transported
it not fair you don need them
grabbing colt laser pistol they don work
they were fully charged when we left it dead communicator can make signal what is it
don say anything filling my mind with picture of beating their huge misshapen heads to pulp thoughts so primitive they black out everything else filling my mind with hate
how long can you block your thoughts few minutes an hour how can that help
leave him alone
he doesn need you he already picked me
picked her for what don understand
now there fine choice for intelligent offspring
offspring as in children
offspring as in he adam is that it
you re no better choice they have more luck crossing him with computer
well shall we do little time computation there was vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman now adding eighteen years to your age then the magistrate approaches the cell
it not fair did what you asked
since you resist the present specimen you now have selection
ll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you is your blood red like ours going to find out
each of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour the female you call number one has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children although she seems to lack emotion this is largely pretence she has often has fantasies involving you
all want to do is get my hands on you can you read these thoughts images of hate killing
the other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed the factors in her favour are youth and strength plus unusually strong female drives
you ll find my thoughts more interesting thoughts so primitive you can understand emotions so ugly stricken by pain
wrong thinking is punishable right thinking will be as quickly rewarded you will find it an effective combination magistrate leaves
captain
no no don help me have to concentrate they can read through hate
address intercraft
open sir
this is the acting captain speaking we have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew we re leaving all decks prepare for hyperdrive time warp factor
mister spock the ship controls have gone dead the lights go out
engine room
open
mister spock here switch to rockets we re blasting out
there nothing every system aboard is fading out the group are apparently dozing when the magistrate opens the hatch to get the laser pistols pike dropped there he grabs him and pulls him into the cage and starts to throttle him
now you hold still or ll break your neck
don hurt them they don mean to be evil
ve had some samples of how good they are the talosian appears to be vicious monster
you stop this illusion or ll twist your head off it stops all right now you try one more illusion you try anything at all and ll break your neck
your ship release me or we ll destroy it the senior officers have taken the navigation console apart
nothing but for the batteries we lose gravitation and oxygen
the computers the monitor shows montage of images space capsules the moon maps of earth
can shut it off it running through our library tapes micro-records everything it doesn make sense
could be we ve waited too long it collecting all the information stored in this fly they ve decided to swat us
he not bluffing captain with illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship
going to gamble you re too intelligent to kill for no reason at all pike hands the magistrate over to number one and picks up the laser pistols firing them at the glass wall then he puts one to the magistrate head
on the other hand ve got reason willing to bet you ve created an illusion this laser is empty think it just blasted hole in that window and you re keep us from seeing it you want me to test my theory out on your head there is hole in the window
captain they all leave through the hole and get into the elevator to the surface the top of the rocky knoll is split apart
make contact number one
they kept us from seeing this too we cut through and never knew it captain the communicator isn working
as you see your attempt to escape accomplished nothing
want to contact our ship
you are now on the surface where we wished you to be with the female of your choice you will now begin carefully guided lives
and start by burying you
that is your choice to help you reclaim the planet surface our zoological gardens will furnish variety of plant life
look ll make deal with you you and your life for the lives of these two earth women
since our lifespan is many times yours we have time to evolve you into society trained to serve as artisans technicians
do you understand what saying you give me proof that our ship is all right send these two back and ll stay with vina number one sets her laser pistol to overload
it wrong to create whole race of humans to live as slaves
is this deception do you intend to destroy yourselves
what is that
the weapon is building up an overload force chamber explosion you still have time to get underground well go on pushes vina away just to show you how primitive humans are talosian you go with her
if if you all think it this important then can go either suppose if they have one human being they might try again more talosians arrive
wait number one turns off the pistol
their method of storing records is crude and consumed much time are you prepared to assimilate it the magistrate nods and the veins on his head throb
we had not believed this possible the customs and history of your race show unique hatred of captivity even when it pleasant and benevolent you prefer death this makes you too violent and dangerous species for our needs
he means that they can use you you re free to go back to the ship
and that it no apologies you captured one of us threatened all of us
your unsuitability has condemned the talosian race to eventual death is this not sufficient
no other specimen has shown your adaptability you were our last hope
but wouldn some form of trade mutual co-operation
your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself too
captain we have transporter control now
let get back to the ship
can can go with you
sir it just came on we can shut the power off
mister spock here to control the transporter platforms light up and first colt then number one are beamed aboard
the captain vina changes into scarred misshapen older woman
you see why can go with you
this is the female true appearance
they found me in the wreckage dying lump of flesh they rebuilt me everything works but they had never seen human they had no guide for putting me back together
it was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one
you ll give her back her illusion of beauty
and more beautiful vina and happy pike go up the slope and into the elevator
she has an illusion and you have reality may you find your way as pleasant
mister spock the system is coming on again pike is beamed aboard
what happened to vina
isn she coming with us
no no and agreed with her reasons pike number one and spock enter
hold on minute
oh feel fine just fine
you look hundred percent better
you recommended rest change of pace didn you ve even been home does that make you happy he bumps into colt again
yeoman
yes sir
thought told you that when on the bridge she hands him clip-board stuffed with papers for his signature
oh oh yes the reports thank you
sir was wondering just curious who would have been eve
yeoman you ve delivered your report
yes ma am yes sir
eve sir yes sir
eve as in adam
as in all ship doctors are dirty old men what are we running here cadet ship number one are we ready or not
all decks show ready sir
engage
welcome to starbase eleven captain the commodore waiting to see you he curious why you suddenly changed course and came here
we received subspace message asking us to divert here immediately
this base sent no message captain
oh jim just can understand this
mister spock received starbase transmission message from the former commander of the enterprise fleet captain pike urgently requesting that we divert here
impossible
if my first officer states he received transmission from
jim not doubting anyone word simply telling you it impossible
why
you don know you actually don know what happened to captain pike there been subspace chatter about it for months sorry to have to be the one to show you he upstairs in the medical section
you ever met chris pike
when he was promoted to fleet captain
about your age big handsome man vital active
took over the enterprise from him spock served with him for several years
eleven years four months five days
what his problem commodore
inspection tour of cadet vessel old class starship one of the baffle plates ruptured
the delta rays
he went in bringing out all those kids that were still alive just wanted you gentlemen to be prepared
captain pike scarred head and shoulders sticking out of wheelchair device captain you remember these gentlemen they wanted to visit you two flashes mean no thought you might make an exception for them flash flash sorry gentlemen
chris if there anything can do for you flash flash
captain pike may remain for moment flash the others leave you know why ve come captain it only six days away at maximum warp and have it well-planned flash flash have never disobeyed your orders before captain but this time must flash flash know know it is treachery and it mutiny but must do this flash flash have no choice flash flash
once more jose spock stated he received message for us to come here he entered same in his log that all the proof require
and what do those record tapes show no message sent from here no message received by your vessel
then suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed computer expert can change record tapes duplicate voices say anything say nothing
the fact remains that your first officer former captain is hospitalised horribly injured at this base and that same first officer seems to be the only one who heard that message
if he had wanted to see captain pike he could have requested leave would have granted it
well that true of course
who would want to divert us here there no trouble in the space sector we re patrolling now no alien problems
computer centre
chief humboldt here sir question
yes sir from here without us knowing it
negative commodore we ve checked and double-checked everything possible spock creeps up behind humboldt and neck-pinches him then does something to the innards of computer bank
oh have introduced miss piper jim this is captain kirk miss piper
recognized the captain immediately mutual friend described you sir lieutenant helen johansson
helen described
she merely mentioned she knew you sir
you have something to report miss piper
oh yes sir afraid our investigation turned up very little commodore there is of course mister spock years of service with captain pike indications of his extreme loyalty to this former commander
miss piper vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist without breathing that goes for his present commander as well as his past
we re forced to consider every possibility sir we can be certain captain pike cannot have sent message in his condition he under observation every minute of every day
and totally unable to move jim his wheel chair is constructed to respond to his brain waves oh he can turn it move it forwards or backwards slightly
with the flashing light he can say yes or no
but that it jim that as much as that poor devil can do his mind is as active as yours and mine but it trapped inside useless vegetating body he kept alive mechanically battery-driven heart
there no way he could even have asked for that message to be sent starbase operations spock adjusts it to sound normal starbase operations starbase operations enterprise standby to receive new orders enterprise
starbase operation mister hansen orders they re to be fed directly into the ship computers this is top secret and scrambled
enterprise standing by request confirmation
enterprise to starbase request confirmation
sir this is security area what are you doing here
have security clearance chief
who gave you clearance haven been notified you re cross-circuiting the struggle whose tapes are these operating confirmation from the ship captain spock pinches the chief unconscious
come in starbase come in captain kirk spock inserts data chip
hansen here captain into ship computers er how can handle the helm if don know where we re going all questions kirk out
this is mister spock helm on this voyage mister hansen course will be computed and set automatically
you will not discuss this with ship crew or starbase personnel do you read
acknowledged sir
stand by we ll warp out of orbit in one hour
watching pike on monitor he keeps blinking no no to what
they ve tried questioning him he almost agitated himself into coma
how long will he live
as long as any of us blast medicine anyway we ve learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one the brain the brain is what life is all about now that man can think any thought that we can and love hope dream as much as we can but he can reach out and no one can reach in
he keeps blinking no
no to what they could question him for days weeks before they stumble on the right thing
bones could this have anything to do with spock
don read you at all jim
what mean is either message was received it was one of two things either someone sent message diverting us here or someone on board the ship lied about receiving it could that someone be mister spock
jim forgetting how well we both know spock the simple fact that he vulcan means he incapable of telling lie
he also half human
and that half is completely submerged to be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him
someone interfering with my command and my ship don know who it is but mean to find out even you if thought you had the technical know-how suspect you but you don spock does
he would not make false entry
there false entry in the log right now which doesn jibe with the established facts how do you explain that
can but to question spock of all people me yes could run off half-cocked given good reason so could you but not spock it impossible to transporter control
mccoy here emergency
well what is it sickness injury how bad is it
probably somebody discovered hangnail ll beam up and let you know jim
reading for eyes of starfleet command only
oh certifying ordered you to read it know anything at all about this planet
what every ship captain knows general order no vessel under any condition emergency or otherwise is to visit talos four
and to do so is the only death penalty left on our books only fleet command knows why not even this file explains that unlocks the magnetic strip but it does name the only earth ship that ever visited the planet
the enterprise commanded by captain christopher pike
with half vulcan science officer named spock
commodore captain pike he gone
mendez here what is it refuses to acknowledge our signal
out of orbit mister spock seems strange with no navigator on duty
the enterprise knows where she going mister hansen
someone trying to hail us sir
maintain radio silence lieutenant this is first officer spock per starfleet orders this date have been placed in temporary command of the enterprise while our destination is secret our mission is relatively simple starbase command has assigned captain kirk medical rest leave until our return his instructions are that you will obey my orders as you would his first officer out
what going on around here who said jim needed medical rest leave and this call about me being needed aboard the ship ve checked everywhere
and no one from the ship made such call
that right
doctor regret they elected to keep certain things from you will you come with me please
what is this spock captain are you all right flash flash see that you re still signaling
doctor one moment please so there will be no misunderstanding sorry to have to make it an order you re not to disturb captain pike with any questions simply take good care of him follow spock instructions to the letter kirk out flash flash
sir scanners report an object following us about the size of starbase shuttlecraft shall we reverse helm
take no action mister hansen
but at our speed they ll never catch us in case they want to reach us
you have your orders mister hansen we ll make no contact
starbase shuttlecraft one to enterprise come in please enterprise commodore mendez and captain kirk if you read me you are ordered to reply repeating it on all emergency frequencies jim
spock is headed for talos four all right
pulling ahead of us fast fuel is down to sixty three point three if we turn back now we ve just got barely enough to get us back to the base
shuttlecraft to enterprise come in shuttlecraft to enterprise come in enterprise come in
library computer
lock on to sensors measure object now following the enterprise
computed object is class shuttlecraft duranium metal shell ion engine power
stop how long before shuttlecraft fuel supply forces return to starbase
computed shuttlecraft is already past point of safe return
we coast
blast you any way you had no right to come along
rhip captain rank hath its privileges
two hours of oxygen left
wonderful
part of me is hoping the enterprise won come back for us we step on that deck spock is finished court-martialed disgraced
he dead if he makes it to talos four why would he want to get pike there the command reports stated talos contained absolutely no practical benefits to mankind
spock would have some logical reason for going there
maybe maybe he just gone mad
keep wondering who might be after us in shuttlecraft and keep coming up with the same answers but can be right can mister spock
computer control lock on to shuttlecraft following us
locked on tractor beam ready
go to tape abel seven baker execute instructions
is it the captain mister spock
sir the engines are reversing she brought herself to dead stop
this is the first officer speaking security send an armed team to the bridge transporter room stand by to beam captain kirk aboard effective until then lieutenant hansen is in operational command
sir
first officer out doctor as senior officer present present myself to you for arrest
you what
the charge is mutiny doctor never received orders to take command
security reporting mister spock
doctor
mister spock is er under arrest is confinement to quarters enough
adequate doctor ll make no trouble
well confine him
yes sir deck mister scott beam us directly aboard
all right captain locked on to you
transferring command to you sir
accepting command where mister spock
in his quarters under arrest
his quarters after what he done lieutenant
reverse power hold this position tell whoever gave those orders to report
sir there nobody up there giving orders mister spock has the computers running the ship
disengage computer control uhura scott leaves muttering in gaelic
computer control come in
computer
disengage from helm
unable to comply command you will override all contrary instructions voice command disengage from helm
unable to comply any such attempt will cross-circuit vessel life-supporting system computer control cannot be disengaged until vessel reaches planet talos four captain log stardate 3012 despite our best efforts to disengage computers the enterprise is still locked on heading for the mysterious planet talos four meanwhile as required by starfleet general orders preliminary hearing on lieutenant commander spock is being convened and in all the years of my service this is the most painful moment ve ever faced
this hearing is convened mister spock you re aware of your right to counsel of your choice
sir waive counsel further waive rights to this hearing and request immediate court-martial
request denied
may inquire on what grounds captain
mutiny requires trial board of no less than three command officers since there are only two of that rank available
sir must point out that there are three officers of command rank available yourself commodore mendez and captain christopher pike
denied captain pike is complete invalid
believe you ll find he still on the active duty list
we didn have the heart to retire him jim he got you whatever he up to he planned it well captain log stardate 3012 general court-martial convened mister spock has again waived counsel and has entered plea of guilty
mister spock are you aware in pleading guilty that further charge involving the death penalty must be held against you should this vessel enter the talos star group
am
why what does it accomplish to go there or to take captain pike there want to know why
are your comments part of the record sir
yes it on the record
thank you request monitor screen be engaged
for what purpose
to comply with the request you just made sir that explain the importance of going to talos four
by asking why you ve opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present apparently what he had in mind
present your evidence screen on
this is thirteen years ago the enterprise and its commander captain christopher pike way
screen off chris was that really you on the screen flash that impossible mister spock no vessel makes record tapes in that detail that perfect what were we watching
cannot tell you at this time sir
captain pike were any record tapes of this nature made during your voyage flash flash the court is not obliged to view evidence without knowing its source
unless the court asks prisoner why commodore you did ask that question
you mean was maneuvered into asking your evidence is out of order
am forced to contest that commodore want to see more
you have that right captain but just because the prisoner is your first officer and your personal friend
that has nothing to do with it
very well continue
screen on mister scott something out there
as stated gentlemen this was thirteen years ago we were on routine patrol when the ship sensors detected something ahead at first we were not certain what it was
the meteorite beam has not deflected it captain
evasive manoeuvres sir
steady as we go
it radio wave sir we re passing through an old-style distress signal
they were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way
ship in trouble making forced landing sir that it no other message
have fix it comes from the talos star group
we ve no ships or earth colonies that far out
their call letters check with survey expedition columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago
it would take that long for radio beam to travel from there to here
records show the talos group has never been explored solar system similar to earth eleven planets number four seems to be class oxygen atmosphere
then they could still be alive even after eighteen years
if they survived the crash
we aren going to go to be certain
not without any indication of survivors no continue to the vega colony and take care of our own sick and injured first you have the helm maintain present course
yes sir
drop by my cabin doctor boyce enters with bag what that didn say there anything wrong with me
understand we picked up distress signal
that right unless we get anything more positive on it it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent like to log the ship doctor opinion too
oh concur with yours definitely
good glad you do because we re going to stop first at the vega colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also what the devil are you putting in there ice
who wants warm martini
what makes you think need one
sometimes man will tell his bartender things he ll never tell his doctor what been on your mind chris the fight on rigel seven
shouldn it be my only yeoman and two others dead seven injured
was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it
oh should have smelled trouble when saw the swords and the armour instead of that let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors
chris you set standards for yourself no one could meet you treat everyone on board like human being except yourself and now you re tired and you
you bet tired you bet tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn and who going on the landing party and who doesn and who lives and who dies boy ve had it phil
to the point of finally taking my advice rest leave
to the point of considering resigning
and do what
well for one thing go home nice little town with fifty miles of park land around it remember told you had two horses and we used to take some food and ride out all day
ah that sounds exciting ride out with picnic lunch every day
said that one place might go might go into business on regulus or on the orion colony
you an orion trader dealing in green animal women slaves
the point is this isn the only life available there whole galaxy of things to choose from
not for you man either lives life as it happens to him meets it head-on and licks it or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away
now you re beginning to talk like doctor bartender
take your choice we both get the same two kinds of customers the living and the dying message sir there are crash survivors on talos
reads eleven survivors from crash gravity and oxygen within limits food and water obtainable but unless the message faded at that point sir
address intercraft
system open
this is the captain our destination is the talos star group
screen off mister spock truly amazed at your technical prowess in somehow manufacturing all this congratulate you on your imagination but this is court of space law not theatre
captain please tell the court this is not imagination nor some clever photographic record are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago flash yes gentlemen on that screen as it happened the incredible experience of captain christopher pike on talos four if after witnessing this the court wishes to turn this vessel back will release this ship to manual control
you re in no position to bargain this is ridiculous this man mutinied stole your ship abducted captain pike well for me this has gone far enough
we still haven heard the full story vote to continue
and vote we do not deadlock and since
not deadlock there still one member of the trial board to be heard from
very well captain pike it up to you do we continue under these conditions flash
yes captain log supplemental mister spock on trial for mutiny has forced the court to accept unusual evidence on our monitor screen the voyage of captain pike and the enterprise to the one forbidden world in all the galaxy
screen on
we ve settled into orbit sir
geological lab report complete captain
preliminary lab survey ready sir
spectography
our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere sir heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits
gravity
zero point nine of earth
captain reflections sir from the planet surface as read it they polarise out as rounded metal bits could be parts of spaceship hull
prep landing party of six you feel up to it
yes sir
yes sir
sorry number one with little information on this planet we ll have to leave the ship most experienced officer here covering us
of course sir
there no indication of problems down there but let not take chances
yes sir there canyon to the left we can set you there completely unobserved
right the group explores until they find rough settlement
sir
they re men they re humans
captain christopher pike united space ship enterprise
doctor theodore haskins american continent lnstitute
is earth all right
the same old earth and you ll see it very soon
and you won believe how fast you can get back well the time barrier been broken our new ships can
this is vina her parents are dead she was born almost as we crashed the reunion is being watched on another screen by people with big bald heads
as the survivors pack up the settlement enterprise
we ll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly send out scouting and scientific parties now
yes affirmative on the
you appear to be healthy and intelligent captain prime specimen
er affirmative on request landing party out
you must forgive her choice of words captain she lived her whole life with collection of aging scientists
if they can er spare you moment like to make my medical report
think it time to show the captain our secret
their health is excellent almost too good
there reason for our condition but we ve had some doubt if earth is ready to learn the secret let the girl show you we ll accept your judgment pike follows vina up slope to ledge by rock face
you re tired but don worry you ll feel much better soon don you see it here and here
don understand
you will you re perfect choice she vanishes and so do all the survivors and their encampment door opens in the rock face pike is knocked out and taken inside at the settlement
captain everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock they fire their phasers at it to no avail is all some sort of trap we ve lost the captain do you read
what is it
plead signal for you sir go ahead uhura receiving transmissions from planet talos four in violation of starfleet general orders
receiving transmissions from talos four then the images we ve been seeing are
are coming from talos four sir command of the enterprise disable vessel if necessary to prevent further contact message signed comsol starfleet command
mister spock you re aware of the orders regarding any contact with talos four you have deliberately invited the death penalty you ve not only finished yourself spock but you ve finished your captain as well
the commodore must be aware that captain kirk knew nothing of this
and you re aware captain is responsible for everything that occurs on his ship order you to return this vessel back to manual control
sir respectfully decline
very well you ve earned the consequences this court is in recess mendez and yeoman leave scott and mccoy wheel pike out after him
do you know what you re doing have you lost your mind
captain jim please don stop me don let him stop me it your career and captain pike life you must see the rest of the transmission
lock him up to be concluded next week enterprise is at red alert as she orbits muddy looking planet every so often the ship shakes
stay on top of it mister sulu
we re holding orbit sir the helm is sluggish
control circuits threatening to overload captain
understood engineer mister spock we can avoid these areas of turbulence
believe we ll have them plotted in few more orbits captain sulu console explodes and he is thrown to the floor unconscious
sickbay to the bridge
switching to manual captain do we maintain this orbit
spock
this is of great scientific importance captain we re actually passing through ripples in time
maintain orbit open the channel to starfleet command precautionary measure lieutenant broadcast to starfleet command my past week log entries starting with the unusual readings we had on the instruments and how they led us here inform starfleet command that apparently something or someone down on this planet mccoy enters
pointing to sulu bones can effect changes in time causing turbulent waves of space displacement
some heart flutter better risk few drops of cordrazine
tricky stuff are you sure you want to risk the hypo is administered and sulu opens his eyes
you were about to make medical comment jim
who me doctor
at the helm we re guiding around most of the time ripples now
mister spock
all plotted but one captain coming up on it now seems to be fairly heavy displacement and they hit it just as mccoy still has the hypo in his hand and the jolt results in him injecting it into his own stomach
bones get back to your positions
the hypo captain
it was set for cordrazine
empty
communications emergency medical team
screams killers assassins won let you ll kill you first won let you you won get me murderers killers he dashes into the turbolift
security alert captain log supplemental entry two drops of cordrazine can save man life hundred times that amount has just accidentally been pumped into doctor mccoy body in strange wild frenzy he has fled the ship bridge all connecting decks have been placed on alert we have no way of knowing if the madness is permanent or temporary or in what direction it will drive mccoy mccoy enters knocks out the chief very quickly and scientifically then beams himself away
continue alert decks four through eleven the medical department knows as little as we do in dosages approaching this there some record of wild paranoia
confirmed by the library record tapes captain subjects failed to recognise acquaintances became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger and were seeking escape at any cost extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might
bridge here go ahead
security 054 sir we just found the transport chief injured himself down to the planet
and the transporter at that time captain was focused on the centre of the time disturbance
so whatever down there mccoy is in the heart of it set up landing party let go get him kirk out the landing party is kirk spock scott uhura and two security guards among remains of fluted columns and fragments of greek-style buildings is an irregular dough-nut shaped object with lights in it
these ruins extend to the horizon begin recording
recording sir
and of considerable age on the order of ten thousand centuries old
detail fan out what is this thing mister spock it seems to be pulsating with power of some kind analysis please
unbelievable captain
that funny
this single object is the source of all the time displacement
explain
can for this to do what it does is impossible by any science understand it is operating even now putting out waves and waves of time displacement which we picked up millions of miles away
landing party to enterprise no sign of doctor mccoy search progressing and he pops up from behind rock after she and her security guard have passed by
incredible power it can be machine as we understand mechanics
then what is it
the doughnut pulses bright in time with the words question since before your sun burned hot in space and before your race was born have awaited question
what are you
am the guardian of forever
are you machine or being
am both and neither am my own beginning my own ending
see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles
answer as simply as your level of understanding makes possible
time portal captain gateway to other times and dimensions if correct
as correct as possible for you your science knowledge is obviously primitive
really
annoyed spock
behold gateway to your own past if you wish camel train passing pyramid ancient rome images appear inside the doughnut
killers killers won let you get me ll kill you first won let you get me assassins murderers killers scott and guard manage to grab mccoy and spock neck-pinches him an army of lancers charge across the doughnut
spock if that is doorway back through time could we somehow take bones back day in time then
relive the accident this time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided look at the speed with which the centuries are passing captain to step through on precisely the day we wish
guardian can you change the speed at which yesterday passes
was made to offer the past in this manner cannot change the us cavalry charges
strangely compelling isn it to step through there and lose oneself in another world
am fool my tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed ve missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever but mccoy has woken up and dashes towards the guardian
doctor mccoy
bones no mccoy leaps through the doughnut and the pictures stop he gone
where is he
he has passed into what was
captain ve lost contact with the ship was talking to them suddenly it went dead no static just nothing
kirk to enterprise scotty
nothing wrong with the communicator sir
your vessel your beginning all that you knew is gone
mccoy has somehow changed history
you mean we re stranded down here
with no past no future
captain frightened
earth not there at least not the earth we know we re totally alone captain log no stardate for us time does not exist mccoy back somewhere in the past has effected change in the course of time all earth history has been changed there is no starship enterprise we have only one chance we have asked the guardian to show us earth history again spock and will go back into time ourselves and attempt to set right what ever it was that mccoy changed
was recording images at the time mccoy left rather barbaric period in your american history believe can approximate just when to jump perhaps within month of the correct time week if we re fortunate
make sure we arrive before mccoy got there it vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history guardian if we are successful
then you will be returned it will be as though none of you had gone
captain it seems impossible even if you were able to find the right date
then even finding mccoy would be miracle
there is no alternative
scotty when you think you ve waited long enough each of you will have to try it even if you fail at least you ll be alive in some past world somewhere
aye
seconds now sir stand by
good luck gentlemen
happiness at least sir first world war images
and now they leap through wall with poster for boxing at madison square gardens welcome to the depression
ve seen old photographs of this period an economic upheaval had occurred
it was called depression circa 1930 quite barbaric two women give then curious looks and spock hides his ears with his hands
we seem to be costumed little out of step with the time
afraid going to be difficult to explain in any case captain
well mister spock if we can disguise you we ll find some way of explaining you
that should prove interesting
let get out of here they are nearly run down crossing the street
fascinating
look out will you why don you watch where you re going they head into an alley with washing hanging out on the fire escape
theft captain
well we ll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later think going to like this century simple easier to manage we re not going to have any difficulty explaining then he sees the policeman
well
you re police officer recognise the traditional accoutrements
you were saying you ll have no trouble explaining it
my friend is obviously chinese see you ve noticed the ears they re actually easy to explain crowd is gathering
perhaps the unfortunate accident had as child
the unfortunate accident he had as child he caught his head in mechanical rice picker but fortunately there was an american missionary living close by who was actually skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life
all right all right drop those bundles and put your hands on that wall there come on
oh how careless of your wife to let you go out that way
what where
oh yes it quite untidy here let me help you and quick neck pinch in front of witnesses then they grab the clothes and run off with whistles blowing they duck down the alley beside the 21st street mission and down the stairs to the cellar
you were actually enjoying my predicament back there at times you seem quite human
captain hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer
sorry they get changed into jeans and shirts
time we faced the unpleasant facts
first believe we have about week before mccoy arrives but we can be certain
arrives where honolulu boise san diego why not outer mongolia for that matter
there is theory there could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid like river with currents eddies backwash
and the same currents that swept mccoy to certain time and place might sweep us there too
unless that is true captain we have no hope frustrating locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival even the images of what he did if only could tie this tricorder in with the ship computers for just few moments
couldn you build some form of computer aid here
in this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture
yes well it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic mister spock excuse me sometimes expect too much of you the lights come on
who there spock puts on woolen hat that was conveniently amongst the clothes kirk stole young woman wearing an apron comes down the stairs
excuse us miss we didn mean to trespass it cold outside
lie is poor way to say hello it isn that cold
no we were being chased by policeman
why
these clothes we stole them we didn have any money
well could do with some help around here doing dishes sweeping general cleaning
at what rate of payment need radio tubes and so forth my hobby
fifteen cents an hour for ten hours day what are your names
mine is jim kirk his is spock
edith keeler you can start by cleaning up down here
excuse me miss where are we
you re in the 21st street mission
do you run this place
indeed do mister kirk she leaves them
radio tubes and so on approve of hobbies mister spock kirk and spock collect their bowls of soup and pieces of bread and sit at one of the long tables
good evening she steps up onto small stage with piano
you ll be sorry
why
you expect to eat for free or something you got to listen to goody two-shoes
now as sure somebody out there has said it time to pay for the soup
not that she bad-looking broad but if she really wanted to help out fella in need
shut up shut up want to hear what she has to say
yes of course captain
now let start by getting one thing straight not do-gooder if you re bum if you can break off of the booze or whatever it is that makes you bad risk then get out now don pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love when every day is just struggle to survive but do insist that you do survive because the days and the years ahead are worth living for one day soon man is going to be able to harness incredible energies maybe even the atom energies that could ultimately hurl us to other worlds in some sort of spaceship and the men that reach out into space will be able to find ways to feed the hungry millions of the world and to cure their diseases they will be able to find way to give each man hope and common future and those are the days worth living for our deserts will bloom she continues under the dialogue
development of atomic power is years away and space flight years after that
speculation gifted insight
find her most uncommon mister spock
prepare for tomorrow get ready don give up later when the bowls are being handed in edith calls after kirk
mister kirk you are uncommon workmen that basement looks like it been scrubbed and polished
then we can report back for other work
yes seven clock in the morning do you have flop for the night
what
you really are new at this aren you flop is place to sleep
oh
there vacant room at the place where live for two dollars week if you want to ll take you there
thank you
good she goes to get her coat
we have flop
we have what captain
place to sleep
one might have said so in the first place it must be some days later because spock has already built 50 horror movie contraption complete with static electricity running between two vertical wires kirk enters with groceries and turns the whining thing off
captain must have some platinum small block would be sufficient five or six pounds by passing certain circuits through there to be used as duodynetic field core
mister spock ve brought you some assorted vegetables baloney in hard roll for myself and ve spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you mister spock this bag does not contain platinum silver or gold nor is it likely to in the near future
captain you re asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins
mccoy ll be along in few days perhaps sooner there no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together this has to work
captain captain in three weeks at this rate possibly month might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits there knock at the door
your hat
if you can leave immediately can get you five hours work at twenty two cents an hour what what on earth is that
am endeavouring ma am to construct mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins kirk and spock are sweeping the floor with the chairs stacked on the tables and two men repairing clocks
captain tools for finely detailed work later combination padlock is being opened by someone with very sensitive ears spock is stoking the boiler when edith comes in to confront them
that toolbox was locked with combination lock and you opened it like real pro why did you do it
needed the fine tools for my radio work they have been returned in the morning
sorry can
if mister spock says that he needs the tools and that they ll be returned tomorrow morning you can bet your reputation on that miss keeler
on one condition walk me home still have few questions like to ask about you two oh and don give me that questions about little old us look you know as well as do how out of place you two are around here
interesting where would you estimate we belong miss keeler
you at his side as if you ve always been there and always will and you you belong in another place don know where or how ll figure it out eventually
ll finish with the furnace
captain even when he doesn say it he does they are strolling along hand in hand as goodnight sweetheart carries in the air from radio repair shop
why does spock call you captain were you in the war together
we served together
and you don want to talk about it why did you do something wrong are you afraid of something whatever it is let me help
let me help hundred years or so from now believe famous novelist will write classic using that theme he ll recommend those three words even over love you
centuries from now who is he where does he come from er where will he come from
silly question want to hear silly answer
yes
planet circling that far left star in orion belt see not that you can actually see any stars in the night sky above the brooklyn bridge using the clock-mender tools spock gets an image on his tricorder screen of newspaper report edith keeler social worker from 21st street mission was killed today it says kirk enters
how are the stone knives and bearskins
may have found our focal point in time
think you may also find you have connection burning someplace
yes overloading those lines believe we ll have our answer on this screen captain
good
and captain you may find this bit distressing
let see what you have
ve slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex
february 23rd 1936 six years from now reading below the headline fdr confers with slum area angel the president and edith keeler conferred for some time today then the whole thing goes up in flames
how bad
bad enough
the president and edith keeler
it would seem unlikely jim few moments ago read 1930 newspaper article
we know her future within six years from now she ll become very important nationally famous
or captain edith keeler will die this year saw her obituary some sort of traffic accident
you must be mistaken they both can be true
captain edith keeler is the focal point in time we ve been looking for the point that both we and doctor mccoy have been drawn to
she has two possible futures then and depending on whether she lives or dies all of history will be changed and mccoy
is the random element
in his condition what does he do does he kill her
or perhaps he prevents her from being killed we don know which
get this thing fixed we must find out before mccoy arrives
captain suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again edith keeler must die the man from the canteen steals milk bottle from doorstep when mccoy leaps in through singers book store window and starts shouting
assassins murderers murderers assassins you what planet is this he drops the bottle no don run won kill you it they who do the killing don run won kill you jim and edith are climbing the stairs together
why what is so funny about man reaching for the moon
how do you know
just know that all feel it and more think that one day they ll take all the money they spend now on war and death
and make them spend it on life
yes you see the same things that do we speak the same language
the very same they are outside room 33 when he leans in for the kiss mccoy catches the down-and-out
no
glad you got away too why do you think they want to kill us
look fella you take sip too much of that old wood alky and and almost anything seems like it
where where are we earth the constellations seem right but explain explain this trick

biped small good cranial development no doubt considerable human ancestry is that how you re able to fake all of this very good modern museum perfection right down to the cement beams very very good oh give lot to see the hospital probably needles and sutures all the pain they used to hand-cut and sew people like garments needles and sutures oh the terrible pain he passes out on the ground and his colour starts to improve the man frisks him finds his phaser and runs off little way then he fiddles with the phaser and disintegrates himself
how long before we get full answer
ll need at least two more days before dare make another attempt
mccoy could have been in the city week now for all we know and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning
captain our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits
must know whether she lives or dies spock must know what to do it morning apparently bums are still sleeping in shop doorways all about it mccoy spots men going into the mission and follows them edith is pouring cups of brown liquid
oh miss that coffee it just smells wonderful
you look terrible you better sit down come on
can got to keep moving can let them find me
there cot in the back room they won find you there come on she helps him out just as spock comes in and starts serving the drinks
this is how history went after mccoy changed it here in the late 1930s growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the united states entry into the second world war while peace negotiations dragged on germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments
germany fascism hitler they won the second world war
because all this lets them develop the a-bomb first there no mistake captain let me run it again edith keeler founder of the peace movement
but she was right peace was the way
she was right but at the wrong time with the a-bomb and with their v2 rockets to carry them germany captured the world
no
and all this because mccoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in street accident as she was meant to we must stop him jim
how did she die what day
we can estimate general happenings from these images but can trace down precise actions at exact moments captain sorry
spock believe in love with edith keeler
jim edith keeler must die mccoy stirs dislodging the moist towel from his forehead
hey now come on you re not ready to take on any tigers just yet lie down
the most common question to ask would be where am don think ll ask it
why not
the only possible answer would conclusively prove that either unconscious or demented this looks like old earth around 1920 or 25
would you care to try for 30
am unconscious or demented
have friend that talks about earth the same way that you do would you like to meet him
surgeon not psychiatrist am leonard mccoy senior medical officer aboard the uss enterprise
don mean to disbelieve you but that hardly navy uniform
it quite all right it quite all right dear because don believe in you either
get some rest edith has just gone up flight of stairs
edith
are you following me sir
with ulterior motives does that please you
hope it means she stumbles on the step and kirk catches her while spock watches oh how stupid ve been up and down those stairs thousand times could have broken my neck spock goes back into room 21 as she kisses jim and re-emerges when kirk comes down the stairs again
captain did not plan to eavesdrop
no of course you didn
must point out that when she stumbled she might have died right there had you not caught her
it not yet time mccoy isn here
we re not that sure of our facts who to say when the exact time will come save her do as your heart tells you to do and millions will die who did not die before mccoy is out of bed
come in
well you look just fine doctor
thank you
thought you might like to see the evening paper
no not particularly you know ve convinced myself that this is all in cordrazine hallucination but ve decided you re not
that reassuring
but if you re not what are you
friend when you showed up here you looked like you could use one
don doubt it what about this place do you run it
try to
why
it necessary
well it was for me at least you may have saved my life
lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes
not as wrong as the bottle drank from allow me to show my gratitude perhaps there something can do around here to thank you
we can talk about that later have to go my young man is taking me to clark gable movie
who movie
clark gable don you know
well know what movie is but
that very strange you get some rest ll see you later edith kirk and spock leave the mission together then spock heads off alone kirk and edith dodge traffic to cross the street
if we hurry maybe we can catch the clark gable movie at the orpheum
what
you know doctor mccoy said the same thing
mccoy leonard mccoy
yes he in the mission he
stay right here spock stay right there
what is it
mccoy he in mccoy comes out and they greet each other enthusiastically truck is coming down the street as edith starts to cross not looking
no jim
edith mccoy dashes forward but kirk grabs him and pulls him back onto the pavement just as edith and the truck meet in in squeal of brakes
you deliberately stopped me jim could have saved her do you know what you just did
he knows doctor he knows kirk and spock leap back out of the guardian
what happened sir you only left moment ago mccoy returns
we were successful
time has resumed its shape all is as it was before many such journeys are possible let me be your gateway
captain the enterprise is up there they re asking if we want to beam up
let get the hell out of here
ready to beam down energise energise
having trouble gentlemen
just don understand the problem sir
you re beaming cargo down to penal colony mister berkeley
their security force field sir
enterprise to tantalus colony
request opening in your force field for beaming down of cargo
energise any incoming cargo
just one item sir some research material bound for the central bureau of penology at stockholm
oh mister berkeley you might refamiliarise yourself with the manual on penal colony procedures
immediately sir
think you can take the time to lock this up first
ll get vault assignment leaves the box opens man climbs out and attacks the technician captain log stardate 2715 exchanged cargo with penal colony on tantalus ve departed without going ashore
would like to have met doctor adams have you ever been to penal colony since they started following his theories
cage is cage jim
you re behind the times bones they re more like resort colonies now
message captain switching to speaker of our inmates this is potentially violent case possibly hidden in the box we beamed up to you repeat unable to locate one of our inmates this is potentially violent case
enterprise acknowledging stand by security alert three
security alert condition three all sections go to alert condition three we may have an intruder aboard three intruder aboard
to intruder who has swapped overall with technician hey you from engineering runs bridge section deck fourteen
captain section deck fourteen reporting trouble someone in engineering uniform
security control this is the bridge come in
have them captain closing off deck fourteen search in progress intruder jumps one of the security men approximately six foot four male early forties approach with caution this man extremely dangerous
repeat approach with extreme caution bridge out
negative in the deck area captain he may have gotten out expanding search to adjoining sections
enterprise to tantalus colony
doctor adams this is captain kirk it appears we may have an inmate of yours aboard the ship
transporter crewman found unconscious captain cargo case open and empty
make that definite doctor he aboard repeat he clever as well as extremely violent take all possible precautions
we ll keep you posted doctor kirk out
interesting your earth people glorify organised violence for forty centuries but you imprison those who employ it privately
and of course your people found an answer
we disposed of emotion doctor where there is no emotion there is no motive for violence
where the captain which one of you is the captain
captain kirk
my name is van gelder want asylum
at gunpoint
want your promise first your word that you won take me back there to tantalus
no promises give me the weapon
no no no not going back ll disable your vessel first you choose captain ll destroy your control panel gelder is distracted and spock neck-pinches him
take him to sickbay reverse course head back for tantalus colony
abnormal of course but it not schizophrenia tissue damage or any condition acquainted with jim and you know after getting him here it took almost triple dose of sedative to put him under
your report said he was quite talkative
but not very informative he claimed one thing then he seemed to forget and then he start to claim something else but always with just the ring of truth in it sure like to study this one jim
not our problem bones
you smart button-pushing brass hat wash your hands of it is that your system you re both quite sure of yourselves aren you quite expert take him back let someone else worry about him
what did you say your name was
my name my name is simon van gelder in great pain was the director of director at the tantalus colony
you see what mean
was graduate of of was assistant to doctor knew knew but they ve erased it
erased
edited adjusted subverted me but won forget won forget you you re so blind ignorant you believe belong back there don you dead or alive well won let you take me back not going ll die first do you hear not going no no no
estimated arrival at tantalus
fifty seven minutes thirty seconds captain
what so fascinating
an identification tape from our ship library on doctor simon van gelder
doctor van gelder
doctor van gelder captain no mistake there full id tape on him
committed to tantalus colony when
assigned there six months ago as doctor adams associate
ship to surface tantalus colony
hailing frequency open sir
enterprise to tantalus colony
this is captain kirk like to speak to doctor adams
doctor adams regarding your escaped man injuries
no casualties sir this man is doctor simon van gelder very concerned in the violent state he in
no harm to him sir we thought you might enlighten us as to his condition experimental beam we hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles van gelder felt he hadn the moral right to expose another man to something he hadn tried on his own person
tragedy doctor
jim that doesn quite ring true
er doctor adams please stand by explain
don believe him can explain it but the more study that patient
you don believe him and you can explain it bones are you aware that in the last twenty years doctor adams has done more to revolutionise to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries ve been to those penal colonies since they ve begun following his methods and they re not cages anymore
jim
they re clean decent hospitals for sick minds
jim listen
gentlemen suggest you ask doctor adams if he wants van gelder returned
doctor adams regarding van gelder are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours like van gelder to have the best possible treatment of course
thank you doctor ll take it up with the ship surgeon stand by well bones you ve got the ball you care to recommend better place
there are no superior facilities he knows that but that not the question if something unusual is going on down there
an assumption doctor
required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log that requires you to answer in your log sorry jim
doctor adams this is rather embarrassing by strict interpretation of our starship regulation required to initiate an investigation of this so that proper report personal favour if you beam down and look into it yourself sure you realise we don get too many visitors here oh er captain would appreciate it if you could come down with minimum staff we re forced to limit outside contact as much as possible
affirmative doctor ve visited rehab colonies before enterprise out find me someone in your department with psychiatric and penology experience if possible
yes sir captain log stardate 2715 standard orbit planet tantalus
mission routine investigation and report as per ship surgeon medical log as for my last entry it seems will get to meet doctor adams at last however would have preferred other circumstances sickbay report doctor
and you prefer to keep him here until complete my investigation anyway
believe we should jim of our psychiatrists does have background in rehabilitative therapy doctor noel standing by in the transporter room now
thank you doctor bridge out mister spock
co-ordinates
locked in sir ready to beam down
doctor helen noel captain we ve met don you remember the science lab christmas party
yes remember
you dropped in
yes yes remember
problem captain
mister spock you tell mccoy that she had better check out as the best assistant ever had energise
energise
in here presume doctor
perhaps it would be simpler if you called me helen captain since
this is another time another place and another situation
of course captain
elevator and going down quite ways
in his arms wouldn recommend it for weak hearts
hello captain kirk and er
doctor helen noel it pleasure to finally meet you sir
thank you thank you captain welcome to devil island doctor
perhaps you ll call me helen doctor with so many titles around we re not going to be sure who talking to who
shall indeed won you
thank you
believe regulations call for me to check my weapon
no no that won be necessary in your case captain just keep it out of sight hmm know you people feel as naked without weapon as we do without medikit small toast do you mind it such great day for us here on tantalus when we have visitors no matter what the excuse
doctor
oh now captain you made your apology from upstairs now forget it don think you ll be able to get through the security screen captain just second hmm there now try it
kirk to enterprise come in
your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose mister spock we arrived safely and we re here with doctor adams right now kirk out
ah lethe come in lethe this is captain kirk and doctor helen noel lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as therapist and very good one too might add
love my work
go right ahead captain
before you came here
was another person malignant hateful
may ask what crime you committed
does it matter that person no longer exists
um part of our cure if you will captain is to bury the past why should person go on living with unbearable memories if there no necess oh feel quite sure that you concur with me in that doctor helen
shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy
yes and now to the toast hmm you ll forgive us lethe there you are captain to all mankind may we never find space so vast planets so cold heart and mind so empty that that we cannot fill them with love and warmth
quite tour doctor very impressive
thank you hi carl
doctor
yes
hmm
ah was afraid you would ask about this captain one doesn like to talk about their personal failures you know it was just an experiment that went wrong afraid
may see it
captain if something hasn worked out and therefore has no scientific fact
shall we leave it up to the doctor
since you brought me down here for advice captain
one of the advantages of being captain doctor is being able to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it
think ll have to award that round to the captain helen you re fighting over your weight all right let take look
not criminal do not require neural neutraliser
neural neutraliser can you explain that doctor van gelder
room device door control panel see it device light the light
this room what happens there
screams
neural neutraliser experimental actually we don expect to get much use out of it at all that beam from above neutralises brain waves relaxes the patient mind does them no harm of course and the effects are only temporary
one question doctor if it doesn do any good
why do we go on using it hmm captain hope yes yes there always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases
tranquillisers are fine captain but to continually pump chemicals into person bloodstream
exactly my point helen yes shall we he and noel leave
to therapist how does it work
quite simple off on switches and the large control here changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam
captain you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of the wise old sage to be taught all the world wisdom while standing on one foot
beam neutralising has been experimented with on earth captain not acquainted with this particular style of equipment but can assure you that doctor adams has not created chamber of horrors here
didn mean to suggest that he had the reason asked sir was you haven mentioned where doctor van gelder injury occurred
right here captain yes simon was very stubborn man he could ve sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or even higher or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in case he got into trouble but but no he tried it alone and on full volume it pity
to therapist thank you leaves
to man in treatment chair you will forget all you have heard to remember any portion of it any word will cause you pain terrible pain growing more terrible as you fight to remember
can you give us your present location captain
then you re with doctor adams now
captain van gelder has made reference to particular treatment room the term was neural neutraliser
yes he was injured there ve seen the room doctor adams explained
go ahead mister spock anything further
your mister spock sounds like very excellent second in command captain kirk please tell him to go ahead and speak freely have to check in with member of my staff anyway
thank you doctor adams
excuse me
stand by mister spock doctor adams has left with some things to attend to what is it mister spock
van gelder is extremely agitated captain and warns that you are in danger
oh that foolish
tell mccoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified according to adams van gelder created his own problem
he suffering from were short-circuited it no wonder he having delusions
mccoy here received and understood captain can you tell us any more
not really
when do you plan to beam back up captain
think we ll spend the night here mister spock
no no no no
and you will continue to check in every four hours
kirk out
no no no don let them you must warn your captain no no don let him stay don let him stay don no no don hypo me please don hypo me ll try not to fight ll try but you must listen warn your captain doctor adams doc doctor adams will destroy
destroy how what
right death acting captain must now use an ancient vulcan technique to probe into van gelder tortured mind
spock if there the slightest possibility it might help
ve never used it on human doctor
if there any way we can look into this man mind to see if what he seeing is real or delusion
it hidden personal thing to the vulcan people part of our private lives
now look spock jim kirk could be in real trouble will it work or not
it could be dangerous do you understand it requires make pressure changes in your nerves your blood vessels
you must open my mind let me warn you and explain to you
this will not affect you doctor mccoy only the person touch it is not hypnosis
understand spock puts his hands on gelder face good the reading levelling
you begin to feel strange euphoria your body floats
yes begin to feel it
open your mind we move together our minds sharing the same thoughts
good evening
good evening
what did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon
you could ve waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that captain
didn
thought they were happy well-adjusted
but bit blank
captain if you re questioning the methods of man like tristan adams
like to see that treatment room again you say you re somewhat familiar with the theory behind it
yes somewhat but if you simply state any doubts you have to doctor adams
and if he lying he ll continue to lie and won find out thing the only way can be sure is to see that machine at work or is that too impractical and unscientific of me doctor well
coming
what is our name who are we
we are simon van gelder
doctor adams the neural neutraliser what did he do to us
he can reshape any mind he chooses he used it to erase our memories put his own thoughts there he was surprised it took so much power we fought him remember but we grew so tired our minds so blank so open that any thought he placed there became our thoughts our minds so empty like sponge needing thoughts begging empty loneliness so lonely to be sitting there empty wanting any word from him love
yes
hate
yes
live
yes
die
yes
such agony to be empty
empty
lonely
lonely
so empty
empty
so empty
have no desire to damage my brain can this be handled with reasonable safety yes or no
yes
and will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest
yes captain know my profession kirk sits in treatment chair ready
mm-hmm
we ll try minimum intensity second or two light turns
anytime you re ready doctor just for second or two
we already tried it for that long captain
nothing happened
something happened your face went completely blank
try harmless suggestion
light turns you re hungry
you know when we finally get through this like to locate and raid kitchen somewhere
put that suggestion in your mind captain said simply that you were hungry
remarkably effective for device that doctor adams was going to abandon
think we should try this again
yes pick something unusual an unusual suggestion something we can both be sure of
light turns at the christmas party we met we danced you talked about the stars suggest now that it happened in different way you swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin
merry christmas
captain if your crew saw you carry me here
my crew is sworn to secrecy
but my reputation mean just having met like this of course it would be different if you cared for me
you want me to manufacture lie wrap it up as christmas present for you
no prefer honesty they kiss
now captain kirk is going to have complete demonstration want there to be no doubts whatsoever in his mind mmm you re madly in love with helen captain you lie cheat steal for her sacrifice your career your reputation
no doctor no
the pain do you feel it captain you must have her or the pain grows worse the pain the longing for her
helen
no
for years you ve loved her captain for years
for years ve loved you
you must continue to remember that captain and now she gone machine to maximum
helen helen don go need you helen
reduces intensity now captain you must take your phaser weapon and drop it on the floor captain the pain increases unless you obey me
must drop it
very good captain very good indeed and now your communicator drop it on the floor
kirk to enterprise argh machine to maximum kirk to enterprise argh
no
they ve taken you from the room captain you re in your own quarters now
helen helen for years ve loved you helen
try to remember
ve loved you
he placed all that in your mind
for years
remember doctor adams took the controls away from me do you remember the pain and then his voice remember
yes yes remember remember helen look the duct the duct give me hand here pull cover comes open air conditioning it has to connect with other ducts and tunnels you can get through this it might lead to the power supply short-circuited it would cut off the security force field have you had any training in hyper-power circuits
no
megavoltage touch the wrong line and you re dead
anything better than adams treatment room he closes the cover behind her and the door opens time for another treatment
please don fight me captain the pain only gets worse when you doubt me you believe in me completely
believe in you
you trust me completely
trust you
excellent captain compliment you do you know doctor van gelder was down on his hands and knees sobbing at this point it was so gratifying so fortunate to have had couple of excellent specimens to to work with ve learned great deal
the woman doctor she gone doctor adams
notify security at once lethe where is she captain
argh don know
where is helen and with what instructions
don know collapses noel makes it to the power control room and finds an off switch but it won move
emergency channel
it no good mister spock can break through their force field
keep trying noel hides as guards search for her and when they go she pulls down the master high voltage switch guard grabs her
put him back in the chair eli and find that girl kirk knocks them both out and leaves the guard turns the power back on again but when he reaches for noel she pushes him against the high volt grid and he fries cutting the power again
mister spock the force field is gone can send you right to the source of the interruption
to mccoy get some security people and follow me down energise noel dashes back into the aircon tunnels
pushes load of buttons enterprise this is spock force field has been eliminated turns main power back on again
captain captain
helps her out of vent helen are you all right kisses her
yes this isn right captain spock enters doctor adams did this to you
doctor adams doctor the treatment room follow me
jim kirk turns machine off
the power came on
he dead captain
the machine wasn on high enough to kill
but he was alone can you imagine the mind emptied by that thing without even tormentor for company
understand
oh captain there was message from tantalus colony sir
it was from van gelder he thought you like to know the treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed
thank you
it hard to believe that man could die of loneliness
not when you ve sat in that room take us out of orbit mister spock ahead warp factor one
acknowledged captain warp factor one
anything lieutenant
no sir ve tried every major transmitting station on deneva none of them have acknowledged my contact signal
try gsk-783 sub-space frequency
but sir that call sign for private transmitter
very well aware of that lieutenant try it
yes sir
evaluation mister spock
as speculated captain the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy over here the beta portilin system the ancient civilisations archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning two hundred years ago levinius five was swept by mass insanity then theta cygni twelve the last was ingraham two years ago
and next in line deneva bones what your theory about the cause of all this
there no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets jim
but it follows definite pattern systematic progression from planet to planet
captain we re picking up ship on our sensors heading directly into the denevan sun he ll burn up
plot an interception course mister sulu warp factor eight lieutenant uhura try to contact that ship
aye aye sir
the ship is one-man vessel of denevan configuration captain he does not seem to be out of control his course is straight for the sun
scotty tractor beams
out of range sir
making contact captain
denevan ship this is the uss enterprise can you reverse your course acknowledge
captain we ll get too close to the sun
keep closing denevan ship reverse your course do you hear me reverse your course acknowledge
outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising
he too close captain
so are we hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising the sun gravimetric pull increasing
he burned up captain
reverse course one hundred and eighty degrees about
aye sir
all clear captain hull temperature falling gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level
very well reduce to sub-warp speed take us to deneva
aye aye sir
that denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun why
there one possibility the mass insanity may have reached this planet too
captain having difficulty on that transmitter call to deneva
keep trying
yes sir
jim your brother sam and his family aren they stationed on this planet captain log stardate 3287 the mass insanity we have tracked across this section of the galaxy seems to have already touched deneva that planet colonised over century ago is one of the most beautiful in the galaxy
planet development is normal captain originally colonised as freighting-line base in this area
aye they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the asteroid belt for the miners and bringing cargo out ve made the run couple of times myself as an engineering advisor
no federation contacts for over year
captain ve made contact with your private transmitter sir
put it on audio know please please help us
aurelan this is jim on the enterprise repeat your message
contact broken sir
re-establish
sorry sir
not interested in your excuses lieutenant re-establish contact with that transmitter
afraid that impossible at the moment captain they stopped broadcasting immediately they do not acknowledge my contact signal
keep trying to raise them
yes sir
jim did you know who that woman was
yes you were right while back my brother sam lives on deneva he research biologist that woman sounded like his wife aurelan
set your phasers on stun we re going to beam directly into the capital city alert status mister spock
lieutenant uhura has had no further response to our signals sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface however they are strangely quiet very little activity
ll want complete transcript of everything that happens down there yeoman
yes sir
let go energise kirk spock mccoy scott the yeoman and two security guards beam into an open area with grass formal ponds and sculpture in front of concrete and glass-fronted building
there are almost million inhabitants of deneva there more than one hundred thousand in this city alone where is everyone
they re here captain in the buildings strangely quiescent
my brother lab is over there they signalled us once there should be someone there let find out what happening
captain several people approaching
go back get away we don want to hurt you go back get out of here go on get away go away get out of here we don want to hurt you
stand by to fire fire the four attacking men are stunned
did you hear what they said mister spock
indeed they seemed most concerned for our safety
they tried to brain us with these clubs check them out bones
their attitude was inconsistent with their actions
to say the least
there something wrong jim their nervous systems unconscious like this there should be just routine autonomic activity but getting very high reading as though even in their unconscious state they re being violently stimulated woman scream cuts the air
fan out follow me security woman is trying to cover the air vents man and boy are lying on the floor
they re here they re here please keep them away
bearhugging her aurelan
they re here they re here
bones mccoy sedates her aurelan you re safe now
is this your brother jim
sam it is my brother was my brother
sorry jim the boy unconscious but he still alive
peter
better get the boy and his mother back to the ship can do much for them down here
get ready to beam up
mccoy to enterprise prepare to beam up party of four
captain understand how you must
yes yes mister spock you heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here your guess
notice the ventilator captain apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in obviously they were not entirely successful
it doesn make sense there are no harmful life forms reported our sensors didn pick up anything that didn belong here
that is correct am at loss to understand it
ready to beam up captain like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness
take charge of the landing party mister spock want some answers to all this
won be able to give you the exact cause until get the plates back from the lab they re both in extreme pain sedated them heavily but your sister-in-law seems to have high tolerance the tranquilliser hasn affected her much
can she talk
yes
aurelan aurelan it jim
jim sam he
he dead but your son still alive you ve got to help us
you are here it is you jim
yes here you have to tell us what happened aurelan to you and the others
they came eight months ago
who
things horrible things visitors brought them in their vessel from planet ingraham
what kind of things
not the ship crew fault the things made them bring their ship here
aurelan it important that you tell us what kind of things
not their fault she starts screaming and crying again so mccoy gives her another shot
when she answers questions any questions it as if she fighting to get the answers out as though something is exerting pain to stop her
they use it to control us they re spreading jim they need us to be their arms and legs they re forcing us to build ships for them don let them don let them go any further one last scream and convulsion then all her readings plummet to zero
my brother son
ll do everything can jim to save him
report
the streets are extraordinarily quiet captain we ve seen no other denevans and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out
you ve seen some kind of creature any alien form
none sir just that noise we heard
peculiar buzzing sound we were about to investigate it
all right let go find out what it is set your phasers on force three to kill we re looking for some kind of creature and we already know it will kill they go down some steps into shady courtyard where the noise is coming from there are gelatinous-looking creatures attached to the shady side of lintel
spock one detaches and flies around them
form ring fire after prolonged burst one falls to the ground and the others fly off
incredible not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers it does not even register on my tricorder
captain it doesn even look real
it is not life as we know or understand it yet is obviously alive it exists
and it can bear up under full phaser power
captain suggest we risk taking it aboard
it too close in here it may be trap in here let move out as they head up the stairs the felled creature revives and lands on spock back he falls back in pain
spock spock he pulls it off it gone can you stand spock are you all right captain log supplemental whatever the creatures are they have apparently taken over all the inhabitants of deneva meanwhile ship surgeon doctor mccoy is examining strange puncture wound left by one of the creatures on mister spock back
nurse that the second time he come out of it either he fighting us or something inside of him is fighting us
doctor the readings have never looked like that before not even on mister spock
let prepare to close nurse
doctor that not all you re going to do
miss chapel
doctor there is more of it in him entwined all through his body
miss chapel if you cannot assist me as required call another nurse in here but do one or the other now mccoy enters in his surgical scrubs carrying jar
how is he
to be very frank jim don know that can do anything for spock or your nephew hold up the jar they re pieces of some form of living tissue removed one from spock spinal cord the other from your sister-in-law body they re both the same the boy too weak to touch besides removal of the tissue wouldn stop the pain anyhow as far as can tell
did you operate on spock in time
no just removed these for examination his body full of these tentacles entwining and growing all about his nervous system
my nephew
the same evidently when the creature attacks it leaves stinger much like bee or wasp leaving one of these in the victim body it takes over the victim very rapidly and the entwining is far far too involved for conventional surgery to remove
recommendations
sorry jim the lab the science departments we re all stumped
no no he sits up
mister spock
hoarsely no won
mister spock spock leaves
bridge this is sickbay tell doctor mccoy mister spock just left here
all decks security alert locate and restrain mister spock he may be dangerous use phasers on stun if necessary spock enters the bridge and throws sulu out of his seat
must take the ship three of them wrestle him to the floor as chapel enters and hands hypo to mccoy
down must take it down mccoy sedates him
get him back to the sickbay use security restraints
the k3 indicator registers the level of pain watch as turn it on that what he been going through ve never seen anything like it no wonder the poor devils go mad
doctor mccoy captain
spock
these restraints will no longer be necessary nor will your sedatives doctor ll be able to return to duty apologise for my weakness earlier when tried to take control of the ship simply did not understand what is there to understand mister spock
am vulcan doctor pain is thing of the mind the mind can be controlled
you re only half-vulcan what about the human half of you
it is proving to be an inconvenience but it is manageable and the creature with all of its thousands of parts even now is pressuring me the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor it wants this ship but am resisting
can he control it the way he says bones
who knows jim know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him but whether he can control it hour to hour
have my own will captain let me help
need you spock but we can take any chances we ll keep you confined for while longer if you can maintain control we ll see my nephew if he regains consciousness will he go through that
yes
help them don care what it takes or costs you ve got to help them
jim aren you forgetting something there are over million colonists on that planet down there just as much your responsibility they need your help too they leave
am vulcan am vulcan there is no pain then he breaks his restraints
mister spock thought you were still confined to sickbay
was
here now where do you think you re going
have an errand on the planet surface you will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before
not likely mister spock
that is an order mister scott
aye sir and sorry have to disobey it the captain said no one was to transport down mister spock spock pushes scott aside and neck-pinches his assistant but scott has phaser in his hand when he gets up again
freeze right there mister spock or ll put you to sleep for sure this is mister scott in the transporter room get me the captain soon after kirk enters with an entourage and the other man is rubbing his shoulder
mister spock gave you an order to stay in the sickbay
until the pain was gone captain it has been discontinued by me
scotty
he said he was transporting down to the surface sir your orders were that no one was to beam down unless you authorised it and knowing mister spock determination on some things thought better hold him here until got your orders
one of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed captain we did not have clear opportunity to do so earlier when was attacked since my nervous system is already affected as you pointed out doctor don believe they can do much more to me
jim this is ridiculous don want my patients running around he should be in bed
am in complete control of myself doctor the fact that am here proves that do not belong in bed
mister spock your logic as usual is inescapable beam him down stay in constant touch with us give him your phaser he ll need that too
thank you captain
energise
jim that man is sick don give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job
don have to bones we both know he is man tries to attack spock but is neck-pinched after struggling to regain his self-control spock returns to the courtyard of the gel-creatures he phasers one off the lintel and puts it into metal box kirk and mccoy enter
come in gentlemen believe you ll find this interesting mccoy scans spock doctor your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable but assure you all right
you may be controlling the pain mister spock but you re far from all right
unimportant at the moment doctor please observe interesting gentlemen one-celled creature resembling more than anything else huge individual brain cell
yes that would answer lot of questions
do you understand what suggesting captain
think so this may be one cell in larger organism an incredibly huge organism in fact
and although it is not physically connected to the other cells it is nevertheless part of the whole creature guided by the whole drawing its strength from the whole which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons
existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it that it may have come here planet by planet from an entirely different galaxy
from place where our physical laws do not apply we may therefore find it difficult to destroy captain
but not impossible mister spock the denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free that he won that the angle to work on gentlemen want an analysis of all this from medical and life science departments within the hour
yes sir kirk leaves then mccoy later chapel is working with mccoy when kirk enters
sorry captain ve tried everything can variant radiation intense heat even as great as nine thousand degrees
then you re wasting your time there has to be something that ll kill the creature without destroying the human host
which happens to be my point the thing won die even at temperatures and radiation which would burn spock and your nephew to ashes
can accept that bones we ve got fourteen science labs aboard this ship the finest equipment and computers in the galaxy
captain understand your concern your affection for spock the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother family
no no bones there more than two lives at stake here cannot let it spread beyond this colony even if it means destroying million people down there captain log stardate 3289 am faced with the most difficult decision of my life unless we find way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts my command responsibilities will force me to kill over million people
gentlemen
regret see no other choice for you captain we already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations perhaps more
gentlemen want it stopped too but not at the cost of destroying over million people
including myself doctor and captain kirk young nephew understandably upsetting but once it spreads past here there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people
if killing five people saves ten it bargain is that your simple logic mister spock
will accept neither of those alternatives gentlemen cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet nor do intend to kill million or more people to stop it want another answer putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me want that third alternative
report
sorry jim we ve been over and over it made every conceivable test
therefore request permission to beam down to the planet surface also suggest that your nephew accompany me
request denied
captain do not make this request lightly do not know how much longer can hold out against the pain but do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness
request denied there must be another answer something in the sun killed that thing before the denevan died all right all right we ve tried heat radiation what other qualities or properties does the sun have
it exists physically it occupies space it has mass therefore gravity it converts matter to energy
jim we ve been through it and through it radiation heat
but one other thing you haven mentioned it bright it radiates blinding light if you re close enough
nothing lethal about light
not to us but down on the surface the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part suppose they weren simply hiding suppose they re sensitive to light light like in sun close up
possibility
you can move deneva closer to the sun jim
no but you can move the equivalent of the sun to deneva mister spock
yes in essence it can be done string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium
well can rig test cubicle in the bio-lab put our specimen in it but don
good let get on it chapel puts the creature jar into large chamber
your figures are of course accurate
of course the light of the sun at the proximity where the denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch if this works the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in closed darkened area will be affected by it
ready doctor
put on your masks they cover their eyes with goggles while the light is shone in the chamber
completed they open the chamber the thing is still
it worked we can do it what the matter jim we can do it
it worked in lab with the creature exposed to everything we can give it but what about the people who are infected
well don know maybe trial
maybe there no time for maybes bones we need to know now
but have to put
yes we have to put someone who infected under that light
do you have any idea of the risk
we have to duplicate the conditions on the planet and spock
captain you ll need host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body am the logical choice
do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves
there no other way bones we have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the denevan declared himself freed
all right ll rig up protective pair of goggles
there ll be none on the planet surface doctor
agree completely
unfortunately you re both right it the only thing we can do all right mister spock spock enters the experimental chamber
mister spock the best first officer in the fleet
proceed spock sits facing the light source and gets the full blast
completed they open the chamber and spock stands
spock are you all right
the creature within me is gone am free of it and the pain he walks forward straight into table
and also quite blind an equitable trade doctor thank you they help him into chair and chapel rushes in
doctor the results of the first tests on the creature remains she leaves
reading oh no
what is it
threw the total spectrum of light at the creature it wasn necessary didn stop to think that only one kind of light might ve killed it
interesting just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see
are you telling me that spock need not have been blinded
didn need to throw the blinding white light at all jim spock
doctor it was my selection as well it is done
bones take care of him
completing the seeding orbit captain two hundred and ten ultraviolet satellites now in position seventy two miles altitude permanent orbit about the planet
good scanners
scanners ready sir kirk; very well ready helm
ready captain
satellite control this is the captain energise all satellites
all satellites operative captain down on the planet gel-creatures are dropping to the ground and dissolving
captain receiving messages from ground station
report
the things are dying sir it working
sickbay
mccoy here
tell spock it worked
yes captain he ll be happy to hear that
bones it wasn your fault
bones later
yeoman record this for starfleet command
ready sir
the alien creatures on deneva have been destroyed
captain look mister spock spock walks onto the bridge followed by mccoy
spock you can see
the blindness was temporary jim there something about his optical nerves which aren the same as human
an hereditary trait captain the brightness of the vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid which acts as shield against high-intensity light totally instinctive doctor we tend to ignore it as you ignore your own appendix
mister spock regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most you presume felt nothing
quite the contrary captain had very strong reaction my first sight was the face of doctor mccoy bending over me
tis pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty mister spock
if you gentlemen are finished would you mind laying in course for starbase ten mister spock
my pleasure captain
unusual eye arrangement might ve known he turn up with something like that
what that doctor
said please don tell spock said he was the best first officer in the fleet
why thank you doctor mccoy
you ve been so concerned about his vulcan eyes doctor you forgot about his vulcan ears ahead warp factor one mister sulu
warp factor one sir yeoman is distributing coffees when mccoy enters
all clear ahead captain the sensors indicate zero register
forward readings mister spock
gravimetric readings no significant change zero space density
ahead warp factor three mister sulu colony beta six wants their supplies let get across this void in hurry
void star desert the word conjures up pictures of dunes oases mirages
sunlight palm trees we re nine hundred light years from that kind of desert bones
the precise meaning of the word desert is waterless barren wasteland fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such place
that doesn surprise me mister spock can imagine mirage ever disturbing those mathematically perfect brain waves of yours
thank you doctor mccoy moving on schedule into quadrant nine oh four beta six is eight days distant
something mister spock
unusual captain now getting sizable space-displacement reading
can you verify that navigator
no sir forward sweeps are negative wait verified sir we must be in some sort of light warp or we have picked it up earlier
put it on visual purple globe appears on the viewscreen
iron-silica body planet sized magnitude one we ll be passing close
inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records
and yet here it is no time to investigate science stations gather data for computer banks uhura notify the discovery on subspace radio
strong interference on subspace captain the planet must be natural radio source
let get out of its range veer forty degrees to starboard mister sulu
forty degrees he reaches for the switch and sways as if dizzy then stands up and vanishes
sulu he dashes to sulu station then suddenly stops and disappears too
mister spock they re gone
emergency full reverse power ship log stardate 2124 first officer spock reporting for captain james kirk we are orbiting the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert for four hours we have made every possible instrument sweep but captain kirk and helmsman sulu remain unaccounted for have placed the ship on red alert enterprise is now orbiting red planet with white whispy clouds
we ve searched again from stem to stern if they re not down on that planet they re nowhere
no sign of human life on the surface sir unless the instruments aren functioning
function is normal continuous sensor sweeps lieutenant uhura have you checked all wave bands
all of them mister spock no response
with due respect sir request permission to transport to the surface immediately and carry out search
second desalle request what are we waiting for
the decision will be mine doctor have the responsibility for your safety to sulu replacement mister jaeger describe your geophysical findings for the surface below
no detectable soil or vegetation extremely hot toxic atmosphere swept by tornadic storm continuous volcanic eruptions deadly to any lifeforms such as we know it without oxygen and life-support systems
estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down there
not very long
mister spock look words are appearing on the monitor above her head in gothic script spock reads them out loud
greetings and felicitations hmm send this lieutenant uss enterprise to signaler on planet surface identify self the reply comes up on the monitor
hip hip hoorah and believe it pronounced tally ho
some kind of joke sir
ll entertain any theories mister desalle any at all
one thing is certain obviously there life on that planet
you re quite correct doctor prepare transporter room
request assignment to the search party sir
no mister scott neither you nor can be spared here mister desalle equip the landing party with full communications armament and life-support gear mister jaeger your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there doctor mccoy will accompany if those peculiar signals are coming from captain kirk or lieutenant sulu their rationality is in question dismissed ve locked onto their original source
very good transmit coordinates to mister scott once on the planet surface you ll establish contact with us immediately use the laser beacon if necessary ready scott
ready mister spock
activate the landing party arrive on grass amidst trees and shrubs jaeger starts scanning immediately
where are your storms jaeger
atmosphere exactly the same as ours he takes of his oxygen mask sniffs and signals that the other two can do the same
desalle to enterprise desalle to enterprise it doesn function we re cut off
trying his own communicator no response
to jaeger keep trying with yours something blocking the beacon ve got to find open ground he wanders off through the shrubs
mister jaeger mccoy they join him to see stone building in the gothic style with an iron-bound oak door they approach cautiously and enter the place is stuffed full of things bust of napoleon on stand suit of armour globe tapestry and swords and shields on the walls an open fire harpsichord and large mirror
in the name of heaven where are we they head down steps into the room past the salt monster in an alcove
look sulu and kirk are displayed in mini-minstrel gallery mccoy scans them
there no reading they re like waxworks figures the main door slams shut and there man in an embroidered coat playing the harpsichord
must say they make perfectly exquisite display pair but suppose you want them back now he waves his hand and the two men come back to life
where are we
welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of gothos
what happened fill me in
you disappeared from the bridge after sulu we ve been looking for you for four hours
you must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here but when saw you passing by simply could not resist
captain james kirk of the united starship enterprise
ah so you re the captain of these brave lads my greetings and felicitations captain so good of you and your officers to drop in absolutely smashing
who are you where do you come from general trelane retired at your service sirs my home is your home he goes back to his playing
we ve lost contact with the ship captain we re trapped here
can tell you how delighted am to have visitors from the very planet that ve made my hobby yes but according to my observations didn think you capable of such voyages
notice the period captain nine hundred light years from earth it what might be seen through viewing scope if it were powerful enough
ah yes ve been looking in on the doings on your lively little earth
then you ve been looking in on the doings nine hundred years past
oh really have made an error in time how fallible of me oh did so want to make you feel at home quite proud of the detail
general trelane
retired sir just squire trelane now and you may call me squire yes rather fancy that
for what purpose have you imprisoned us here
imprisoned nonsense you re my guests you see just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society you came by at the most propitious moment want to know all about your campaigns your battles your missions of conquest
our missions are peaceful not for conquest when we do battle it is only because we have no choice
ah but that the official story eh
must ask you to let us go back to our ship
wouldn hear of it you shall join me in repast want to learn all about your feelings on war and killing and conquest that sort of thing do you know that you re one of the few predator species that preys even on itself kirk returns to the main group where desalle has his hand on his phaser
not yet put it on stun not to kill desalle
desalle did you say un vrai francais
my ancestry is french yes
ah monsieur vive la gloire vive napoleon you know admire your napoleon very much
this is mister desalle our navigator doctor mccoy our medical officer mister sulu our helmsman and carl jaeger meteorologist
welcome good physicianer and honourable sir bows low
is he kidding
und offizier jaeger und der deutsche soldat nein gives little prussian salute then marches around eins zwei drei vier gehen vir mit dem schiessgewehr
scientist not military man
oh come now we re all military men under the skin and how we do love our uniforms trelane is admiring himself in his mirror when he spots desalle raising his weapon and with wave of the hand stops him
what an interesting weapon you ve got there do let me see it he takes it out of desalle hand and he can move again
yes now let me see how does this work ah yes this won kill and this will he fires it at the salt monster who is disintegrated
oh how marvellous destroys another exhibit devastating why this could kill millions kirk takes it off him
who will you start with my crew are we your next targets
oh how absolutely typical of your species you don understand something so you become fearful now do let me anticipate your next question you want to know how ve managed all of this
that correct
we meaning and others have to state the matter briefly perfected system by which matter can be transferred to energy and back to matter again
like the transporter system aboard the enterprise
oh crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated process you see we not only transport matter from place to place but we can alter its shape at will
this drawing room did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet
quite
see how did you manage
dear captain your inquiries are becoming tiresome want you to be happy free yourself of care let enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship
come on let go we re getting out of here
tut tut tut you re being quite rude you can go apparently you need another demonstration of my authority yes quite kirk vanishes from the room and is in the natural atmosphere of the planet choking on the fumes everyone in the room can hear him trelane brings him back now that sample of the atmosphere of this planet outside my kindly influence now you will behave yourself hereafter won you or shall be very very angry captain log stardate 2125 science officer spock reporting for captain kirk we have completed fourteenth orbit of this planet without establishing contact with our missing officers or the parties sent to find them subspace communications remain blocked however by diverting impulse power to our sensors we have made them operable and we have detected one small area on the surface which seems relatively stable
aye it there mister spock peaceful as earth but how do you explain it
don mister scott it simply exists artificial perhaps or freak of nature the fact remains that life can exist in that area
aye it could but it couldn move around much
apply fine tuning on our sensors locate any life forms in that stable area
if we find any it doesn follow that it would be our people
affirmative but if the captain is down there and alive that where he ll have to be we ll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect
shooting in the dark mister spock
or stand by and do nothing mister scott trelane is showing off his decor and this of course is an array of your battle flags and pennants dating back to the crusades to hannibal invaders the grecian war galleys and the hordes of persia can you imagine it captain the thousands of men marching off to their deaths singing beneath these banners doesn it make your blood run swiftly then he goes back to his music
captain where could he possibly come from who is this maniac
better say what is he monitored him and what found was unbelievable
not alive
not in the way we define life no trace zero
you mean it shows he dead
it doesn even show that he exists at all alive or dead
notice the wood fire captain burning steadily ember bed glowing and it doesn give off any heat at all
fire without heat mistaking all this for present day earth without taking into account the time differential whatever we re dealing with he certainly isn all knowledgeable he makes mistakes
discussing deep laid plans ll wager cannot wait to see them evolve
trelane we haven planned
tut tut do not think that deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem quite the contrary have nothing but admiration for your whole species
if your admiration is genuine you must have respect for our sense of duty too our ship has need of us we have tasks to perform
oh can let you go now was getting bit bored until you came you must stay insist
for how long
until this is over of course
until what is over
dear captain so many questions make the most of an uncertain future enjoy yourself today tomorrow may never come at all
trelane even if we wanted to stay our companions are missing us
yes must experience your sense of concern your grief at the separation
there are four hundred men and women aboard that ship
women do you mean that you actually have members of the fairer sex among your crew oh how charming and they must be all very beautiful and shall be so very gallant to them here let me fetch them down at once
grabbing his arm no
no
this game has gone on long enough those are crucial operating personnel you can
can do anything want should think you would have realised that by now
captain receiving transporter signal
transporter signal what does he mean you must tell me
it means trelane the party over thanks to mister spock
as the group is beamed away wait won have this haven dismissed you yet stop won have this
everyone to stations report mister spock how were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field
they didn captain not clearly we merely beamed up all life forms in given area
which means trelane is not life form as we know it or he be beaming through now
prepare to warp out of here at once maximum speed
blonde yeoman oh captain was so worried
scotty we re going to need every ounce of your engines we re going to put hundred million miles between us and that madman
quaking but don know if it from laughter or terror
doctor what was it what was down there
well it was oh forget it
look trelane has appeared on the bridge
where are all your weapons captain don you display your weapons
trelane
don fret captain only bit upset with you but this mister spock you mentioned the one responsible for that unseemly impudent act of taking you from me which is he
am spock
surely not an officer he isn quite human is he
my father is from the planet vulcan
and are its natives predatory
not generally but there have been exceptions
really you will see to his punishment
on the contrary commend his action
but don like him
get off my ship
oh rot you re all going back with me
we re not going anywhere
nonsense have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on gothos planned for all of you and you shan spoil it for me anyway the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate lot of the clutter in the middle of the room has been replaced by fully furnished dining table and six high-backed chairs sulu and desalle are already seated
and tasteful don you agree
no
but so much more fitting honourable sir
getting up you
desalle trelane stops him
oh what primitive fury why he the very soul of sublime savagery
trelane let him go he does and sulu grabs desalle
we haven even got our phasers
yes of course forget that shouldn frighten you too much but warn you you can provoke me again come everyone let forget your bad manners let be full of merry talk and sallies of wit we have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to delight the mind come doctor do partake ah you ve been quite derelict in your social duties captain you haven introduced me to the charming contingent of your crew
this is general trelane
retired but if you prefer you may address me as the lonely squire of gothos dear ladies
lieutenant uhura of communications
ah nubian prize he kisses her hand taken on one of your raids of conquest no doubt captain
no doubt
she has the melting eyes of the queen of sheba the same lovely colouring and this is this the face that launched thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium fair helen make me immortal with kiss
holding trelane back yeoman teresa ross believe you have met our science officer mister spock
you do realise don you that it in deference to the captain that brought you here
affirmative
don know if like your tone it most challenging that what you re doing challenging me
object to you object to intellect without discipline object to power without constructive purpose
oh mister spock you do have one saving grace after all you re ill-mannered the human half of you no doubt to ross ah come my little wood nymph won you dance with your swain to uhura give us some sprightly music my dear girl
don know how to play this
of course you do and she does as trelane dances with ross
captain how far do we go along with this charade
until we can think our way out meanwhile we accept his hospitality
you should taste his food straw would taste better than his meat and water hundred times better than his brandy nothing has any taste at all
it may be unappetizing doctor but it is very logical
there that magic word again does your logic find this fascinating mister spock
fascinating is word use for the unexpected in this case should think interesting would suffice
you don find this unexpected mister spock
that his food has no taste his wine no flavour no it simply means that trelane knows all of the earth forms but none of the substance
and if he fallible he can be all powerful which means he has something helping him
evidently
machine device something which does these things for him
ah my dear don we make graceful pair except for one small detail that dress hardly matches this charming scene suddenly she wearing an empire line dress with feathers in her hair idealised jane austen
ah yes that more what we want the dashing warrior and his elegant lady
that mirror it part of his audience his ego he never wanders from it
is it ego or something else
explain
the mirror
what about it
you noted yourself he never gets very far from it suppose it could be vanity
no no mister spock that not the reason what kind of machine could do these things
machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves it would have very complex memory bank and would be extremely sophisticated kirk; like computer only much more could the machine that maintains the environment in this immediate area be kept in this house
think not device capable of keeping out this planet natural atmosphere would be immense
good agree that leaves me free
free captain
if not mistaken mister spock think can turn his lights off at the source raises his voice don be too upset by what you see gentlemen after all his actions are those of an immature unbalanced mind
overheard that remark captain afraid ll have to dispense with you
you only heard part of it just started
oh
yes want you to leave my crewmen alone want you to leave my crewwomen alone too to ross you re not to dance with him don like it
does it actually make you angry captain
removing one of her long gloves don want you accepting his gifts either
captain please don do this
well do believe the dear captain is jealous of me
don care what you believe just keep your hands off her
oh how curiously human how wonderfully barbaric
ve had enough of your insulting attentions to her
of course you have after all that the root of the matter isn it you fight for the attention the admiration the possession of women
if it fighting that you want slaps trelane you may have it
are you challenging me to duel
if you have the courage
oh this is better than planned shall not shirk an affair of honour he gets box from the mantle-shelf it contains pair of duelling pistols
matched set just like the pair that slew your heroic alexander hamilton and captain never miss captain log stardate 2126 delayed report the whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls himself trelane we are weaponless powerless and our only hope of escape with the enterprise lies in playing his games ve decided to make my move with the field of honour game and everything depends on my one chance with the ancient duelling pistol
oh how fascinating party to an actual human duel
are you ready
quite ready sir we shall test each other courage and then and then we shall see
enough talk let get on with it
as you will sir honour will be served eh oh wait as the one challenged claim the first shot
we shoot together
it my game and my rules but if you need to be persuaded aims at spock
all right
captain trelane takes aim then fires his pistol at the ceiling instead
and now captain how do you have the expression my fate is in your hands so kirk shoots the mirror and everything goes hay-wire in the room
you ve ruined everything
the machine
captain subspace interference is clearing
try to contact the ship
oh the remarkable treachery of the species
go on trelane look at it it over your power is blanked out you re finished
you ve earned my wrath go back go back to your ship all of you and prepare you re all dead men you especially captain he goes to his mirror and vanishes
trelane everyone we re getting out of here now this is the captain commence beaming up maximum speed the men are already at their posts when the women arrive and yeoman ross hasn even got changed yet
set course for colony beta six
laid in sir
full power acceleration from orbit mister scott
emergency warp at the earliest possible moment mister sulu
standing by to warp sir
shall make full report to spacefleet command sir
not yet they may trace our beam wait until we re well out of range
can we know his range is captain
we can take an educated guess at the point we entered their solar system
still no sign of pursuit instruments clear sir
good
may take moment to change
yes think you might turn in your glass slippers the ball is over
gladly captain
hard to believe it ever happened
captain we re about to warp
large body ahead the planet swims back onto the viewscreen
collision course
hard to port mister sulu
that was the planet gothos captain
gothos mister sulu have we been going in circles
no sir all instruments show on course
gothos again captain
hard over mister sulu
cat and mouse game
with us as the mouse
there it is again dead ahead
ninety degrees to starboard mister sulu
turning captain nut not veering off from it
ninety degrees sub-port mister sulu adjust
turn completed and still accelerating toward the planet
or it toward us
decelerate into orbit prepare transporter room
captain you re not beaming down
yes am doctor mccoy am going to see our playful mister trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship stand by communications mister spock if you don receive message from me within the hour leave the vicinity at once no turning back the bright drawing-room is now an austere courtroom with trelane as the gowned and be-wigged judge
the prisoner may approach the bench
trelane
any attempt at demonstrations will weigh against you with the court and this time my instrumentality is unbreakable silhouette of noose appears on the wall behind kirk
ve had enough of your games
oh the absurdity of these inferior beings reading from the charge sheet and now captain james kirk you stand accused of the high crime of treason against superior authority conspiracy and the attempt to foment insurrection how do you plead
haven come to plead in your court trelane
warn you anything you might say has already been taken down in evidence against you
ve come for one purpose to get back my ship
irrelevant
we ve made you angry with our will to survive haven we
uncalled for
then vent your anger on me alone was the one who led the others was the one who shot out your mirror machine
and did you really think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command
took that chance willing to pay the price for chancing wrong
oh then you do admit to the charge
yes anything just allow the enterprise to continue its journey you pompous
immaterial kirk leaves the dock and goes nose to nose with trelane
those people have done you no harm
inadmissible
we re living beings not playthings for your amusement
silence this trial is over you are guilty on all counts you are guilty and according to your own laws this court has no choice in fixing punishment you will hang by the neck captain until you are dead dead dead captain log stardate 2126 first officer spock reporting still no word from captain kirk on the surface below us waiting time is almost up will soon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions
until moment ago didn think it possible but it was takes off his robes and wig did it was angry actually experienced genuine rage this experiment has been successful
glad you weren disappointed
why captain you re still angry would that could have sustained that moment ah no matter do you have last request
trelane if you think going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose
you still haven learned you have no choice oh this is becoming quite tiresome it all so very easy
that your problem trelane everything is easy it given you bad habit you re not aware of it but you have it you don think trelane that your problem you miss opportunities like your anger before and mine right now oh you enjoy it but you couldn have accomplished it without me and you know why because you re bumbling inept fool
take care now
here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique and you re wasting it you want to commit murder go ahead but where the sport in simple hanging
the sport
yes the terror of murder the suspense the fun
oh intrigued go ahead captain what do you suggest
personal conflict between us not like the duel before but the real thing the stakes human life mine
waving sword around yes yes
that the idea
oh then you approve
yes but you can do better than that there still not enough sport in just killing me with sword
know that will be dull we ll have to have something more fanciful let me see hunt royal hunt predator against predator now you may go hide in the forest anywhere you like and shall seek how does that strike you captain
it strikes me very well but you ll have to make it worth my while trelane why not up the stakes
the stakes
yes while we re playing our game free my ship let it continue on its way in return ll give you contest you ll remember
always back to your ship oh well if it will add spice to the pursuit accept your terms captain kirk is outside the building quickly
let me notify the enterprise that it can go kirk; enterprise enterprise this is kirk can you hear me static get the ship away as fast as you can ll try and give you the time you need can you hear me trelane appears out of thin air
ah-ha kirk dodges him and runs into the shrubs kirk; enterprise
ah ha captain kirk you must try harder captain this is too easy they keep dodging amongst the shrubs
enterprise enterprise can you hear me kirk takes an opportunity to get trelane sword off him but when he takes swing at his foe he just disappears and reappears again
touche captain touche must confess you scored first but after all never played this game before sword appears in his hand
and now let have at it again kirk fences trelane with branch but it breaks and he has to run off leaving trelane laughing the door will not open
enterprise enterprise
ah-ha tallyho iron grids pen kirk in you made noble fight of it captain
remember trelane you promised to let my ship go
yes but this is such sport must fetch all the others back to play so this is victory it has sweet taste down captain on your knees
you haven won trelane
have could run you through
but you haven won anything
on your knees captain
no does it still taste as sweet
order you you ve been beaten
but not defeated
order you order you kirk disarms him and snaps the sword across his knee you broke it you broke my sword
you ve got lot to learn about winning trelane
you dare to defy me
in fact you ve got lot to learn about everything haven you kirk slaps his face
ll fix you for that you cheated you haven played the game right ll show you
trelane two green flashing lights appear and trelane steps into their spotlight
no no you said could have this planet
this has gone far enough
you always stop me when having fun
you re disobedient and cruel we ve told you before
time to come in now trelane
but don want to come in and won general and won listen to you
enough trelane come along
but why didn do anything wrong was just playing
we said come along
but haven finished studying my predators yet
this is not studying them
if you cannot take proper care of your pets you cannot have them at all
oh but was winning was winning
they re beings trelane they have spirit they re superior
no no you saw
you ll grow up trelane you ll understand now come along
oh but you said could you promised never have any fun
stop that nonsense at once or you ll not be permitted to make any more planets
oh but you saw was winning would have won honest
no trelane
no trelane the spotlight contracts and trelane gradually vanishes
would have would have would have would would would would
captain we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed
who are you who is trelane
you must forgive our child the fault is ours for indulging him too much he will be punished
we would not have let him intercept you had we realised your vulnerability
forgive us captain we will maintain your life-support conditions while you return to your ship please accept our apologies the lights disappear
captain to enterprise captain to enterprise
beam me up mister spock we re free to go
warping down captain our warp factor four
approach channels clear captain
colony beta six clears us for normal approach sir
normal orbit approach procedures mister sulu
captain
mister spock still thinking about trelane is that it
for the record how do we describe him pure mentality force of intellect embodied energy superbeing he must be classified sir
god of war mister spock
hardly find that fitting
then small boy and very naughty one at that
it will make strange entry in the library banks
then he was very strange small boy one the other hand he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were boy
mischievous pranks captain
yes dipping little girls curls in inkwells stealing apples from the neighbours trees tying cans on he stopped by the look of horrified incredulity on spock face
forgive me mister spock should have known better
shall be delighted captain
approaching omicron ceti three sir
standard orbit mister painter
yes sir
captain
yes lieutenant
ve been transmitting contact signal every five minutes all get is dead air shall continue
maintain transmission pattern until we ve established orbit
aye aye sir
mister spock there were one hundred and fifty men women and children in that colony what are the chances of survivors
absolutely none captain berthold rays are such recent discovery we do not yet have full knowledge of their nature it is known however that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure sandoval group could not have survived after three years
are you saying that those people built future in place knowing they might not survive
am saying they knew there was risk
and what about us can we afford to send people to the planet surface
the breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately we can risk limited exposure
we ve established orbit sir and ve pinpointed settlement
thank you mister painter mister spock equip landing party of five to accompany me to the planet surface include doctor mccoy and biologist ll want them in ten minutes the group beam down into farm complete with wooden fence and tarmacadamed paths there are clap-board buildings and even stable block
another dream that failed there nothing sadder it took these people year to make the trip from earth they came all that way and died
hardly that sir welcome to omicron ceti three elias sandoval captain log stardate 3417 we thought our mission to omicron ceti three would be an unhappy one we had expected to find no survivors of the agricultural colony there apparently our information was incorrect
we haven seen anyone outside our group for four years since we left earth we ve been expecting someone for some time our subspace radio didn work properly and afraid we didn have anyone who could master its intricacies
actually mister sandoval we didn come here because of your silent radio
it makes little difference captain you re here we re happy to see you come let me show you our settlement
on pure speculation just an educated guess say that man is alive
captain this planet is being bombarded by berthold rays as our reports indicated at this intensity we ll be safe for week if necessary but
but these people shouldn be alive
is it possible that they re not
you shook hands with him jim his flesh was warm he alive there no doubt about that
there also no question of the fact that berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly there no miracle connected with it doctor you know that no cures no serums no antidotes if man is exposed long enough he dies
gentlemen we re debating in vacuum let go get some answers elias leads the way into comfortable room with wooden furniture and gingham curtains
there are two other settlements but we have forty five colonists here
what was the reason for the dispersal
we felt three groups would have better potential if disease were to strike one group the others would be less likely to be affected you see omicron is an ideal agricultural planet we determined not to suffer the fate of expeditions that went before us
elias
leila come meet our guests this is leila kalomi our botanist this is captain kirk doctor mccoy mister spock
mister spock and have met before it been long time
mister sandoval we do have mission here examinations tests
by all means make them think you ll find our settlement an interesting one our philosophy is simple one that men should return to less complicated life we have few mechanical things here no vehicles no weapons we have harmony here complete peace
we ll try not to interfere with your work
make yourselves at home gentlemen
what exactly are we looking for anyway sir
whatever doesn look right whatever that is when it comes to farms wouldn know what looked right or wrong if it were two feet from me you mean like that weird alien plant right next to you
opening up the barn door hey
what is it
no cows this barn isn even built for them just for storage
come to think of it we haven seen any animals no horses no pigs not even dog nothing
you ve known the vulcanian
on earth six years ago
did you love him
if did it was important only to myself
how did he feel
mister spock feelings were never expressed to me it is said he has none to give
would you like him to stay with us now to be as one of us
there is no choice elias he will stay in another part of the farmhouse mccoy is conducting medical examinations
that ll be all thank you very much the man leaves kirk enters
anything
ve examined nine men so far varying in ages from twenty three to fifty nine they re all in perfect condition text book responses heart lungs excellent co-ordination excellent reflexes excellent if there are many more of them could throw away my shingle communicator beeps
kirk here
spock here captain there seems to be total absence of life on the planet with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora
not at the moment sir am conducting various tests with the tricorder but results are inconclusive
very well continue investigations kirk out
no animals that peculiar
yes especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes apparently none of them survived
like to see the medical records on the expedition
yes thought you might hands over computer disc
captain ve been looking for you you haven seen our fields and crops like to show you and the doctor what we ve accomplished here
afraid ll have to bow out have to continue with these medical examinations however if find everyone else health to be as perfect as yours
he promised to throw away his shingle
you ll find no weaklings here captain
this is the reason captain this soil will grow anything we plant in it it perfect world we have moderate climate moderate rains all year round it gives us all we need it is perfect
pardon me captain biology report ready sir
have work to attend to myself captain he leaves them
go ahead lieutenant
heard sandoval saying they could grow anything here that true sir they ve got variety of crops in grains potatoes beans
make your point
well sir for an agricultural colony they have actually very little acreage planted there enough to sustain the colony but very little more
it like jigsaw puzzle all one colour no key to where the pieces fit in why communicator beeps
kirk here
this is mccoy jim think you better get back here
trouble
no but like you to see this for yourself
on my way
sandoval medical record four years ago when the expedition left earth he registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was child no major operations but there was an appendectomy received all required inoculations et cetera
what so strange about that
nothing but examined that man no more than two hours ago you know what his readings were perfect perfect and perfect just like everyone else ve examined here
instrument malfunction
no thought of that and tested it on myself it accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs had once it did not record the scar tissue on sandoval lungs but it did record healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed spock is scanning amongst the rows of dry-looking somethings
nothing not even insects yet your plants grow and you ve survived exposure to berthold rays
that can be explained
please do
later
have never understood the female capacity to avoid direct answer to any question
and never understood you until now there was always place in here where no one could come there was only the face you allow people to see only one side you allow them to know
would like to know how your people have managed to survive here
missed you
logically you should all be dead
if tell you how we survived will you try to understand how we feel about our life here about each other
emotions are alien to me scientist
someone else might believe that your shipmates your captain but not me come
mister sandoval within the hour ve received orders from starfleet command to evacuate all personnel from this colony naturally you ll inform your people to begin preparations we will have accommodations for you aboard the enterprise
no
it not an arbitrary decision on my part have my orders
captain it entirely unnecessary we re in no danger here
we ve explained the berthold rays to you and their effect can you understand
doctor how can make you understand your own instruments have shown that we re all in perfect health we ve had no deaths here
what about your animals
we re vegetarians
that doesn answer my question sir why did all your animals die
captain you stress very unimportant matters we will not leave the grass is brown and dry but the pink flowers are growing
it not much further
you ve not yet explained the nature of this thing
its basic properties and elements are not important what is important is it gives life peace love
what you re describing was once known in the vernacular as happiness pill and you as scientist should know that that not possible
come was one of the first to find them the spores
spores one of the pink flowers shoots things at him spock clutches his head and falls to the ground in pain
no
it shouldn hurt
no can please don
not like this it didn hurt us
am not like you suddenly the pain is gone
now now you belong to all of us and we to you there no need to hide your inner face any longer we understand
love you can love you they kiss captain log supplemental we have been ordered by starfleet command to evacuate the colony on omicron three however the colony leader elias sandoval has refused all co-operation and will not listen to any arguments
sandoval
captain your arguments are very valid but they do not apply to us
you re being unreasonable
well nevertheless excuse me
excuse me my orders are to remove all the colonists that exactly what intend to do with or without your help elias; without should think
would you like to use butterfly net on him captain
no think we ll use
captain we ve checked out everything it all seems normal except for the absence of any animals
we have orders to evacuate all colonists to starbase twenty seven want landing parties to co-ordinate the colonists and prepare them for transport up to the ship we ll need extra accommodations aboard where mister spock and mister desalle
we haven seen them since we began our check
desalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found did spock call in at all
no he didn gets out communicator spock see to the landing parties would you mister sulu
yes sir
spock spock communicator is beeping to itself while he is lying in leila lap looking at the clouds he has changed out of his uniform into an overall
that one looks like dragon you see the tail and the dorsal spines
ve never seen dragon
have on berengaria seven but ve never stopped to look at clouds before or rainbows you know can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky but considering its beauty has always been out of the question
not here she picks up the communicator and it opens
yes what did you want
spock is that you
yes captain what did you want
don believe want to tell you
spock don know what you think you re doing but this is an order report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes we re evacuating all colonists to starbase twenty seven
no don think so
you don think so what
don think so sir
spock report to me immediately but the communicator drops to the ground during another kiss
spock the frequency is open but he doesn answer
that didn sound at all like spock jim
no thought you said you might like him if he mellowed little
didn say that
you said that
not exactly he might be in trouble
yes take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard
how will you find spock
the frequency is open it ll act as homing device contact desalle have him meet you here make sure the landing party work in teams of two don want anybody left alone down here they find the communicator and hear laughter spock is hanging upside down from branch of nearby tree
spock clears throat mister spock items are being collected to be taken up to the ship desalle has brought some of the pink plants
what are you doing with those things desalle
want you to take close look at these doc they re very interesting
mister spock are you out of your mind you were told to report to me at once
didn want to jim
you yes can see that miss kalomi you ll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship
there ll be no evacuation jim but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out
mister sulu mister spock is under arrest and he in your custody until we get back to the enterprise
very well come with me he takes leila hand and leads the group to clump of the plants where they all get sprayed with spores
what
mister sulu understands don you mister sulu
yes see now of course we can remove the colony it be wrong
don know what these plants are or how they work but you re all going back to the settlement with me and those colonists are going aboard the ship kirk leaves them
can see the captain is going to be difficult no equipment or colonists now just plants going up to the ship
with an extreme southern drawl ready to beam up hiya jimmy boy hey ve taken care of everything all all gotta do is relax doctor orders
how many of those did you beam up
oh must be nigh onto hundred by now plants
this is the captain beam me up
most certainly do energise
lieutenant put me through to admiral komack at starfleet
oh sorry captain can do that
what do you mean you can do that follow standard procedure that an order
oh know it is captain but you see all communications are out
out
short-circuited them except ship to surface we ll need that for while it really for the best captain she leaves the bridge kirk finds plant and throws it angrily across the helm console before storming out himself there long queue of crewmembers lounging against the wall outside the transporter room
get back to your stations get back to your stations
sorry sir we re all transporting down to join the colony
said get back to your station
no sir
this is mutiny mister
yes sir it is captain log stardate 3417 the pod plants have spread spores throughout the ship carried by the ventilation system under their influence my crew is deserting to join the omicron colony and can stop them don know why have not been infected nor can get doctor mccoy to explain the physical-psychological aspects of the infection
not interested in any physical-psychological aspects jim boy we all perfectly healthy down here
ve heard that word lot lately perfect everything perfect
ll bet you ve even grown your tonsils back
sho nuf hey jim boy all ever have real cold georgia-style mint julep huh
look bones need your help can you run tests blood samples anything at all to give us lead on what these things are how to counteract them
who wants to counteract paradise jim boy
bones bones spock is pouring tea
almost the entire ship complement has beamed down
very pleased the entire landing operation is proceeding quite well kirk enters
where mccoy
he went off to create something called mint julep that drink jim
captain why don you join us
in your own private paradise
the spores have made it that
where did they originate
it impossible to say they drifted through space until they finally landed here you see they actually thrive on berthold rays the plants act as repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find human body to inhabit
in return they give you complete health and peace of mind
that paradise
we have no need or want captain
it true eden jim there belonging and love
no wants no needs we weren meant for that none of us man stagnates if he has no ambition no desire to be more than he is
we have what we need
except challenge
you don understand jim but you ll come around sooner or later join us please
going back to the ship all the panels are lit the lights are on but nobody is home except one
engineering scotty biochemistry lab security is there anyone on board this is the captain he sits in his chair
captain log stardate 3417 except for myself all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet mutinied lieutenant uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station can only contact the surface of the planet the ship can be maintained in orbit for several months but even with automatic controls cannot pilot her alone in effect am marooned here beginning to realise just how big this ship really is how quiet don know how to get my crew back how to counteract the effect of the spores don know what can offer against paradise the plant that he had thrown earlier now sprays him with spores
enterprise to mister spock
yes jim what is it now
ve joined you understand now
wonderful jim when will you beam down
there are some things in my quarters want to pack
good leila and will meet you at the beam down point he packs suitcase with smile on his face then goes to the safe and gets out his medals he loses the smile kirk puts his suitcase on the transporter pad and goes over to the controls
no no can leave he very relieved emotions violent emotions needs anger captain log supplemental think ve discovered the answer but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk mister spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being aroused his great physical strength could kill but it risk ll have to take
spock here
what keeping you jim we ve been waiting
ve been packing some things and realise there some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement once the last of us has left
do you want me to beam up party
no think you and can handle it why don you beam up now
just moment it won take long do you mind
ll wait
ready to beam up jim
with large metal bar in his hand energising spock materialises
all right you mutinous disloyal computerised half-breed we ll see about you deserting my ship
the term half-breed is somewhat applicable but computerised is inaccurate machine can be computerised not man
what makes you think you re man you re an overgrown jackrabbit an elf with hyperactive thyroid
jim don understand
of course you don understand you don have the brains to understand all you have is printed circuits
captain if you ll excuse me
what can you expect from simpering devil-eared freak whose father was computer and his mother an encyclopedia
my mother was teacher my father an ambassador
your father was computer like his son an ambassador from planet of traitors vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity
captain please don
you re traitor from race of traitors disloyal to the core rotten like the rest of your subhuman race and you ve got the gall to make love to that girl
that enough
does she know what she getting spock carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in mushroom instead of passing himself off as man you belong in circus spock not starship right next to the dog-faced boy spock bends the metal bar with one blow and throws kirk around the transporter room with ease fortunately kirk is able to dodge the blows that damage the walls and equipment until finally
had enough didn realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours anyhow don know what you re so mad about it isn every first officer who gets to belt his captain several times
you did that to me deliberately
believe me mister spock it was painful in more ways than one
the spores they re gone don belong anymore
you said they were benevolent and peaceful violent emotions overwhelm them destroy them had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence that the answer mister spock
that may be correct captain but trying to initiate brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical
had something else in mind can you put together subsonic transmitter something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator
it can be done
good let get to work
captain striking fellow officer is court martial offence
well if we re both in the brig who going to build the subsonic transmitter
that is quite logical captain
well now it little early to be counting stars miss leila
waiting for mister spock and the captain to transport down they had some equipment to be moved but it been so long wish he come back
well now think can fix that for you enterprise spock is back in uniform and under the console when it beeps
enterprise spock here
this is leila borrowed the doctor communicator was worried something might have happened to you
yes yes quite well
can come aboard ve never seen starship before
are you still at the beam down point and is the doctor there
yes to both questions
give your communicator back to doctor mccoy you won need it to beam up it ll take few moments just wait there out
mister spock miss kalomi is strictly your concern but should you talk to her while she still under the influence of the spores
ll be back shortly captain once she materialised she rushes to put her arms around him but he doesn respond
you re no longer with us are you felt something was wrong
it was necessary
come back to the planet with me you can belong again come back with me please
can
love you said that six years ago and can seem to stop repeating myself on earth you couldn give anything of yourself you couldn even put your arms around me we couldn have anything together there we couldn have anything together anyplace else we re happy here crying can lose you now mister spock can
have responsibility to this ship to that man on the bridge am what am leila and if there are self-made purgatories then we all have to live in them mine can be no worse than someone else
have lost you haven and not only you ve lost all of it the spores ve lost them too
the captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence
and this is for my good do you mind if say still love you you never told me if you had another name mister spock
wiping away her tears you couldn pronounce it
they ll not hear this of course it ll be more sensation of feeling it
as though somebody had put itching powder on their skin
precisely it should begin to work on their nerves in few minutes
sorry desalle
what do you think you re doing
said was sorry
more like you re clumsy
if you hadn gotten in my way they fight with their spades elsewhere around the settlement fights are breaking out
come on break it up break it up mccoy is resting under tree with tall glass of mint julep in his hand
well doctor ve been thinking about what sort of work could assign you to
what do you mean what sort of work doctor
not any more of course we don need you not as doctor
oh no would you like to see how fast can put you in hospital
am the leader of this colony ll assign you whatever work think suitable
just minute you better make me mechanic then can treat little tin gods like you he punches elias sorry sandoval don know what made me do that
we ve done nothing here no accomplishments no progress three years wasted we wanted to make this planet garden
you can stay here you can survive without the spores after you ve cleared at the starbase you could be relocated it depends upon what you want
think think we like to get some work done the work we started out to do
enterprise
enterprise spock here
this is mccoy sandoval would like to talk to the captain
just moment they re all beginning to call in captain rather contritely should say sandoval wishes to speak to you
put him on the speaker kirk here
oh captain as understood it you were to transport us to starbase twenty seven we ll give you every co-operation
start making preparations mister sandoval we ll begin transporting your people aboard as soon as more of our crew checks in later when everyone is back on duty
well jim ve just examined the last of the colonists and they re all in absolutely perfect perfect health fringe benefit left over by the spores
good
well that the second time man been thrown out of paradise
no no bones this time we walked out on our own maybe we weren meant for paradise maybe we were meant to fight our way through struggle claw our way up scratch for every inch of the way maybe we can stroll to the music of the lute we must march to the
poetry captain non-regulation
we haven heard much from you about omicron ceti three mister spock
have little to say about it captain except that for the first time in my life was happy
one degree to overlap stand by to photograph now
three days of this now sir other ships must have made star maps of some of this
negative lieutenant we are the first to reach this far
sir contact with an object it moving toward us no visual contact yet
deflectors full intensity
it coming at light speed
collision course
evasive maneuvers mister sulu
object changing direction too sir keeps coming at us
getting no signal from it sir
still collision course deflectors aren stopping it
sound alarm
it slowing down mister spock
countermand alarm all engines full stop
visual contact
ahead slow steer course around it mister sulu
it blocking the way
quite unnecessary to raise your voice mister bailey all engines stop sound the alert
bridge to all decks condition alert all decks condition alert captain kirk to the bridge captain log star date 1512 on our third day of star mapping an unexplained cubical object blocked our vessel path on the bridge mister spock immediately ordered general alert my location sickbay quarterly physical check
just few seconds more
on back pumping pedals just few seconds more
that boy keep it up work up little sweat it ll will do you good notices red alert
you re killing me you re killing me
stop winded
you be the last one tell sees light goes to desk monitor kirk here what going on
what that we move it moves as well
vessel of some kind
ll be right up you could see the alarm lights flashing from there mccoy why didn you tell me
finally finished physical on you didn kirk leaves what am doctor or moon shuttle conductor if jumped every time light came on around here end up talking to myself
bridge captain to bridge
any changes here
any indication of danger from it
ll change first then captain out
all decks have reported green mister bailey
yes sir
and when the captain arrives he will expect full report on
the cube range and position ll have it by then raising my voice back there doesn mean was scared or couldn do my job it means happen to have human thing called an adrenaline gland
it does sound most inconvenient however have you considered having it removed
very funny
you try to cross brains with spock he ll cut you to pieces every time
captain to bridge
any signs of life
have you tried all hailing frequencies
have the department heads meet me on the bridge
reporting sir sensors show it is solid but its composition is unknown to us
lieutenant uhura
hailing frequencies still open sir get no message from it
navigation
distance from us fifteen hundred ninety three metres position constant
each of its edges measures one hundred seven metres mass little under eleven thousand metric tons
scotty
motive power beats me what makes it go
ll buy speculation
sell it if had any that solid cube how something like that can sense us coming block us move when we move well it beats me that my report
life sciences
same report
sir we going to just let it hold us here we ve got phaser weapons vote we blast it
ll keep that in mind mister bailey when this becomes democracy captain log star date 1513 star maps reveal no indication of habitable planets nearby origin and purpose of the cube still unknown we ve been here held motionless for eighteen hours
anything further gentlemen
believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities first space buoy of some kind
second
flypaper
and you don recommend sticking around
negative it would make us appear too weak
it time for action gentlemen mister bailey
bridge to phaser gun crew
countermand ll select what kind of action
sorry sir thought you meant
are you explaining mister bailey haven requested an explanation now as was about to say navigator plot us spiral course away from the cube
yes sir we ll try pulling away from it
yes sir helmsman to engine room stand by all decks alert we re going to try pulling away
course plotted and laid in sir
engage mister sulu quarter speed
point two five sir still blocking us sir
let see if it ll give way ahead half speed
point five oh sir
radiation from the short end of the spectrum increasing
all stop hold position
it still coming toward us range one hundred ninety metres
radiation increasing
power astern half speed
half speed
radiation nearing the tolerance level
still coming gaining on us
engines astern full speed
full speed
range one hundred twenty five metres now
helm give us warp speed
warp one sir
radiation at the tolerance level
warp two sir speed is now warp three
radiation passing the tolerance level entering lethal zone
range fifty one metres and still closing sir
phaser crew stand ready
phaser crew reports ready sir
growing we can take only few more seconds of this
lock phasers on target mister bailey lock phasers
phasers locked on target sir at point-blank range and closing
fire main phasers captain log star date 1514 the cube has been destroyed ship damage minor but my next decision major probe on ahead or turn back
nothing captain no contacts no objects in any direction
care to speculate on what we ll find if we go on ahead
speculate no logically we ll discover the intelligence which sent out the cube
intelligence different from ours or superior
probably both and if you re asking the logical decision to make
no not the mission of the enterprise is to seek out and contact alien life
has it occurred to you that there certain inefficiency in constantly questioning me on things you ve already made up your mind about
it gives me emotional security navigator set course ahead
plotted laid in sir
engage
warp one sir
mister bailey phaser crews were sluggish you were slow in locking them into your directional beam helmsman engineering decks could have been faster too programme series of simulated attacks and evasion maneuvers keep repeating the exercise until we re proficient gentlemen
yes sir
yes sir
your timing is lousy jim
your men are tired
captain quarters aren you the one who always says little suffering is good for the soul
never say that
especially worried about bailey navigator position rough enough for seasoned man
think he ll cut it
oh how so sure because you spotted something you liked in him something familiar like yourself say about oh eleven years ago
why doctor you ve been reading your textbooks again
don need textbooks to know you could ve promoted him too fast listen to that voice crews come on let get with it phaser station two where your green light
what next they re not machines jim
well they re not after what they ve been through they really should
doctor mccoy ve heard you say that man is ultimately superior to any mechanical device
no never say that either
could ve sworn heard you say that kirk here
let try for one hundred mister spock
what are you going to do with that six percent when they give it to you jim
going to take it and going to door opens
excuse me sir it past time you had something to eat sir
what the devil is this green leaves
it dietary salad sir doctor mccoy ordered your diet card changed thought you knew
your weight was up couple of pounds remember
will you stop hovering over me yeoman
well ll change it if you don like it sir
bring some for the doctor too
no no no never eat until the crew eats
thank you yeoman
you re welcome sir leaves time on second simulated attack
when find the headquarters genius that assigned me female yeoman
what the matter jim don you trust yourself
ve already got female to worry about her name the enterprise drill repeat this is not drill
kirk here us
coming
exceptionally strong contact not visual yet distant spectrograph metallic similar to cube much greater energy reading
there sir
half speed prepare for evasive action
reducing to warp two sir
tractor beam captain something grabbed us hard
engines overloading sir
all engines stop
all engines stopped sir
phaser crews stand ready
bridge to phaser crews stand ready ready
fascinating
what its mass mister spock
reading goes off my scale captain must be mile in diameter
over five thousand metres away and it still fills the screen
reduce image let me see all of it
magnification two five sir magnification one eight point five sir
ship to ship
hailing frequencies open sir
this is the united earth ship enterprise we convey greetings and await your reply what is it mister bailey
message coming over my navigation beam
pick it up
switching sir commander of the flagship fesarius of the first federation your vessel obviously the product of primitive and savage civilisation having ignored warning buoy and having then destroyed it has demonstrated your intention is not peaceful we are now considering the disposition of your ship and the life aboard
ship to ship
hailing frequencies open sir
this is the captain of the enterprise speaking the warning nature of your space buoy was unknown to us our vessel was blocked when we attempted to disengage
captain we re being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor probes everywhere our electrical systems our engines slightest hostile move your vessel will be destroyed immediately
they re shutting off some of our systems captain brilliant extremely sophisticated in their methods
does the recorder marker have this on its tapes
enough to warn other earth ships
mister bailey dispatch recorder marker mister bailey
recorder marker dispatched sir
marker on course heading back the way we big bang examined your ship must be destroyed we make assumption you have deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you we therefore grant you ten earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations
might be interesting to see what they look like if can locate where that voice is coming from mccoy and scott enter
balok message it was heard all over the ship
captain to crew those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms you know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves an irrational fear of the unknown but there no such thing as the unknown only things temporarily hidden temporarily not understood in most cases we have found that intelligence capable of civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures surely lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives all decks stand by captain out ship to ship
hailing frequencies open sir
this is the captain of the uss enterprise we came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass to demonstrate our goodwill our vessel will now return the way it came we humming noise lay in course ahead mister bailey
what course
plotted and laid in sir
engage warp factor one
warp factor there no response
switch to impulse
all engine systems show dead and weapon systems
switching to screen believe can get something visual escape you have eight earth minutes left
was curious to see how they appeared
yes of course you were
don understand this spock wasting time everybody else just sitting around somebody got to do something
easy bailey
what do they want from us let find out what they want us to do
they want us to lose our heads
we ve only got eight minutes left
seven minutes and forty five seconds
he doing countdown
practically end of watch
what are you all out of your minds end of watch it the end of everything what are you robots wound-up toy soldiers don you know when you re dying watch and regulations and orders what do they mean
bailey you re relieved escort him to his quarters doctor
let go mccoy and bailey leave
ship to ship
hailing frequencies open sir
this is the captain of the enterprise speaking it is the custom of earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible we destroyed your space buoy as simple act of self-preservation when we attempted to move away from it it emitted radiation harmful to our species if you ve examined our ship and its tapes you know this to be true humming noise
four minutes thirty seconds
you have an annoying fascination for timepieces mister sulu
jim
what the matter with them out there they must know we mean them no harm
they re certainly aware by now that we re totally incapable of it
there must be something to do something ve overlooked
in chess when one is outmatched the game is over checkmate
is that your best recommendation
regret that can find no other logical alternative
assuming we get out of this captain
nobody given up yet
well then about bailey let me enter it in my medical records as simple fatigue
that my decision doctor
and your mistake you overworked him pushed him expected too much from him
ordering you to drop it have no time for you your theories your quaint philosophies
intend to challenge your actions in my records ll state that warned you about bailey condition now that no bluff
any time you can bluff me doctor
all right doctor let hope we have time to argue about it not chess mister spock poker do you know the game ship to ship
hailing frequencies open sir
this is the captain of the enterprise our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning one critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any earth ship since the early years of space exploration earth vessels have had incorporated into them substance known as corbomite it is material and device which prevents attack on us if any destructive energy touches our vessel reverse reaction of equal strength is created destroying
destroying the attacker it may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago no attacking vessel has survived the attempt death has little meaning to us if it has none to you then attack us now we grow annoyed at your foolishness
however it was well played regret not having learned more about this balok in some manner he was reminiscent of my father
then may heaven have helped your mother
quite the contrary she considered herself very fortunate earth woman
doc sorry
for having other things on your mind my fault don how the devil you keep from punching me in the face
one minute knew he would bailey enters if anyone interested thirty seconds
request permission to return to post sir
permission granted
eleven ten seconds nine eight seven six five four three two one
very interesting game this poker
it does have advantages over chess
love to teach it to you
here it comes is it raise or call relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite device
hold on that let him sweat for change ship to ship
hailing frequencies sir
request denied
have visual contact captain regarding your vessel and having permitted your primitive efforts to see my form trust it has pleased your curiosity and now another demonstration of our superiority
thought the power was off in the galley
used hand phaser and zap hot coffee
something going on captain something leaves the fesarius
it small ship
about two thousand metric tons the first federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform there you will disembark and be interned your ship will be destroyed of course
engine systems coming on captain an equal potential to destroy your vessel
tractor beam again systems are now open escape is impossible since you are being taken under our power to your destination any move to escape or destroy this ship will result in the instant destruction of the enterprise and everyone aboard
we re being towed sir captain log star date 1514 the enterprise is in tow to this point no resistance has been offered my plan show of resignation balok tractor beam has to be heavy drain of power on his small ship question will he grow careless
captain he pulling out little ahead of us
he sneaked power down bit
our speed is down to point six four of light
want right angled course shear away from him no matter which way he turns
yes sir
maximum acceleration when give the word
yes sir
engage
it strain captain engines are overloading
more power
we re superheating intermix temperature seven thousand four hundred degrees seven five seven six eight thousand degrees everything is juddering the little ship is getting brighter and brighter
shear away mister bailey
two thousand degrees above maximum eight four eight five eight six she ll blow soon
now mister sulu impulse power two
we re breaking free sir
all engines stop
all engines stopped sir
engines need work badly captain can you hold it here few hours
that may not be wise he got signal through to the mother ship
then we re not home yet
signal captain it very weak it balok it distress signal to the fesarius his engines are out his life-sustaining system isn operating the message is repeating sir
any reply
negative sir the signal is growing weak sir doubt if the mother ship could have heard it
plot course for it mister bailey
for it captain
dead ahead this is the captain speaking first federation vessel is in distress we re preparing to board it there are lives at stake by our standards alien life but lives nevertheless captain out
course plotted and laid in sir
mister scott ready the transporter room
aye sir leaves
mister sulu bring us to within one hundred metres ahead slow
ahead slow sir
jim don you think
what the mission of this vessel doctor to seek out and contact alien life and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean any questions ll take two men with me doctor mccoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary and you mister bailey
sir
the face of the unknown think owe you look at it
yes sir
captain request permission to
denied if wrong if it trap want you here
transporter ready
well yes sir but it risky we re locked on what appears to be main deck
air sample
breathable in fact slightly higher oxygen content than our own communicator phaser weapon
thank you scotty ready doctor
no but you won let that stop you
bend low gentlemen it reads pretty cramped over there ready to transport
energise
it dummy puppet of some kind
balok welcome aboard curtain opens to reveal small humanoid with big grin
captain kirk
and mccoy and bailey sit be comfortable go ahead be seated we must drink this is tranya hope you relish it as much as
commander balok
know know thousand questions but first the tranya gentlemen drinks ahh
commander that puppet
my alter ego so to speak in your culture he would be mister hyde to my jekyll you must admit he effective you would never have been frightened by me and thought my distress signal quite clever it was pleasure testing you
testing us
see
had to discover your real intentions
but you probed our memory banks
your records could have been deception on your part
and your crew
have no crew doctor run everything this entire complex from this small ship but miss company conversation even an alien would be welcome perhaps one of your men for some period of time an exchange of information cultures
yes both our cultures would benefit do you know where we can find volunteer mister bailey
me sir like to volunteer
ah you represent earth best then
no sir not ll make plenty of mistakes
but you find out more about us that way and get better officer in return
laughs see we think much alike captain you and now before bring back the fesarius let me show you my vessel it is not often have this pleasure yes we re very much alike captain both proud of our ships captain log stardate 2821 on route to makus three with cargo of medical supplies our course leads us past murasaki 312 quasar-like formation vague undefined priceless opportunity for scientific investigation on board is galactic high commissioner ferris overseeing the deliver of the medicines to makus three
captain to shuttlecraft galileo stand by mister spock
remind you captain entirely opposed to this delay your mission is to get those emergency medical supplies to makus three in time for their transfer to the new paris colonies
no problem commissioner and may remind you that have standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may be encountered besides it three days to makus and the rendezvous doesn take place for five
don like to take chances the plague is out of control on new paris we must get those drugs there on time
no problem captain to galileo all systems cleared for take off the ncc1701/7 is in the hangar bay preparing to launch
power up all instruments activated all readings normal all go
launch shuttlecraft the curved doors at the stern of the engineering deck open and the little vessel heads out into space
readings normal acceleration normal phase one separation normal
position
three point seven sir
make up your mind please mister latimer
sir this indicator gone crazy
that to be expected mister spock quasars are extremely disruptive just how much we don know
considerably mister boma
mister spock radiation is increasing
stop forward momentum mister latimer
can sir nothing happens
galileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise come in please
ionic interference mister spock
we re being drawn right into it
galileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise we are out of control being pulled directly into the heart of murasaki three one two being hit by violent radiation on outer hull course three point two five
anything at all
nothing clear captain just few words about being pulled off course
try and get me fix on the galileo
scanners are blank captain we re getting mass of readings ve never seen nothing makes sense kirk switches on spock science computer
negative ionic concentration one point six four times ten to the ninth power metres radiation wave length three hundred seventy angstroms harmonics upward along entire spectrum
what is it captain
that thing out there has ionized this complete sector none of our instruments work at least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity and out there somewhere twenty four foot shuttlecraft off course out of control finding needle in haystack would be child play captain log stardate 2821 the electromagnetic phenomenon known as murasaki three twelve whirls like some angry blight in space depressive reminder that seven shipmates still have not been heard from equally bad the effect has rendered our normal searching systems useless without them we are blind and almost helpless yeoman is delivering cups of coffee
was opposed to this from the very beginning our flight to makus three is of the very highest priority
aware of that commissioner at the same time have certain scientific duties must perform and investigating the murasaki effect is one
yes but you ve lost your crew
we have two days to find them
two days ln all that two days
what would you have me do turn around and leave them there
you shouldn have sent them out in the first place do you know what you ve done you ve concerned yourself with only seven people
captain there one planet in this solar system capable of sustaining human life it type oxygen nitrogen and it listed as taurus two it unexplored as far as we can determine with our equipment malfunction it just about dead-centre of the murasaki effect
thank you lieutenant mister sulu
yes sir
set course for taurus two
aye aye sir
you said something about needle in haystack it useless
if they re not there commissioner then they re dead by now shuttlecraft galileo appears to have landed in one piece in rocky landscape it contents have been rather shaken about and many are holding their heads
you all right
holding his right wrist yes
scotty boma
now that what call ride
yeoman
yes just got little bump on the head
helping her back into her seat upsy-daisy
thank you
what happened
can be sure but say that the magnetic potential of the effect was mccoy gives him tissue for his nose bleed thank you was such that as we gathered speed it was multiplied geometrically and we were simply shot into the centre of the effect like projectile
say your evaluation is reasonable mister boma
what mess
picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits mister scott think you ll find your work is cut out for you galileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise come in please
you don really expect to get an answer do you
expect nothing mister scott it is merely logical to try all the alternatives doctor mccoy reading on the atmosphere please
partial pressure of oxygen seventy millimetres of mercury nitrogen one forty breathable if you re not running in competition
just the facts doctor
traces of argon neon krypton all in acceptable quantities however wouldn recommend this place as summer resort
thank you for your opinion it will be duly noted you re recording this yeoman
of course mister spock
mister scott if you ll make survey of the damage please
logical
gentlemen think we should move outside make room for mister scott to do his work mister latimer mister gaetano you ll arm yourselves and scout out the area keeping in visual contact with the ship
aye aye sir the two men go outside and the doors close behind them
what do you think our chances are of contacting the enterprise
under present conditions extremely poor
but they ll be looking for us
if the ionisation effect is as widespread as believe it is doctor they ll be searching for us without instrumentation by visual contact only on those terms this is very large planet
then you don think they ll find us
not as long as we re grounded we may be here for very long time doctor enterprise is orbiting sickly green swirled planet and commissioner ferris is lounging by the door watching uhura working
nothing captain
mister sulu
yes captain
anything on your scanners
totally inoperative sir no readings at all
have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power
yes sir no change
transport room this is the captain speaking are the transporters beaming up yet material but it came back in disassociated condition we wouldn dare try with people
thank you this is the captain speaking flight deck prepare columbus for immediate exit for search of the planet surface correlate co-ordinates with mister sulu thank you anything uhura
all wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects sir transmission is blocked reception impossible
well captain
we have until 2823 to continue the search commissioner
you don really think you ll have any luck do you
look these people are my friends and my shipmates intend to continue the ship search for them until the last possible moment
very well captain but not one second beyond that moment is that clear if it isn suggest you look at book nineteen section four thirty three paragraph twelve
familiar with the regulations commissioner know all about your authority launch shuttlecraft columbus spock is scanning one of it small nacelles when mccoy comes out to join him
well can say much for the circumstances but at least it your big chance
my big chance for what doctor
command oh know you mister spock you ve never voiced it but you ve always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command am right
am logical man doctor
it ll take more than logic to get us out of this
perhaps doctor but know of no better way to begin realise command does have its fascinations even under circumstances such as these but neither enjoy the idea of command nor am frightened of it it simply exists and will do whatever logically needs to be done excuse me he heads back inside
very bad mister spock
in what way
we ve lost great deal of fuel we have no chance at all to reach escape velocity and if we ever hope to make orbit we ll have to lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds
the weight of three grown men
aye you could put it that way
or the equivalent weight in equipment
doctor mccoy with very few exceptions we use virtually every piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit there very little excess weight except among the passengers
you mean three of us must stay behind
unless the situation changes radically yes
and who to choose
as commanding officer the choice will be mine
you wouldn be interested in drawing lots
very quaint idea mister boma but do believe better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots
all right mister spock who
my choice will be logical one arrived at through logical means
mister spock life and death are seldom logical
but attaining desired goal always is doctor now gentlemen suggest we move outside to make further examination of the hull in the event we ve overlooked any minor damage spock leaves
if any minor damage was overlooked it was when they put his head together
not his head mister boma his heart his heart latimer and gaetano are investigating strange scraping sound but the mist is obscuring their vision
what is it
ii don know it from up there
no it from back there
it everywhere it all around us
let get out of here they go to the top of the ridge and latimer stands up someone throws large flint-tipped spear into his back and he falls the scream is heard back at the shuttlecraft
come on boma gaetano fires his phaser at several different enemies the spear in latimer back is taller than man
what was it
it was something huge terrible up there think hit it
did you see what it was
vaguely it was like giant ape
poor latimer
at least it was quick for him
we ll get off all right
returns from investigating nothing there
tell you there was
don doubt your word
but there must be something swear hit it
pulling the bloody spear from latimer body and examining it folsom point
sir
there remarkable resemblance to the folsom point discovered in 1925 old world calendar new mexico north america bit more crude about the shaft believe not very efficient
not very efficient is that all you have to say
am in error mister boma
you error impossible
then what mister boma
there man lying there dead and you talk about stone spears what about latimer
my concern for the dead will not bring him back to life mister boma
mister spock in the interest of efficiency don think we should leave his body here
bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts if you need assistance
we ll do it give me hand with latimer will you captain log stardate 2822 we continue to search but find it more difficult each moment to ward off sense of utter futility and great loss
captain the columbus has returned from searching quadrant seven seven nine by five three four results negative
have them proceed to the next quadrant any word from engineering on our sensors
they re working on them sir still inoperable
what about the transporters
they re still reported unsafe
thank you lieutenant
captain
yes commissioner
don relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out there however must remind you
haven forgotten commissioner
you re running out of time
haven forgotten that commissioner this is the captain try using overload power on the transporters we ve got to get them working
uhura order the columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on
but captain two degrees means they ll be overlooking more than dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop
it also means we have fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet surface mind your helm mister sulu
yes sir
stepping into the turbolift twenty four more hours captain
perhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve
it too delicate it may not be able to take the pressure as it is
coming in from rear compartment this should save us at least fifty pounds mister spock
excellent doctor
we should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds
which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight
can believe you re serious about leaving someone behind now whatever it is that out there
it is more rational to sacrifice one life than six doctor
not talking about rationality
you might be wise to start
looking in from outside mister spock we re ready
for what
the services for latimer
mister boma we re working against time
the man dead he deserves decent burial you re the captain few words
doctor perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion
mister spock that your place
my place is here if you please doctor
now look we may all die here at least let us die like men not machines
by dealing with first things first hope to increase our chances of staying alive well mister scott
if you ll give me hand with this conduit boma closes the door and leaves them to it later
pressure dropping we re losing everything
what happened
one of the lines gave the strain of coming through the atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass yes that done it we have no fuel
that would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind consider the alternatives mister scott
we have no fuel what alternatives
mister scott there are always alternatives
mister spock something happening outside they crouch down behind rock while spock stands and listens to that scraping sound
what do those supersensitive ears make of that mister spock
wood rubbing on some kind of leather
they re getting ready they ll attack
not necessarily it could be simple tribal rite assuming tribal culture
not tribal culture their artefacts are too primitive more likely loose association of some sort
if we knew more about them
we know enough if they re tribal they ll have sense of unity we can use that
how mister boma
by hitting them hard give them bloody nose make them think twice about attacking us
yes agree if we stand by and do nothing we re just giving them an invitation to come down and slaughter us
frequently appalled by the low regard you earthmen have for life
well we re practical about it say we hit them before they hit us
mister boma
absolutely
doctor mccoy
seems logical to me
it does indeed it seems logical to me also but to take life indiscriminately
the majority
am not interested in the opinion of the majority mister gaetano components must be weighed our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms friendly or not there third course
that could get us killed
think not doctor mccoy
yes
you and yeoman mears return to the ship assist mister scott in any way possible we ll be back shortly
right mears and mccoy leave
gentlemen you ll follow my orders to the letter firing only when so instructed and at my designated targets
now you re talking
we ll fire to frighten mister gaetano not to kill
oh for the you saw what they did to latimer
am in command mister gaetano the orders and the responsibility will be mine follow me the trio are paddling through dry ice when giant spear is thrown across their path spock fires at one assailant who throws his shield at them too they move on little way
the mists can see them
hear them they re directly ahead of us several believe direct your phasers to two clock and to ten clock
say we hit them dead on
yes know but fortunately giving the orders take aim please and fire when give signal he climbs partway up rock for better view
fire several seconds of sustained phaser beam cease fire it gone quiet they should think twice before bothering us again
still say we should have killed them
it was not necessary fear will do for us what needs to be done mister boma you will return with me to the galileo mister gaetano you remain on guard here keep in contact with the ship boma says silent goodbye to his colleague and the noise starts up again
did you find them
yes we found them they won bother us again
hope not scotty has an idea
it dangerous but it might work
go mister scott
can adjust the main reactor to function with substitute fuel supply
that all very well but we don have substitute supply
aye we do our phasers can adapt them and use their energy it ll take time but it possible
trouble is they happen to be our only defence
they would also seem to be our only hope
aye
after brief thought yeoman your phaser
but what if the creatures attack again
they won attack for at least several hours by then with luck we ll be gone
if can get full load we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands not that we can maintain it long
we don have to maintain it very long mister scott in less than twenty four hours the enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make rendezvous if we can maintain orbit after that time it won make any difference if we burn up in decaying orbit or die here on the planet surface we shall surely die doctor your phaser go to work mister scott
aye aye sir bunch of boxes is beamed aboard
they came back all right sir in my opinion the transporters are now safe for human transport
good this is the captain landing parties one two and three report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet ordinance condition one
captain it big planet it ll be sheer luck if our landing parties find anything
depending on luck lieutenant it almost the only tool we have that ll work gaetano has worked himself up into panic when rock knocks his phaser out of his hand then spear is thrown and finally the giant creature comes for the helpless man spock boma and mccoy arrive on the scene little later and examine the marks in the ground spock picks up the dropped phaser
take this back to mister scott for conversion please doctor
nobody knows what happened to gaetano and you hand over his phaser like nothing happened at all
handing over his own phaser and give this to mister scott in the event don return
just where are you going
have certain scientific curiosity about what become of mister gaetano return to the ship please spock leaves
don know he ll risk his neck locating gaetano and if he finds him he just as liable to order him to stay behind you tell me
do you really think the ship will ever leave
well it won unless we get these phasers back further on spock finds gaetano body draped over rock he picks him up in fireman lift and heads back to the shuttlecraft with him spears are thrown mccoy and boma help him get the body inside scott is still lying in the middle of the floor working
well mister spock they didn stay frightened very long did they
most illogical reaction we demonstrated our superior weapons they should have fled
you mean they should have respected us
of course
mister spock respect is rational process did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally with anger
doctor am not responsible for their unpredictability
they were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling you might as well admit it mister spock your precious logic brought them down on us
why haven they done anything
they re studying us for the moment
another prediction mister spock
my opinion mister boma the shuttlecraft shakes as one of the locals starts battering it with rock
seal the windows
studying us mister spock they seem to learn rather quickly
all right spock you have all the answers what now
mister boma your tone is increasingly hostile
my tone isn the only thing that hostile mister spock
curious most illogical
sick and tired of your logic
we could use little inspiration
strange step by step have made the correct and logical decisions and yet two men have died
and you ve brought our furry friends down on us
do seem to have miscalculated regarding them and inculcated resentment on your parts the sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole mccoy little less analysis and more action that what we need mister spock
how much longer mister scott
another hour maybe two
that won be long enough
doctor phaser can only drain so fast
how long do you think those plates will hold out under this we ve got to do something
you ve got your hands full captain log stardate 2823 our landing parties are on the surface of taurus two we continue to hope instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses on the ship we can only wait helplessly
what word from the sensor section
at last report they were getting some readings
not interested in the last report want to know now
yes sir
you have two hours and forty three minutes captain
perfectly aware of how much time have left
delighted however shall continue to remind you
you do that
sir sensor section reporting static interference still creating false images estimates eighty percent undependable
what about radio communication
clearing slowly still incapable of transmission or reception
what do you intend to do
do intend to continue the search foot by foot inch by inch by candlelight if necessary until the last possible moment and if you keep your nose off my bridge be thankful
sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence captain not sure they ll appreciate the way you address high commissioner
in command here mister ferris
you are captain for another two hours and forty two minutes
mister scott how much power do we have left in the ship batteries
they re in good shape but they won lift us off if that what you re getting at
will they electrify the exterior of this ship
that they will mister spock he dashes to the rear compartment and puts on big rubber gloves
get to the centre of the ship don touch the plates be sure you re insulated stand by are you ready scott
ready mister spock
all right go scott uses spanner or something to short out the battery connections again again it goes quiet and still outside
daren use any more not and be sure of ignition
believe we ve used enough mister scott suggest you continue draining the phasers
aye
it must ve worked
for the moment
for the moment
the moment they discover they re not seriously hurt they ll be back meanwhile please check the aft compartment see if there anything you can unload to lighten the ship
mister gaetano body back there
it will of course have to be left behind
not without burial
wouldn recommend it the creatures won be far away
not without burial mister spock
it would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril
ll take that chance you see mister spock would insist upon decent burial even if your body was back there
mister boma
sick and tired of this machine
that enough
gentlemen all right mister boma you ll have your burial provided the creatures will permit it
captain kirk landing party number two has been beamed back aboard ship they have casualties one dead two injured
going to spock station put lieutenant kelowitz on visual his uniform is dirty and he sounds tired
report creatures checked with astral anthropology and they re order 480g anthropoid similar to life forms discovered on hansen planet but much larger ten twelve feet in height
there are casualties before we even knew they were around lieutenant lmmamura has dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations but he ll make it all right captain the creatures are all over the place if the galileo is down on that planet
thank you lieutenant you better report to sickbay yourself commissioner ferris enters
captain kirk check your chronometer you ll see that it is 2823 your time is up
but they re still out there
so are the plague victims on new paris sorry captain now assume authority granted me under title fifteen galactic emergency procedures and order you to abandon search
the columbus hasn returned yet still have two search parties out
you re procrastinating captain you have your orders recall your search parties and proceed to makus three immediately
lieutenant
yes sir
order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface attempt to contact the columbus
in partial contact with them now sir
then have them return immediately mister sulu prepare to abandon search set course for makus three captain log supplement the search parties have returned to the ship and the columbus is on its way back have been compelled to abandon the search
captain the sensor section says the beams are working again
what about the other systems
no sir too much interference
captain course set for makus three
stand ready mister sulu how long before the columbus comes on board
twenty three minutes sir
twenty three minutes
enterprise this is galileo come in please enterprise nothing sir just ionic interference
that it
how about weight
if we shed every ounce we might be able to achieve orbit
and how long can we hold it
few hours no longer but if we time it right we can cut out of orbit and save enough fuel for controlled re=entry
to land here again not very attractive possibility
we have very few alternatives mister spock
doctor mccoy mister boma when can we lift off scott
maybe eight minutes if the weight right mccoy appears from the aft compartment
gentlemen the ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes you have that long to bury mister gaetano now it appears to be clear outside at least for the moment ll assist you hurry
the columbus is aboard sir the flight hatch is closed transporter room reports last of the landing parties have beamed safely up all systems report secured for warp factors
mister sulu proceed on course for makus three at space normal speed
space normal sir
those are my orders lieutenant uhura order all sensor sections to direct beams aft full function continuous operation until further orders
yes sir from our viewpoint inside we see the three men standing by two mounds of soil when giant spears start landing near them
get into the ship immediate lift off he throws spear back then gets pinned against rock outcrop by thrown boulder
no go back lift off go back no but boma and mccoy ignore his orders and free him
all right all right go go go go they all get safely into the shuttlecraft
go scott
aye aye sir
told you to lift off
don be fool mister spock we couldn leave you out there
get us off scott
we should be moving but we re not
quite right mister scott there somebody holding us down all systems are go but we re not moving throws switches on the pilot panel
what are you doing
our boosters
we ll never be able to hold orbit
would you rather stay here
no mister spock they swap seats
we re moving
they let go
we got off
may remind you we have yet to achieve orbit nor can we maintain it long an hour from now we may be right back where we started from the galileo leaves the sickly yellow and green atmosphere of the planet
gentlemen by coming after me you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival the logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind
mister spock remind me to tell you that sick and tired of your logic
that is most illogical attitude orbit in one minute mister scott fuel status
fifteen pounds psi approximately enough for one orbit sir
after that
tapping our boosters ended our last chance for soft landing
you mean burn-up
it is the usual end of decaying orbit
don want to die up here
infinitely preferable to the kind of death we be granted on the planet surface should think
admire your ability to make so measured choice
mister spock you said while ago that there were always alternatives
did may have been mistaken
well at least lived long enough to hear that is there anything we can do
the enterprise is surely on course for makus three by now for one do not believe in angels
well mister spock so ends your first command
yes my first command
orbit attitude mister spock with our present fuel that gives us about forty five minutes
galileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise come in please galileo to enterprise come in please he ponders for moment then flicks the fuel jettison button
mister spock there jolt as two long plumes of flame streak out from the nacelles
what happened
he jettisoned the fuel and ignited it
we need that fuel to maintain orbit are you out of your mind
perhaps mister boma
how long have we got now scotty
the orbit ll start decaying as soon as the fuel exhausted say six minutes the air is full of pointless status reports over the comm when suddenly
captain there something there on screen at taurus two on the viewscreen long trail of yellow crosses the green of the planet
sensors meteorite
no it holding lateral line there it is again holding steady captain
hundred and eighty degrees about mister sulu lieutenant uhura contact transporter room all beams ready full normal speed
distress signal it like sending up flare mister spock that was good gamble perhaps it was worth it
no one out there to see it the plume of flame fades out
orbit decaying mister spock ten seconds to atmosphere
it may be the last action you ll ever take mister spock but it was all human
totally illogical there was no chance
that exactly what mean the front of the little craft starts to glow red and instrumentation begins to smoke and crackle
it getting hot
transporters locked in sir
activate beams our last view inside galileo is of lots of smoke then transporter beams
whatever it was captain it just burned up in the atmosphere
captain transporter room just beamed up five persons alive and well
mister sulu proceed on course to makus three ahead warp factor one
aye aye sir warp factor one later everyone is back on duty
mister spock
captain
there really something don understand about all of this maybe you can explain it to me logically of course when you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it you knew there was virtually no chance of it being seen yet you did it anyhow that would seem to me to be an act of desperation
quite correct captain
now we all know and sure the doctor will agree with me that desperation is highly emotional state of mind how does your well-known logic explain that
quite simply captain examined the problem from all angles and it was plainly hopeless logic informed me that under the circumstances the only possible action would have to be one of desperation logical decision logically arrived at
see you mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst
well wouldn put it in exactly those terms captain but those are essentially the facts
you re not going to admit that for the first time in your life you committed purely human emotional act
no sir
mister spock you re stubborn man
yes sir captain log stardate 3192 the enterprise is en route to star cluster ngc 321 objective to open diplomatic relations with the civilisations known to be there we have sent message to eminiar seven principal planet of the star cluster informing them of our friendly intentions we are awaiting an answer
nothing yet lieutenant
nothing captain hailing frequencies are open ambassador fox enters the bridge from the turbolift
have you received an answer to your message yet captain
nothing yet ambassador we re awaiting reply today the first time we ve had any evidence they ve picked up our signal
captain message coming in from eminiar seven sir it code seven-ten
are you sure
positive it repeats over and over
is that supposed to mean something
code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet no circumstances what so ever
you will disregard that signal captain
mister fox it is their planet
captain in the past twenty years thousands of lives have been lost in this quadrant lives that could have been saved if the federation had treaty port here we mean to have that port and here to get it
by disregarding code seven-ten you might well involve us in an interplanetary war
quite prepared to take that risk
you are thinking about this ship my crew
have my orders captain and now you have yours you will proceed on course achieve orbit status and just leave the rest to me you re well aware that my mission gives me the power of command now exercise it you will proceed on course that direct order he leaves
in view of code seven-ten captain may suggest
yes mister spock this is the captain condition yellow alert phaser crews stand by deflector shields up we re going in peacefully hope but peacefully or not we re going in captain log stardate 3192 now in standard orbit around planet eminiar seven my orders are clear we must establish diplomatic relations at all cost preparing to beam down to planet surface
we know very little about them their civilisation is advanced they ve had space flight for several centuries but they ve never ventured beyond their own solar system when first contacted more than fifty years ago eminiar seven was at war with its nearest neighbour
anything else
the earth expedition making the report failed to return from its mission the uss valiant listed as missing in space
kirk what this about you going down alone
not alone taking some security people with me
it is my prerogative
can risk beaming you down there until know what kind of reception you re going to receive your safety is my responsibility those are my orders sir mister spock
transporter room standing by captain
what co-ordinates
we ve selected site which from the traffic seems to be near an official establishment
final sensor readings
no hostility directed toward us no apparent notice taken of us at all which seems strange they did scan us when we assumed orbit obviously they know we re here
ship defences
screens down but all defensive details on general alert status captain
good landing party will pick up phaser number one from the arsenal keep them inconspicuous mister scott
yes sir
the ship is yours take care of her until come back
aye aye sir and have bonny trip
we ll do our best let go young woman in black tights and skillfully draped scarf is accompanied by two guards she uses scanning device
they will materialise there remember your instructions; they are to be treated correctly nothing more kirk spock yeoman and two guards materialise next to sculpture
captain james kirk of the starship enterprise representing the united federation of planets
know mea congratulate you on your instrumentation you ve come directly to the division of control if you ll follow me please
captain wish
yes
you were warned not to come here
had orders to come here why did your people tell us to stay away
it was for your own safety captain
see no danger here
the danger exists nevertheless you are here it would be morally incorrect to do less than extend our hospitality anan and members of the high council await you if you will come this way please five stern looking men sit along table facing the door
captain kirk this is my first officer mister spock lieutenants galloway osborne yeoman tamula
welcome to eminiar seven well captain what can we do for you
my mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine
that is impossible
would you mind telling me why
because of the war
you re still at war
we have been at war for five hundred years
you conceal it very well mister spock
sir we have completely scanned your planet we find it highly advanced prosperous in material sense comfortable for your people and peaceful in the extreme yet you say you are at war there is no evidence of this
casualties among our civilian population total from one to three million dead each year from direct enemy attack that is one reason captain why we told you to stay away as long as your ship is orbiting our planet it is in severe danger
with whom are you at war
the third planet in our system called vendikar originally settled by our people and now ruthless enemy highly advanced technologically an alarm sounds
please excuse me vendikar is attacking mea care for our guests the council adjourn into an adjacent room filled with computer equipment
strange
to say the least
it will not last long
don you take shelter
there is no shelter captain
are these attacks frequent
oh yes and we will retaliate immediately she sees an area flare on map
oh
what is it
hit right here in the city
do you hear any explosions mister spock
none captain yeoman tamula
sir
tricorder readings radiation disturbances of any kind she scans the area
working sir no evidence
mea if this is an attack may ask what weapons the enemy is using
fusion bombs materialised by the enemy over their targets
kirk to bridge scotty
scanners operative on the planet surface
anything unusual
thank you kirk out
look anan another flare on another screen
yes see it they were warned
just as it happened fifty years ago
alert security detachment they may be needed anan rejoins the group
it vicious attack extremely destructive fortunately our defences are firming but our casualties are high very high
sir have been in contact with my ship which has had this entire planet under surveillance all during this so-called attack of yours we have been monitoring you there been no attack no explosions no radiations no disturbances whatsoever if this is some sort of game you re playing
this is no game captain half million people have just been killed activate the attack units sar
yes councilman
launch immediate counter attack
computers captain they fight their war with computers totally
yes of course
computer don kill half million people
deaths have been registered of course they have twenty four hours to report
to report
to our disintegration machines you must understand captain we have been at war for five hundred years under ordinary conditions no civilisation could withstand that but we have reached solution
then the attack by vendikar was theoretical
oh no quite real an attack is mathematically launched lost my wife in the last attack our civilisation lives the people die but our culture goes on
you mean to tell me your people just walk into disintegration machine when they re told to
we have high consciousness of duty captain
there is certain scientific logic about it
glad you approve
do not approve understand
good then you will recall warned you not to come here you chose to ignore my warning sorry but it happened
what has happened
once your ship was in orbit about our planet it became legitimate target it has been classified destroyed by tricobalt satellite explosion all persons aboard your ship have twenty four hours to report to our disintegration machines in order to ensure their co-operation have ordered you captain and your party held in custody until they surrender if possible we shall spare your ship captain but its passengers and crew are already dead captain log delayed the enterprise in orbit about eminiar seven has been declared casualty of an incredible war fought by computers and my landing party though apparently not included as casualties aboard the enterprise are confined on the planet surface awaiting what
have been sent to ask if you require anything
we require great deal wish to speak to anan seven
he busy co-ordinating casualty lists
he ll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn get in here and talk to me
don you understand our duty
your duty doesn include stepping into disintegrator and disappearing
afraid mine does captain too have been declared casualty must report to disintegrator by noon tomorrow
is that all it means to you to report and die
my life is as dear to me as yours is to you captain
then how can you stand
don you see if refuse to report and others refuse then vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons we would have to do the same to defend ourselves more than people would die then whole civilisation would be destroyed surely you can see that ours is better way
no don see that at all
it been our way for almost five hundred years is there anything can bring you
yes anan seven
tell you we should have heard something by now
aye doctor that we should but we haven and we cannot raise them you know if there been trouble they should have at least managed to get word back to us
we can just sit here
what would you suggest
me doctor if were an officer of the line
would you have me open fire
of course not
mister scott message coming in from the captain
scott here captain
good news mister scott the eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations
mister fox ll be glad to hear about that
they ve also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore for shore leave they ve assured me that our people will have wonderful time
er captain it sounds like kirk but it isn
yes mister scott
all personnel we ll transport up trained eminians to assume support positions those are my orders mister scott
aye aye captain we ll start forming shore parties immediately scott out well now what do you think of that
don know
well do computer last message received and recorded from captain kirk
in place
run it through analyser question is it or is it not the captain voice
negative close copy
voice duplicator
ninety eight percent probability
well they ve got them doctor and now they re trying to get us
are you sure you can do it mister spock
limited telepathic abilities are inherent in vulcanians captain it may work it may not
do your best spock goes to the door and begins to slowly work his way across it outside the guard starts to blink and shake his head spock reaches the place directly behind the guard and looks as if he is doing mind meld through the wall slowly the guard opens the door and enters he is swiftly disarmed and knocked out
thank you mister spock
my pleasure captain
what do we do now captain
we get our communicators back and try and contact the ship mister spock we ll need more weapons
understand
we ll try to take it easy but if we re forced to kill as holder of the only gun kirk leads the way into the corridors of the city at junction they watch as first young woman then security guard go into booth
an entrance captain but no exit they go in but they do not come out
disintegration machine
so would assume they move forward carefully and meet
mea what do you think you re doing
going
you re not going in there
but must
no you re not
please all right don worry about me
mister spock that guard ll cover you spock walks nonchalantly up to the guard in charge of disintegrating the waiting queue of people
sir there multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder he neck-pinches him as the rest just stare they now have two weapons spock rejoins kirk
all right you people clear out of the way kirk fires at the booth
what are you doing
throwing monkey wrench into the machinery
you can do this
ve done it the booth finally blows up come on let get out of here attacked their guard and escaped they are armed disintegration station number twelve destroyed councilman apparently by disruptor fire
all security personnel federation prisoners have escaped they are to be found they are armed if they resist do what is necessary planetary disruptor banks calculate orbit of star cruiser now circling stand by to fire full power target standing by
in ten seconds open fire destroy the star cruiser those are the orders of the council ship log stardate 3193 chief engineer scott recording the captain and first officer are overdue and missing on the surface of eminiar seven have taken standard precautionary measures while we continue our attempts to locate them
all stations reporting deflector screens rigged at full power phaser crews ready sensors reading zero correction mister scott
yes mister depaul
sensor readings just shot off the scale
well now they re taking pot shots at us holding mister depaul
screens firm sir extremely powerful sonic vibrations decibels eighteen to the twelfth power if those screens weren up we be totally disrupted by now
well guess that answers our questions mister scott they re not very friendly are they
aye but what about our captain and the landing party down there somewhere
we get them out
if they re alive and if we can find them that big planet
not too big for the enterprise to handle if it has to
we can fire full phasers with our screens up and we can lower our screens with their disruptors on us of course could treat them to few dozen photon torpedoes
entering the bridge you ll do no such thing mister scott
mister fox we re under attack they re trying to knock us down
you have taken defensive measures
of course but
there are no buts obviously it misunderstanding and one of my jobs is to clear up misunderstandings
they re holding our captain
we have no proof of that
responsible for the safety of this ship
and responsible for the success of this mission and that more important than this ship is that clear we came here to establish diplomatic relations with these people
but they re the ones who re looking for fight mister fox
this is diplomatic matter if you check your regulations you ll find that my orders get priority ll try to make contact with the planetary officials lieutenant open up channel and keep it open tell them to expect priority one message from me there will be no punitive measures gentlemen those are my orders he leaves the bridge
diplomats the best diplomat know is fully activated phaser bank
why did we come back here captain
the last place they ll look for us is the place we escaped from gives her gun cover the door
captain you ve got to let me go my time is almost up
are you that anxious to die
you don understand
mister spock how did that little raid work out
we captured four of their disrupter-type weapons two complete outfits of male clothing and perhaps most important of all one of their communication devices
will it reach the ship
not at this time its range is restricted in comparison with ours may be able to alter its components but it will take time
work on it we ve got to contact the ship mea want you to give me complete layout of this building complex how do get to the war room
no
now listen to me trying to help you to save your life and the lives of millions like you if you help me maybe can do it if you don you ll die we ll die and the killing will go on or are you that fond of the war
what are you going to do
we re going to try and stop the killing we re trying to help believe me
believe you but
tell me what want to know please
time is running out we have been unable to destroy the earth ship one of our disintegration chambers has been eliminated and we have already fallen far behind in our quota this is grave crisis and am at loss to know how to proceed
the central channel anan the earth ambassador calling with an urgent message
what is the great immorality open honesty or deception which may save our lives put me through to the earth ambassador
channel is open mister ambassador you will be speaking to anan seven head of the high council of the eminian union
mister anan this is robert fox federation of planets
great honour mister ambassador
we have approached you openly and friendly relations between our peoples but now
for some reason you have attacked us and apparently you re holding several special representatives of our federation
mistake mister ambassador we are at war your ship was about to attack us
giving orders that our attack be stopped have my sacred word as an eminian that they are alive and well
thank you thought perhaps it was all mistake
mister scott disruptor beams are no longer hitting us
maintain status mister depaul fox
we will make arrangements to receive you to sar closing the channel the minute their screens are down open fire
yes councilman
reopening the channel apologise deeply for the misunderstanding these are trying times for us you understand
understand mister anan presume that you have our ship captain on hand when beam down
he will be there sir
sure that from this day forward your planet and our federation will attain the deepest friendship look forward to seeing you he gestures to uhura to end transmission
diplomacy gentlemen should be job left to diplomats you will of course immediately resume peaceful status
no sir will not
what did you say
ll not lower the screens not until the captain tells me to
you are taking orders from me you will lower the screens as sign of good faith my authority
know about your authority but the screens stay up
mister fox they faked message from the captain they ve launched an attack against our ship now you want us to trust them openly
want you and expect you to obey my lawful orders
no sir won lower the screens
your refusal to comply with my orders has endangered the entire success of this mission can have you sent to penal colony for this
that you can sir but won lower the screens
your name will figure prominently in my report to the federation central fox leaves the bridge
well scotty now you ve done it
aye the haggis is in the fire for sure but ll not lower my defences on the word of that mealy-mouthed gentleman down below not until know what happened to the captain kirk enters quietly but anan knows he is there without turning around
won you join me in drink captain you ll find our trova most interesting
didn come to drink
assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber number twelve
very efficient weapon not afraid of using it
my first impression was correct you are barbarian
am
don sound so incredulous captain of course you are we all are killer first builder second hunter warrior and let be honest murderer that is our joint heritage is it not
we re less cold-blooded about it than you are
what do you want captain
want to contact my ship where are my communicators
in safe place
you take lot of chances councilman
you re worried about your ship captain trying to save world
if were you think about saving my life
won you have drink captain kirk pours himself slug of trova and as he turns his back anan presses concealed buttons
and then we can discuss our differences
not interested in discussing our differences you don seem to realise the risk you re taking we don make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations we make the real thing councilman could destroy this planet
why do you think don let you talk to your ship
don need the ship for that
you mean all by yourself with disruptor you can destroy this planet
that exactly what mean
had no idea you were so formidable
you seem to think joking where are the communicators
if told you captain would you walk right out and get them
something like that
very well captain they re in the war room go left down the corridor left again they are unguarded kirk gestures anan to leave in front of him and pushes him into the first guard outside the door then kirk tackles the second guard but finally the pair knock him out
is he alive pity man like that would have preferred to die fighting take him to the council room kirk is half-dragged away fox and his aide beam down to exactly the same place as the original landing party
ambassador fox
am robert fox have the honour of addressing anan seven
welcome to eminiar mister ambassador
mister ambassador am truly sorry for what must happen
beg your pardon
you and your party have been declared war casualties you will be taken immediately to one of our casualty stations so that your deaths may be recorded
you mean we are to be killed
that is correct mister ambassador regret it very much but there is nothing can do about it the two security guards are in eminian uniform and look like something out of thunderbirds the puppet show that is
spock to enterprise come in
mister scott it mister spock
scotty here mister spock go ahead
is the ship all right about the captain and you
the captain is overdue we ve suffered no casualties among us this is important under no circumstances shall any one beam down from the enterprise they be killed the moment they arrived
that ties it that popinjay fox went down couple minutes ago
the ambassador
knew it had rotten ring to it
orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders spock out
what are you going to do mister spock
find the ambassador and the captain yeoman tamula you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself knock her down if necessary this is killing situation do what you must to protect yourself clear
yes sir guard is trying to force fox inside when spock and the two guards arrive
what are you doing representative of the united federation of planets special representative
get in line they disarm and disable the eminian guards
spock
please mister fox ladies and gentlemen please move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured
what are you doing mister spock
practicing peculiar variety of diplomacy sir he uses the disrupter to destroy the disintegration chamber
ll take you to place of comparative safety then must find the captain
they have him the guards told us they took him to the council room under heavy guard
by now mister ambassador sure you realise that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here
ve never been soldier mister spock but learn very quickly
very well sir we need all the help we can get
captain surely you can see the position we are in if your people do not report to our disintegration chambers it is violation of an agreement that dates back five hundred years
my people are not responsible for your agreements
you will be responsible for an escalation that will destroy everything millions of people horribly killed complete destruction of our culture here and yes the culture on vendikar disaster disease starvation horrible lingering death pain and anguish
that seems to frighten you
it would frighten any sane man
yes you re quite right
don you understand captain we have done away with all that now you are threatening to bring it down on us again are those five hundred people of yours more important than the hundreds of millions of innocent people on eminiar and vendikar what kind of monster are you
barbarian you said it yourself
had hoped spoken only figuratively
oh no you were quite accurate plan to prove it to you anan: open channel to the enterprise you give me no choice captain we are not bandits but you force us to act as bandits
scotty general order twenty four two hours in two hours
enterprise this is anan seven first councilman of the high council of eminiar ambassador and his party prisoners
unless you immediately start transportation of all personnel aboard your ship to the surface the hostages will be killed you have thirty minutes mean it captain
all that it means is that won be around for the destruction you heard me give general order twenty four that means in two hours the enterprise will destroy eminiar seven
planetary defence system open fire on the enterprise range
you wouldn do this hundreds of millions of people
didn start it councilman but liable to finish it meanwhile spock and his group are moving through the corridors fox aide gets injured in one weapons exchange so they leave him behind
councilman received message from vendikar our time is nearly up our quota is short by several thousand they accuse us of reneging on the treaty
you see it started
you re wrong it hasn begun destroyed guard positions in tunnels eight and ten fail to answer earth party reported seen in corridor 4a
you have less than two hours councilman
what want or don want has nothing to do with it escalation is automatic you can stop it
stop it counting on it
open channel lieutenant this is the commander of the uss enterprise seven have been located identified and fed into our fire-control system in one hour and forty five minutes
the entire inhabited surface of your planet will be destroyed
you have that long to surrender your hostages
what can do somebody please tell me kirk lures guard to him knocks him down gets his weapon and holds off the others
hold it over there you over there move move move everyone goes over against wall while kirk gets second weapon and stands by the council table
now we ll talk spock and fox enter
had assumed you needed help see in error
no need the help in there mister spock spock enters the war room
kirk to enterprise come in scotty
everything secure here maintain position if everything goes according to plan you can beam us up in ten minutes if you don hear from us carry out general order twenty four on schedule
cross your fingers kirk out death destruction disease horror that what war is all about anan that what makes it thing to be avoided you ve made it neat and painless so neat and painless you ve had no reason to stop it and you ve had it for five hundred years since it seems to be the only way can save my crew and my ship going to end it for you one way or another mister ambassador
yes captain
would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and holding them there
gentlemen if you please
to sar you come with me mister osborne
our communicators weapons sar opens cupboard and osborne gets them
all right mister spock spock: these are the attack computers captain that one defence that one computes the casualties they re all tied in with subspace transmission unit which keeps them in constant contact with their vendikan counterparts
yes go on
at the moment contact is broken it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties
what are you going to do
this one the key the circuit is now locked destroy this one and they ll all go
good get him out of here
now wait minute please please kirk uses his phaser to destroy the computer
let go
against the wall there is very satisfying series of explosions
you realise what you have done
yes do ve given you back the horrors of war the vendikans now assume that you ve broken your agreement and that you re preparing to wage real war with real weapons they ll want do the same only the next attack they launch will do lot more than count up numbers in computer they ll destroy cities devastate your planet you of course will want to retaliate if were you start making bombs yes councilman you have real war on your hands you can either wage it with real weapons or you might consider an alternative put an end to it make peace
there can be no peace don you see we ve admitted it to ourselves we re killer species it instinctive it the same with you your general order twenty four
all right it instinctive but the instinct can be fought we re human beings with the blood of million savage years on our hands but we can stop it we can admit that we re killers but we re not going to kill today that all it takes knowing that we won kill today contact vendikar think you ll find that they re just as terrified appalled horrified as you are that they ll do anything to avoid the alternative ve given you peace or utter destruction it up to you
as third party interested only in peace and the establishment of normal relations should be glad to offer my services as negotiator between you and vendikar ve had some small experiences in such matters
there may be chance we have direct channel with vendikar high council it hasn been used in centuries
then it long overdue shall we go anan and fox leave
there chance it may work captain
kirk to enterprise scotty
cancel implementation of general order twenty four alert transporter room we re ready to beam up
lay in course for argona two navigator mister scott
space details set captain
message from eminiar seven captain ambassador fox reports negotiations underway with vendikar outlook hopeful
good
captain you took big chance
did mister spock they ve been killing three million people year it had been going on for five hundred years an actual attack wouldn have killed any more people than one of their computer attacks but it would have ended their ability to make war the fighting would have been over permanently
but you didn know that it would work
no it was calculated risk still the eminians keep very orderly society and actual war is very messy business very very messy business had feeling that they would do anything to avoid it even talk peace
feeling is not much to go on
sometimes feeling mister spock is all we humans have to go on
captain you almost make me believe in luck
why mister spock you almost make me believe in miracles
the ceremony will be carried on all viewing screens sir
good
there was call for you from the bridge
kirk here now number three gone silent
maintain course to outpost four keep me informed kirk out at the door young lady in gold uniform and pretty head-dress takes scott arm and is escorted into the room to the strains of here comes the bride kirk goes to the rostrum
since the days of the first wooden vessels all shipmasters have had one happy privilege that of uniting two people in the bonds of matrimony we are gathered here today with you angela martine and you robert tomlinson in the sight of your fellows in accordance with our laws and our many beliefs so that you may pledge your bridge all decks alert
kirk here vessel identity unknown
full ahead all decks condition red condition red captain log stardate 1709 patrolling outposts guarding the neutral zone between planets romulus and remus and the rest of the galaxy received emergency call from outpost the enterprise is moving to investigate and assist message terminates
verified captain
our speed is now maximum sir
position eight minutes from outpost four at this velocity sir
scotty
ve talked to my engine room sir we ll get more speed out of her
did outpost give anything at all on the attacking vessel lieutenant
no identification sir
there can be much doubt who attacking sir
mister spock put this star sector on our screen now show our position signal this to all decks lieutenant
all decks standing by sir next action we can risk neither miscalculation nor error
by any man aboard listen carefully science officer
referring to the map on your screens you will note beyond the moving position of our vessel line of earth outpost stations constructed on asteroids they monitor the neutral zone established by treaty after the earth-romulan conflict century ago this conflict was fought atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels
which allowed no quarter no captives nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication therefore no human romulan or ally has ever seen the other earth believes the romulans to be warlike cruel treacherous and only the romulans know what they think of earth the treaty set by sub-space radio established this neutral zone entry into which by either side would constitute an act of war the treaty has been unbroken since that time captain
what you do not know and must be told is that my command orders on this subject are precise and inviolable no act no provocation violate the zone we may defend ourselves war
both these outposts and this vessel will be considered expendable captain out
we know outpost four has been attacked sir so if we intercept romulans now
after whole century what will romulan ship look like mister stiles doubt they ll radio and identify themselves
you ll know sir they re painted like giant bird-of-prey
had no idea that history was your specialty
family history there was captain stiles was in the space service then two commanders and several junior officers all lost in that war sir
their war mister stiles not yours don forget it
yes sir
outpost two coming into sensor range captain
outpost was the first to go silent lieutenant
yes captain then outpost three an hour later
sweeping the area of outpost two sensor reading indefinite double-checking outpost three read dust and debris both earth outposts gone and the asteroids they were constructed on pulverised
open channel to our nearest command base quarter hour reports on our position and status
yes sir
call battle stations mister sulu
battle stations all hands to battle stations battle stations battle stations all decks acknowledge all decks acknowledge sir all stations show green
energise main phasers mister styles all weapons to full power
all weapons to full power phaser control room
the bride phaser control acknowledging all weapons energising to full
the groom happy wedding day almost
you won get off my hook this easily going to marry you mister battle or phaser weapons notwithstanding
well meanwhile temporarily at least am still your superior officer so get with it mister
port weapons show ready
starboard and midship weapons show ready
acknowledge all weapons batteries ready
outpost four now five minutes away sir
and showing on my sensors captain at least it still there
sir regaining contact with outpost four switching to speakers commander hansen
kirk here we re minutes away hansen what your status completely destroyed even though we were alerted had our deflector shield on maximum hit by enormous power first attack blew our deflector shield if they hit us again with our deflector shield gone do you read me enterprise
confirm what hit you hansen what vessel identity
can you locate the intruder for us on my screen now switching to visual
tie us in
tied in sir the viewscreen shows man in wrecked room surrounded by fires here we re mile deep on an asteroid almost solid iron and even through our deflectors it did this can you see
affirmative you re visual hansen what do you have on the intruder only glimpse of it then they fired something at us some form of high-energy plasma fantastic power and then the whole vessel disappeared but it out there somewhere our sensors show that much enterprise something coming on our viewing screen coming at us fast
lock us onto your screen see it it becoming visible in the centre of my screen ship appears from nowhere on the screen
do you have phaser capacity we re still out of range
negative phasers gone weapons crew dead
make challenge warn that ship off
trying to sir they don acknowledge the alien ship fires big red plasma ball and the viewscreen switches to hansen as the outpost is hit then just bright light back to the attacking ship which then vanishes
outpost four disintegrated captain
position of the intruder mister spock
disappeared interesting how they became visible for just moment
when they opened fire perhaps necessary when they use their
have blip on the motion sensor could be the intruder
go to full magnification
screen is on full mag sir
don see anything can understand it
invisibility is theoretically possible captain with selective bending of light but the power cost is enormous they may have solved that problem
continuing to challenge sir still no response
discontinue contact remaining outposts have them signal us any sightings or sensor readings in their area
yes sir
blip has changed its heading and in very leisurely manoeuvre they may not be aware of us
their invisibility screen may work both ways with that kind of power consumption they may not be able to see us
his heading is now one eleven mark fourteen the exact heading romulan would take jim for the neutral zone and home
parallel course
don you mean interception course sir
negative you and mister sulu will match its course and speed with the object on our sensors exactly move for move if he has sensors want him to think we re reflection an echo under no circumstances are you to cross into the neutral zone without my direct orders
acknowledged sir
cancel battle stations all decks standby alert
cancel battle stations
captain may respectfully remind the captain what has happened the romulans have crossed the neutral zone attacked our outposts killed our men
mister stiles
add to that the fact it was sneak attack
mister stiles are you questioning my orders
negative sir pointing our that we could have romulan spies aboard this ship
agree sir respectfully recommend all decks maintain security alert
very well all decks security alert
security alert sir
picking up communication it from their ship
pipe it in
sounds like code sir
have fix on it captain believe can lock on it get picture of their bridge
put it on the screen up shimmers an image of group of four humanoids around console one leaves his post and salutes the figure with his back to us that figure then turns and we see someone who looks just like vulcan both spock eyebrows hit the ceiling there long silence and lot of stares
decoding
cryptography is working on it sir
give it to spock
didn quite get that mister stiles
nothing sir
repeat it
was suggesting that mister spock could probably translate it for you sir
assume you re complimenting mister spock on his ability to decode
not sure sir
well here one thing you can be sure of mister leave any bigotry in your quarters there no room for it on the bridge do make myself clear
you do sir
transmission has been cut off to spock made tape of it sir
very well runs the tape through his computer
something visual ahead captain at extreme range he changing course sir
stay with him helm
turning sir we re given lovely shot of the bird painted on it belly
we grow visible attend the cloaking system
it consumes much power commander with no enemy to concern us
that earth outpost called to an earth vessel now it follows us
which neither retreats nor grows nearer it turns as we turn commander it is our judgment we run from reflection
perhaps so but my judgment prevails
cloaking system on sir
it is good we approach the neutral zone not too soon for me to see the stars of home know they are following
an older man if an earth ship why does he not attack
first study the enemy seek weakness if were their commander that is what would do
my commander sent for decius
message was dispatched you ve broken the rule of silence
only in code commander to inform our praetor of this glorious mission
your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission you re reduced two steps in rank return to post
take care commander he has friends and friends of his kind mean power and power is danger
danger and are old companions
we ve seen hundred campaigns together and still do not understand you
think you do no need to tell you what happens when we reach home with proof of the earthmen weakness and we will have proof the earth commander will follow he must when he attacks we will destroy him our gift to the homeland another war
if we are the strong isn this the signal for war
must it always be so how many comrades have we lost in this way
our portion commander is obedience
obedience duty death and more death soon even enough for the praetor taste centurion find myself wishing for destruction before we can return worry not like you am too well-trained in my duty to permit it continue evasive manoeuvres now back to the first course
they re turning sir we re staying with them
steady on one eleven mark fourteen back on their original course captain toward the neutral zone
what our position navigator
we ll enter the neutral zone in less than an hour sir assuming of course that we don turn back
bring it to the briefing room are you ready gentlemen
from the outpost protective shield cast rodinium this is the hardest substance known to our science he crushes it with his hand
lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion
comments
obviously their weaponry is superior to ours and they have practical invisibility screen
you re discussing tactics do you realise what this really comes down to millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel does
or on what this vessel fails to do doctor
yes well gentlemen the question still remains can we engage them with reasonable possibility of victory
no question their power is simple impulse
meaning we can outrun them
to be used in chasing them or retreating sir
go ahead mister styles called this session for opinions
we have to attack immediately
explain
they re still on our side of the neutral zone there would be no doubt they broke the treaty
attack without visible target how do we aim our phasers
aim with sensors not accurate but if we blanket them
and hope for lucky shot before they zero in on us
and if we don once back they ll report that we saw their weapons and ran
and if they could report they destroyed us
these are romulans you run away from them and you guarantee war they ll be back not just one ship but with everything they ve got you know that mister science officer you ve the expert on these people always left out that one point why very interested in why
sit down mister
agree attack
are you suggesting we fight to prevent fight
based on what memories of war over century ago on theories about people we ve never even met face to face
we know what they look like
yes indeed we do mister stiles and if romulans are an offshoot of my vulcan blood and think this likely then attack becomes even more imperative
war is never imperative mister spock
it is for them doctor vulcan like earth had its aggressive colonising period savage even by earth standards and if romulans retain this martial philosophy then weakness is something we dare not show
do you want galactic war on your conscience
captain to bridge
what our position one minutes
are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports
and at this distance first message
thank you lieutenant check our course ahead mister spock
comet magnitude seven dead ahead and the intruder changing course toward it
comet icarus four composition
quite ordinary an ionised mass trail of frozen vapour particles
and when an object passes through it even an invisible object
it leaves visible trail
our chance gentlemen prepare to attack all hands battle stations hope we won need your services bones
amen to that we re taking big gamble jim
battle status
all stations manned captain
phaser weapons energised set for proximity blast
intruder now bearing directly for comet tail
plot his exact point of entry mister stiles
computed on the board sir
the moment he begins entering the comet tail he becomes visible end run gentlemen we ll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment
acknowledged captain
he maintaining that bearing captain
let get him mister sulu
how pleasing to the eye it is behold marvel in the darkness
you spoke of entrapment
its many particles will obscure their sensing device centurion
we enter it commander
once fully obscured we will turn suddenly back upon our adversary
at last the screen is clear commander
clear
our reflection no longer follows us
escape manoeuvre one quickly
we re losing sensor contact captain
steady as she goes phaser crews ready
phaser crew signal ready sir
he ll only be visible for moment stand by
sir nothing in
at the last moment he must have guessed our move hard to starboard helm
hard to starboard
he did exactly what would have done won underestimate him
traverse pattern all phasers fire
phaser one fire
phaser one fire pulse phaser shots go into the darkness rocking the romulan ship
phaser two fire
phaser two fire the centurion pushes his commander out of the way of falling beam
divert all power to weapons
phaser overload control circuit burnout spock goes under his station to put out the flames
it ll take time to correct sir
captain are they surrendering the romulan ship has become visible
full astern emergency warp speed red plasma blast is heading towards them
do we have emergency warp
full power sir it still overtaking us if we can get one phaser working sir one shot might detonate it
navigation
estimate it ll overtake us in two minutes sir
phasers mister spock
impossible captain
feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately
captain should continue log entry
yeoman affirmative continue log entries
yes sir
ten seconds to impact captain it dissipating sir
it must have range limit rand stands as close as humanly possible to kirk
five four three two one impact everyone gets thrown about bit
limited range
phasers operational captain intruder bearing one eleven mark fourteen
back to his old course
he may think we re destroyed captain
wouldn make that assumption don think their captain will either
intruder holding steady course one eleven mark fourteen
same as before mister sulu stay with him the commander tends to his injured friend
commander the reflection returns
activate our cloak
commander our fuel runs low
quickly
the earth vessel impossible
it moves as we move
its commander is not one to repeat mistake
we ll enter the neutral zone in one minute captain
do we violate the treaty captain
they did doctor
once inside they can claim we did set-up they want war we furnish the provocation
we re still on our side captain
let get them while we are before we enter the neutral zone full ahead mister sulu maximum warp
ahead sir maximum
phasers stand by
sir at this distance
we know their achilles heel mister stiles their weapon takes all their energy they must become visible in order to launch it
phaser hit at this distance would be the wildest stroke of luck
aware of that mister stiles are phasers ready
phasers show ready sir
commander
evasive action the earth ship again they are hit by phaser fire again
twenty seconds to neutral zone sir
lieutenant uhura inform command base in my opinion no option on my responsibility we are proceeding into the neutral zone steady as we go mister sulu continue firing
commander they stay within range will tend to the centurion
no need the centurion is dead
why don we fire commander
no no he shrewd this starship commander he tries to make us waste energy he has estimated we have only enough it is time all debris into disposal tubes
yes commander
the body of the centurion too forgive me my old friend but must use all my experience now to get home
motion sensor signal stopped
cease fire
debris scatter ahead sir we ve hit him
vessel wreckage metal moulds conduit plastoform and body captain however
however
insufficient mass sir
what
simple debris not vessel trick
go to sensor probes
nothing sir no motion out there at all we ve lost them captain captain log stardate 1709 we are at the neutral zone have lost contact with the intruder no reaction on our motion sensors but believe the romulan vessel to be somewhere close by with all engines and systems shut down the enterprise is also playing the silent waiting game in hope of regaining contact the lights are being dimmed and systems shut down as they rig for silent running
captain must make further repairs on the transfer coil it giving out again
all right mister spock work quietly
now twenty full cycles commander still no sign say he been fooled he must have gone on
shh he is there somewhere feel it captain log supplemental now motionless for nine hours forty seven minutes yeoman rand walks in without knocking to find the captain lying on his bed
can get you something from the galley sir coffee at least
thank you yeoman bring it to the bridge ll be there in moment
yes sir mccoy walks in unannounced and rand leaves
wish were on long sea voyage somewhere not too much deck tennis no frantic dancing and no responsibility why me look around that bridge and see the men waiting for me to make the next move and bones what if wrong
captain
no don really expect an answer
but ve got one something seldom say to customer jim in this galaxy there mathematical probability of three million earth-type planets and in all of the universe three million million galaxies like this and in all of that and perhaps more only one of each of us don destroy the one named kirk spock carefully closes the cover on his repairs and is reaching up to his station to help himself up when he accidentally touches button turning on system
what
it all right it all right
signal commander
we have him move toward him
power on reverse course he ll try to slip under us
lateral power sir
coming around sir
phasers fire
phasers fire they are taking damage
how commander how
he sorcerer that one he reads the thoughts in my brain our fuel supply all but gone and he stays out of reach
we are beaten can it be true the praetor finest and proudest flagship beaten
perhaps we can yet save your praetor pride for him more debris into the tubes decius do we have the old-style nuclear warheads aboard
yes commander but only for self-destruction
place one with the debris proximity fuse
yes commander at once
more wreckage sir scattering across our path
cease fire
debris on our scanners
analysis quickly
same type as before sir except one metal-cased object
helm hard over phasers fire point-blank
phasers fire there big explosion everyone gets thrown across the bridge enterprise hangs crooked and motionless in space
glorious glorious
now we go home
they re at our mercy commander remind you of your duty
captain to sickbay
casualties ship outer areas could have been much much worse captain
thank you doctor the lights come back on report mister spock
nuclear device of some kind sir our phasers detonated it less than one hundred metres away
ship damage
mainly overloads and circuit burnouts
weapons status
fully operable scotty standby crew available
sir my first assignment was in weapons control
go lieutenant uhura take over navigation
yes captain
we have engine power now captain if you like to move off and make repairs
maybe we can pull them back to our side of the neutral zone hold our position play dead
still no sign of movement commander
we ve damaged ourselves our fuel reserve is gone
and it is our duty to crush the praetor enemies
do not trust their captain
we are in the neutral zone they will not enter if you refuse permit me the glory of the kill commander
we will attack but on my order
damage reports mister stiles
negative
will you require assistance here
this time we ll handle things without your help vulcan spock leaves then stiles notices purple gas escaping from seal
tomlinson
enemy vessel becoming visible sir
forward phasers stand by the romulan becomes clear image fire fire stiles can you hear me fire spock is walking slowly when he hears the captain commands over the intercom spock turns and runs back to phaser control the room is full of purple smoke
stiles can you hear me fire stiles spock enters just as stiles tries and fails to reach the firing button he activates the controls and the phaser pulses hit the romulan ship
mister sulu prepare to move in on the romulan vessel ship-to-ship uhura put this on the screen
still at the navigation station hailing frequencies open sir the viewscreen shows wrecked room and just the commander still on his feet
captain standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship prepare to abandon your vessel we meet in this way you and are of kind in different reality could have called you friend
what purpose will it serve to die lived my life by it just one more duty to perform he goes to the control console turns switch and the whole ship explodes
are you all right mister spock
yes very well thank you captain
and you stiles
alive sir but wouldn be mister spock pulled me out of the phaser room he saved my life he risked his life after
saved trained navigator so he could return to duty am capable of no other feelings in such matters
how many men did we lose bones
only one tomlinson the boy who was getting married this morning his fiancÃ©e is at the chapel kirk turns to go and rand enters
we finally received an answer from command base sir they say they ll support whatever decision you have to make kirk leaves angela is kneeling in front of the altarpiece crying when kirk enters she gets up and hugs him
it never makes any sense we both have to know that there was reason
all right captain log stardate 2947 we have been through severe ion storm one crewman is dead ship damage is considerable have ordered non-scheduled layover on starbase eleven for repairs full report of damages was made to the commanding officer of starbase eleven commodore stone kirk is not in his usual gold shirt but green one with gold braiding
maintenance section eighteen the section is working on the intrepid reschedule the enterprise is on priority one that makes three times you ve read it jim is there an error
no but the death of the crewman
regulations captain and the extract from your ship computer log confirming this sworn deposition
kirk to enterprise
where mister spock with that computer log extract
he should have been there ten minutes ago sir
kirk out
it great pity the service can afford to lose men like lieutenant commander finney
agree waited until the last possible moment we were on red alert the storm got worse had to jettison the pod the two man transporter alcove in the corner activates
what took you so long mister spock
captain believe
ll take that as he puts the data card into his computer the door opens and teenage girl dressed in blue enters
jamie
there you are just wanted one more look at you the man who killed my father
that not so he was my friend
your friend you hated him all your life that why you killed him you murderer you murderer you murderer she dissolves into tears
mister spock would you please
miss finney come with me please they leave
captain kirk you say you jettisoned the pod after the red alert
you have my sworn deposition
then captain must presume you ve committed willful perjury this extract from your computer log says you jettisoned the pod before going to red alert consider yourself confined to the base official inquiry will determine whether general court martial is in order captain log stardate 2948 starship enterprise remains in orbit around starbase eleven full repairs in progress ve been ordered to stand by on starbase eleven until the inquiry into the death of lieutenant commander finney can be conducted confident of the outcome kirk and mccoy enter and go to the bar
timothy haven seen you since the vulcanian expedition no reply well see our graduating class from the academy is well represented corrigan teller how you doing mike
an older man in gold shirt ll get by jim
dark hair red shirt understand you re laying over for repairs big job
couple of days
you moving out then
in hurry to see me go
oh just wondered how long it take to get new records officer
you can talk plainer than that
can but think the point been made ben was friend of ours
come on jim let go
go on finish ben was friend of yours and
jim
go on waiting to hear the rest
why don you tell us
what would be the point you ve already made up your minds excuse me bones leaves just as lady in floaty green dress enters
if you have any doubt that was indeed captain james kirk of the enterprise
yes know are you friend of his
in these trying times one of the few doctor leonard mccoy and you
areel shaw and friend too an old one
all of my old friends look like doctors all of his look like you well you might as well join me for drink with this inquiry coming up he going to need all the friends he can get
recording inquiry matter captain kirk james subject circumstances of death lieutenant commander finney benjamin
this inquiry to determine whether general court-martial should be convened against captain kirk on charges of perjury and culpable negligence
ready
let us begin with your relationship with commander finney you knew him for long time didn you
yes he was an instructor at the academy when was midshipman but that didn stand in the way of our beginning close friendship his daughter jamie who was here last night was named after me
it common knowledge that something happened to your friendship
it no secret we were assigned to the same ship some years later relieved him on watch once and found circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should ve been closed another five minutes it could have blown up the ship
ship nomenclature specify
united starship republic number 1371
continue
closed the switch and logged the incident he drew reprimand and was sent to the bottom of the promotion list
and he blamed you for that
yes he had been at the academy for an unusually long time as an instructor as result he was late in being assigned to starship the delay he felt looked bad on his record my action he believed made things worse
comment service record of lieutenant commander finney to be appended this inquiry
noted
now let get into the specifics of the storm captain
weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead sent finney into the pod
why finney
his name was at the top of the duty roster
if he blamed you
he may have blamed me that he never rose to command ship but don assign jobs on the basis of who blames me it was finney turn and assigned him he had just checked in with me from the pod when we hit the leading edge of the storm not too bad at first signalled yellow alert then we began encountering pressure variant stress force seven the works finally signaled red alert finney knew he had matter of seconds gave him those seconds and more but apparently it wasn enough
then why captain does the computer log from your ship made automatically at the time indicate that you were still on yellow alert when you jettisoned and not on red
don know there been mistake
it would seem so could the computer be wrong
mister spock is running survey right now but the odds are next to impossible
stop recording now look jim not one man in million could do what you and have done command starship hundred decisions day hundreds of lives staked on you making every one of them right you re played out jim exhausted
is that the way you see it
that the way my report ll read if you co-operate
physical breakdown possibly even mental collapse
possibly
be admitting man died because
admit nothing say nothing let me bury the matter here and now no starship captain has ever stood trial before and don want you to be the first
but if what you suspect is true then guilty should be punished
thinking of the service won have it smeared
by what commodore stone
all right by an evident perjurer who either covering his bad judgment his cowardice or
that as far as you go sir telling you was there on the bridge know what happened know what did
it in the transcript and computer transcripts don lie telling you captain either you accept permanent ground assignment or the whole disciplinary weight of starfleet command is going to light right on your neck
so that the way we do it now sweep it under the rug and me along with it not on your life intend to fight
then you draw general court
draw it demand it and right now commodore stone right now captain log stardate 2948 the officers who will comprise my court-martial board are proceeding to starbase eleven meanwhile repairs on the enterprise are almost complete kirk goes to the table of the lady in green and kisses her hands
areel doctor mccoy said you were here should have felt it in the air like static electricity
flattery will get you everywhere kirk; it been how long has it been
four years seven months and an odd number of days not that counting
you look marvellous you haven changed bit
but things have changed for you haven they
oh you ve heard about that have you
lawyer in the judge advocate office remember
remember let forget it we have lot of lost time to make up for
you re taking it very lightly
the confidence of an innocent man
are you that not what the rumours indicate
look let not talk shop
jim this could ruin you will you take some advice
never could talk you into anything all right fire away
the prosecution will build its case on the basis of kirk versus the computer now if your attorney tries to defend on that basis you won have chance
what other choice is there
that up to your attorney and that why he got to be good one
you perhaps
no busy
well girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once
jim be serious you re not an ordinary human you re starship captain and you ve stepped into scandal if there any way they can do it they ll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the service
you still haven made any recommendation
samuel cogley attorney at law if anyone can save you he can he ll be paying you visit jim ve got to go
areel you still haven told me how you know so much about what the prosecution going to do
because jim kirk my dear old love am the prosecution and have to do my very best to have you slapped down hard broken out of the service in disgrace kirk is about to pour himself drink
you kirk
yes notices the piles of books everywhere what is all this
figure we ll be spending some time together so moved in
hope not crowding you
what the matter don you like books
oh like them fine but computer takes less space
computer huh got one of these in my office contains all the precedents the synthesis of all the great legal decisions written throughout time never use it
why not
ve got my own system books young man books thousands of them if time wasn so important show you something my library thousands of books
and what would be the point
this is where the law is not in that homogenised pasteurised synthesiser do you want to know the law the ancient concepts in their own language learn the intent of the men who wrote them from moses to the tribunal of alpha books
you have to be either an obsessive crackpot who escaped from his keeper or samuel cogley attorney at law
right on both counts need lawyer
afraid so there are four officers in dress uniform on the bench including stone
this court is now in session have appointed as members of this court space command representative lindstrom starship captains krasnovsky and chandra captain kirk direct your attention to the fact that you have right to ask for substitute officers if you feel that any of these named harbour any prejudiced attitudes to your case
have no objections sir
do you consent to the service lieutenant shaw as prosecuting officer and to myself as president of the court
do sir
all right clerk
charge culpable negligence specification in that on stardate 2945 by such negligence captain kirk james did cause loss of life to wit the life of records officer lieutenant commander finney benjamin to all recorded charges and specifications what is the plea
not guilty
proceed lieutenant
call mister spock spock hands over his data chip sits down and puts his hand on the lie detector
spock serial number s179-276sp service rank lieutenant commander position first officer science officer current assignment uss enterprise commendations vulcanian scientific legion of honour awards of valour twice decorated by starfleet command
mister spock as first officer you know great deal about computers don you
know all about them
it is possible for computer to malfunction is it not
affirmative
do you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in the enterprise computer
negative
that answer is based on your mechanical survey of the enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial is it not
affirmative
now the stardate
but the computer is inaccurate never the less
why do you say that
it reports that the jettison button was pressed before the red alert
in other words it reports that captain kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist
and that is impossible
is it were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button
no was occupied the ship was already on yellow alert
then how can you dispute the finding of the log
do not dispute it merely state that it is wrong
oh on what do you base that statement
know the captain he is in
please instruct the witness not to speculate
lieutenant am half vulcanian vulcanians do not speculate speak from pure logic if let go of hammer on planet that has positive gravity need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen
do not see what that has to
gentlemen human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do it is impossible for captain kirk to act out of panic or malice it is not his nature
in your opinion
yes in my opinion
thank you your witness mister cogley
no questions
you may step down
now call the personnel officer for the enterprise
service rank ensign position personnel officer current assignment uss enterprise
in the course of your duties as personnel officer of the enterprise you would be familiar with the service records of all aboard
young asian woman yes ma am
with reference to records officer finney was there in his service record reported disciplinary action for failure to close circuit
yes ma am
was the charge in that instance based upon log entry by the officer who relieved him
yes ma am
and who was that officer
ensign james kirk
louder please for the court
ensign james kirk
now the captain kirk who sits in this courtroom
yes ma am
thank you do you wish to cross-examine mister cogley
no questions
you may step down
now call doctor mccoy to the stand
service rank lieutenant commander position ship surgeon current assignment uss enterprise commendations legion of honour awards of valour decorated by starfleet surgeons
doctor you are on the record an expert in psychology especially space psychology patterns which develop in the close quarters of ship during long voyages in deep space
know something about it
you have just heard the testimony of your own personnel officer that it was an action of the then ensign kirk which placed an unerasable blot on the record of the then lieutenant finney psychologically doctor is it possible that lieutenant finney blamed kirk for the incident
it possible
he could have hated kirk down through the years blamed him for being passed over for promotion blamed him for never being given command of his own correct
he could have
now let us hypothesise doctor is it normal for person to return affection for hatred
no
do we not tend to at first resent and then actively dislike the person who hates us
wait minute don quite follow you
hypothetically would not captain smith begin to hate lieutenant commander jones once he learned that lieutenant commander jones hated and detested him
well yes suppose it could happen
then ask you is it not possible that captain kirk became aware of lieutenant commander finney hatred toward him and perhaps even involuntarily began to reciprocate
not captain kirk
any normal human doctor is it possible
but he not that kind of man
is it theoretically possible doctor
yes it possible
thank you your witness mister cogley
no questions
you may step down mister cogley you ve listened to testimony from three witnesses and in neither instance have you availed yourself of your right to cross-examine have you abrogated that right
well sir the truth is ve been holding back till we get this preliminary business out of the way like to call captain kirk to the stand

may it please the court

wouldn want to slow the wheels of progress but then on the other hand wouldn want those wheels to run over my client in their unbridled haste
continue
awards of valour medal of honour silver palm with cluster starfleet citation for conspicuous gallantry karagite order of heroism
stop think that enough wouldn want to slow things up too much
thank you
now captain despite what these machines indicate was there indeed red alert before you jettisoned the pod
yes sir there was
please tell us about it
firstly am at loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log we were in an ion storm everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved was in command the decisions were mine no one else charges of malice have been raised there was no malice lieutenant commander finney was member of my crew and that exactly the way he was treated it has been suggested that panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely that is not so you ve heard some of the details of my record this was not my first crisis it was one of many during it did what my experience and training required me to do took the proper steps in the proper order did exactly what had to be done exactly when it should have been done
you did the right thing but would you do it again
given the same circumstances would do the same thing without hesitation because the steps took in the order took them were absolutely necessary if were to save my ship and nothing is more important than my ship
your witness miss shaw
the prosecution does not wish to dishonour this man but facts are facts must invite the attention of the court and captain kirk to this visual extract from the enterprise computer log play back what you are about to see is precisely what took place on the enterprise bridge during the ion storm on the courtroom viewscreen
meteorology reports ion storm upcoming captain
we ll need somebody in the pod for readings
mister finney is top of duty roster captain
post him
attention commander finney report to pod for reading on ion plates
officer posted captain the ship suddenly judders
stand by on alert status mister spock
acknowledged
approaching ion storm sir
warp factor one mister hanson
warp one sir there another sharp jerk and kirk presses button on his chair panel
reverse stop go forward with magnification on the panel freeze that captain kirk is now signalling yellow alert go forward normal view on courtroom viewscreen
call from the pod sir
tie in
make it fast ben may have to go to red alert
hold our course mister hanson
aye aye sir natural vibrations force two captain force three
engineering then ion pod
aye aye sir
one third more thrust
stand by to get out of there ben
force five sir
steady as she goes mister hanson and the close up on the captain panel shows
freeze that if the court will notice the log plainly shows the defendant finger pressing the jettison button the condition signal reads yellow alert not red alert but simply yellow alert when the pod containing lieutenant commander finney was jettisoned the emergency did not as yet exist
but that not the way it happened captain log stardate 2949 the evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court-martial was damning suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me
computers don lie
are you suggesting that did
suggesting that maybe you did have lapse it was possible you know with the strain you were under there still time to change our plea could get you off
two days ago would ve staked anything on my judgment
you did your professional career
spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one my whole life is it possible that when the moment came no know what did you can pull out if you want to
there no place to go except back to court and hear the verdict communicator beeps
kirk here
captain
ve run complete megalyte survey on the computer
ll tell you what you found nothing right
you sound bitter captain
not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts
further instructions
no it not all bad mister spock who knows you may be able to beat your next captain at chess kirk out
chess the door opens
jamie this is lieutenant commander finney daughter
mister cogley we ve got to stop this make him take ground assignment realise it wasn his fault won make any trouble make him change his plea
it too late for that jamie but glad you don blame me anymore for what happened
was just so upset that night sorry
don say any more
but have to never realised how close you and dad had been until read through some papers he wrote letters to mother and me don know how ever could ve thought that you mister cogley ruining jim won change what happened
that very commendable miss finney but most unusual after all captain kirk is accused of causing your father death and the evidence would indicate his guilt
was just thinking of jim
know and thank you have to go and change you ready
no but may be getting ready
bishop half level right
well had to see it to believe it
explain
they re about to lop off the captain professional head and you re sitting here playing chess with the computer
that is true
mister spock you re the most cold-blooded man ve ever known
why thank you doctor ve just won my fourth game
that impossible
observe for yourself rook to king pawn four
bishop half level right
now this is the computer move and now mine takes the bishop checkmate mechanically the computer flawless therefore logically its report of the captain guilt is infallible could not accept that however
so you tested the programme bank
exactly programmed it myself for chess some months ago the best should have been able to attain was draw
well why are you just sitting there
transporter room stand by we re beaming down
court is now in session the board will entertain motions before delivering its verdict counsel for the prosecution
sir the prosecution rests
counsel for the defence
sir the defence rests mccoy and spock run in and whisper to kirk and cogley
mister cogley mister cogley
sir some new evidence has just been brought to my attention like to ask the court to
objection counsel for the defence has rested his case
of what nature is this evidence
can tell you ll have to show you
mister cogley is well-known for his theatrics
is saving an innocent man career theatric
counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the bench
be delighted to sir now that ve got something human to talk about rights sir human rights the bible the code of hammurabi and of justinian magna carta the constitution of the united states fundamental declarations of the martian colonies the statutes of alpha three gentlemen these documents all speak of rights rights of the accused to trial by his peers to be represented by counsel the rights of cross-examination but most importantly the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him right to which my client has been denied
your honour that is ridiculous we produced the witnesses in court my learned opponent had the opportunity to see them cross-examine them
all but one the most devastating witness against my client is not human being it machine an information system the computer log of the enterprise can ask this court adjourn and reconvene aboard that vessel
protest your honour
and repeat speak of rights machine has none man must my client has the right to face his accuser and if you do not grant him that right you have brought us down to the level of the machine indeed you have elevated that machine above us ask that my motion be granted and more than that gentlemen in the name of humanity fading in the shadow of the machine demand it demand it captain log stardate 2950 after due consideration the general court-martial has reconvened on board the enterprise
how many games of chess did you win from the computer mister spock
five in all
may that be considered unusual
affirmative
why
personally programmed the computer for chess months ago gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own the computer cannot make an error and assuming that do not either the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate and yet beat the machine five times someone either accidentally or deliberately adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer
could that have had an effect on the visual playback we saw
object the witness would be making conclusion
sustained
hypothetically mister spock hypothetically miss shaw if what you suggest had been done it would be beyond the capabilities of most men is that true
affirmative
what man aboard ship would it not be beyond
the captain myself and the records officer
and at the moment you have no records officer
affirmative until he was lost our records officer was lieutenant commander finney
captain kirk will you tell the steps you took to find mister finney after the storm
instituted phase one search
describe phase one search
it painstaking thorough attempt in and around the ship to find man who presumably injured and unable to respond
it presupposes does it not that man wishes to be found
beg your pardon
if you start search for man you assume don you that he wants to be found he not hiding
yes
on ship of this size could man evade such search
possibly
gentlemen submit to you that lieutenant commander ben finney is not dead
mister cogley we are waiting for proof of the extraordinary statement you made in the briefing room
you shall have it but first need the co-operation of this court in conducting an experiment captain kirk
gentlemen for the purposes of this experiment it ll be necessary for all personnel except for members of the court and the command crew to leave the ship am ordering all others to report to the transporter room
including myself sir
this court is by no means adjourned mister cogley
have an errand ashore of vital importance to the purpose of this court and will return
very well
thank you sir leaves with the spare crew members
captain are you maintaining an engine crew aboard
our impulse engines have been shut down we ll maintain orbit by momentum
and when the orbit decays
we hope to be finished long before that little later
ready mister spock
affirmative captain
gentlemen this computer has an auditory sensor it can in effect hear sounds by installing booster we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power the computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship
doctor mccoy all right mister spock cacophony of heartbeats comes over the bridge speakers
turn it down little gentlemen that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship doctor mccoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing
first the captain mister spock he goes around the assembled group one at time
and lastly myself
that all of us except for crewman in the transporter room mister spock eliminate his heartbeat that accounts for everyone but still one heart beats over the speakers
finney kirk; localise that
deck in or near engineering
seal off deck sections 18y through 23d
acknowledged
so finney is alive
it would seem so commodore this is my problem appreciate it if no one left the bridge armed with phaser kirk makes his way alone we felt jamie presence would make finney easier to handle in the event finney really were alive
ben
mister spock encountering variants
compensate
what does that mean
the orbit is beginning to decay
ben where are you
glad you re alive saved well you re wrong
ben ben it not too late we can help you ve watched you for years the great captain kirk we finally see the man as he jabs phaser into kirk back
they told you to do it to me you all conspired against me you ruined me but you won do it anymore he disarms kirk and throws the weapon away kirk turns to face him
put the phaser down ben
oh wouldn kill you captain your own death would mean too little to you but your ship
what about my ship
it dead ve killed it tapped out your primary energy circuits
mister spock what our orbit status
decaying captain
variants at second level
you re out of power know the ship too the enterprise should ve been mine you kept me from it
ben why kill innocent people
innocent officers and gentlemen captains all except for finney and his one mistake long time ago but they don forget
logged the mistake ben blame me not them
was good officer really was loved the service more than any man ever dared
mister spock we re running out of time
gentlemen if you ll please hurry to the transporter room
mister spock the court has not yet reached verdict we will hear this witness out
very well sir
it not too late you can be helped but if you kill those people
why shouldn they killed me didn they it fair trade
is jamie included in that deal
what do you mean
she on board by now yes she on board
what why did you do that why did you bring her here ll kill you kirk takes his opportunity to grapple with the bigger man there fight in which kirk shirt gets torn finney swings at kirk with wrench but finally has his lights punched out the prime energy circuits but not irreparable with luck would be able to effect repairs before our orbit decayed completely for repairs read pulling cables out of junction boxes
power returning mister spock up fourteen points and rising
activate port impulse engines one third power uhura takes navigation
one third power
variants fading
orbit stabilising
all secure sir
unless the prosecution has an objection rule this court to be dismissed
absolutely no objection sir later kirk is in fresh new shirt and talking quietly to areel in front of the turbolift doors around them it is business as usual
how long will it be this time before see you again
at the risk of sounding like mystic that depends on the stars
sam cogley asked me to give you something special it not first edition just book sam says that makes it special
didn have much of chance to thank him
he busy on case he defending ben finney he says he ll win
wouldn be bit surprised
do you think it would cause complete breakdown of discipline if lowly lieutenant kissed starship captain on the bridge of his ship
let try gentle but lingering kiss see no change discipline goes on
and so must the enterprise goodbye jim
goodbye areel better luck next time
had pretty good luck this time lost didn she leaves blowing him final kiss he pulls himself together goes to his chair and sits between two stony-faced officers
she very good lawyer
obviously
indeed she is
coming up on it fast sir
are you certain of your sensor readings
definitely space vessel of some type
origin
unknown it could hardly be an earth ship there have been no flights into this sector for years
picking up signal sir series of beeps comes over the speakers captain that the old morse code call signal
thank you
cq cq
we re reading it lieutenant thought you said it couldn possibly be an earth vessel
fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong
an emotional earth weakness of mine there it is the ship appears on the viewscreen
an old earth vessel similar to the dy=500 class
much older dy-100 class to be exact captain the last such vessel was built centuries ago back in the 1990s
then it derelict its signal left on automatic
or an old earth ship being used by aliens
weapons status
bioscanners report over there can be human though they re too faint and average only four beats per minute
sensor reading captain some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel
all decks go to full alert enterprise comes alongside the smaller ship which is still as big as the engineering hull captain log stardate 3141 full hour has elapsed since interception of the strange vessel our presence alongside is still being completely ignored although our sensors continue to show signs of equipment and life aboard there has been no indication of danger to us
weapons department maintain battle stations all other decks standby alert
all decks acknowledging sir
we re continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there very faint very slow seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies as near as can tell
alien bodies bones
could be there no sign of breathing or other form of respiration
hull surface is pitted with meteor scars however scanners make out name ss botany bay
then you can check the registry
no such vessel listed records of that period are fragmentary however the mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called world war
the eugenics wars
of course your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding
now wait minute not our attempt mister spock group of ambitious scientists sure you know the type devoted to logic completely unemotional
all right all right gentlemen as you were rig for tractor beam helm lock onto that vessel
rigging for tractor beam sir
the bridge is yours mister spock care to join the landing party doctor
well if you re actually giving me choice
not oh ll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-century earth here chance for that historian to do something for change what her name mcivers
lieutenant mcgivers lt mcgivers is just about to settle down to some painting when room engineering officer scott lieutenant mcgivers acknowledge
mcgivers on my way
well it looks like that ship was expecting us we read heat coming on complete oxygen atmosphere
very interesting you ready bones
no signed aboard this ship to practice medicine not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget
you re an old-fashioned boy mccoy where that historian mcgivers enters come on lieutenant
mcgivers sir
energise men and women are lying in clear-sided
scotty
definitely earth-type mechanism sir twentieth century vessel old type atomic power bulky solid think they used to call them transistor units love to tear this baby apart
captain it sleeper ship
suspended animation
ve seen old photographs of this necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018 it took years just to travel from one planet to another
is it possible they re still alive after centuries of travel
it theoretically possible ve never heard of it being tested for this long period
what handsome group of people
jim have new reading the lights must have triggered some mechanism
captain look here they go to the compartment holding dark-haired man
scotty
beats me what happening
we ve triggered something all right his heart beat increasing now passing eight beats per minute there are some signs of respiration beginning
this one was probably programmed to be triggered first
could he be the leader the leader lieutenant
dragging herself back from just gazing at the man yes sir the leader was often set to revive first this would allow him to decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others
heart beat now approaching forty per minute the respiration pattern is firming up
from the northern india area guess probably sikh they were the most fantastic warriors
heart beat now fifty two and increasing
the others
there no change and they re mixed types western mid-european latin oriental
man from the twentieth century coming alive
maybe heart beat dropping
circuit shorting
probably some dust
heartbeat now thirty dropping fast it heart flutter he dying
do something captain
can we
it take an hour to figure it out
what happens if we get him out of there
he ll die in seconds if we don kirk uses something metal in his hand to break the glass and open the compartment the man is slid out on trolley gasping and awake he tries to speak
how long
how long have you been sleeping two centuries we estimate landing party to enterprise come in
go ahead boarding party we read you
lock in on mccoy beam he transporting back with casualty we discovered here
magnificent captain log supplemental alongside the ss botany bay for ten hours now boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel attempts to revive other sleepers await our success or failure with the casualty already beamed over doctor mccoy is frankly amazed at his physical and recuperative power
kirk to boarding party
scotty any records log books of any kind
negative captain it appears they were in suspended animation when the ship took off
how many alive operating thirty of those are women
kirk out seventy two alive group of people dating back to the 1990s discovery of some importance mister spock there are great many unanswered questions about those years
strange violent period in your history find no record what so ever of an ss botany bay captain the dy-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only with simple nuclear-powered engines star travel was considered impractical at that time it was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system and why no record of the trip
botany bay that was the name of penal colony on shores of australia wasn it if they took that name for their vessel
if you re suggesting this was penal deportation vessel you ve arrived at totally illogical conclusion
oh
your earth was on the verge of dark ages whole populations were being bombed out of existence group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships
yes so much for my theory still waiting to hear yours
even theory requires some facts captain so far have none
and that irritates you mister spock
irritation
yeah
am not capable of that emotion
my apologies mister spock you suspect some danger in them
insufficient facts always invites danger captain
well we better get some facts rig for towing
aye aye sir
make course for starbase twelve
aye sir at khan bedside
to nurse that ll be all she leaves
bones
he ll live
my compliments
no good but not that good there something inside this man that refuses to accept death look at that even as he is now his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine lung efficiency is fifty percent better mcgivers enters
an improved breed of human that what the eugenics war was all about
estimate he could lift us both with one arm it will be interesting to see if his brain matches his body
doctor will he live
it appears he will lieutenant leaves
like to talk to you they go out into the main area where mccoy is at his desk
if were to rate your performance as member of the landing party today
know sir sorry
lieutenant at any one time the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon the performance of single crewman and the fact that you find man strangely compelling to you personally
not personally captain professionally my profession is historian and when find specimen from the past alive in the sheer delight of examining his mind
and men were more adventuresome then bolder more colourful
yes sir think they were
good if can have honesty it easier to overlook mistakes that all
yes sir she leaves
pity you wasted your life on command jim you have made fair psychologist
fair leaves in the ward khan wakes gets out of bed and does some stretches he hears mccoy voice
sickbay to lab anything new on those bios
good mccoy out khan sees display of old medical instruments on the wall takes scalpel and is back in bed when mccoy walks in to check on him as the good doctor leans over khan grabs him by the throat and holds the blade to his neck
well either choke me or cut my throat make up your mind
english thought dreamed hearing it where am
you re in squeeze makes him lower his voice you re in bed holding knife at your doctor throat
answer my question
it would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery just under the left ear khan releases him
like brave man
was simply trying to avoid an argument takes the scalpel you re aboard the united spaceship enterprise your vessel is in tow
remember voice did hear it say had been sleeping for two centuries
that is correct
where is your captain have many questions mccoy goes to the intercom
have patient here with many questions captain little later and khan is sitting up more
james kirk commanding the starship enterprise
see
and your name
have few questions first what is your heading
our heading is starbase twelve planet in the gamma 400 star system our command base in this sector is that of any use to you
and my people
seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning
you will revive them
as soon as we reach starbase twelve
see
and now
khan is my name
khan nothing else
khan
what was the exact date of your lift off we know it was sometime in the early 1990s but
find myself growing fatigued doctor may we continue this questioning at some other time
the facts need mister khan will take very little time for example the nature of your expedition
jim little later might be better
captain wonder if could have something to read during my convalescence was once an engineer of sorts would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel
yes understand you have two hundred years of catching up to do
precisely
they re available to any patient on the viewing screen doctor mccoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes
thank you captain you are very co-operative
this khan is not what expected of twentieth century man
note he making considerable use of our technical library
common courtesy mister spock he ll spend the rest of his days in our time it only decent to help him catch up would you estimate him to be product of selective breeding
there is that possibility captain his age would be correct in 1993 group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations
well they were hardly supermen they were aggressive arrogant they began to battle among themselves
because the scientists overlooked one fact superior ability breeds superior ambition
interesting if true they created group of alexanders napoleons
have collected some names and made some counts by my estimate there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated
that fact isn in the history texts
would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty napoleons might still be alive khan is lounging showing off his chest and calves
ship historian lieutenant
marla mcgivers
yes
am told you participated in my rebirth
in small way
ve been reading up on starships but they have one luxury not mentioned in the manuals
don understand
beautiful woman my name is khan please sit and entertain me she perches on another bed
like some historical information about your ship its purpose and
and why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion
it comfortable
but it not attractive he takes her to mirror and loosens couple of strands at the back there soft natural simple
mister khan here on business
you find no pleasure here
my interest is scientific men of that is the world of the past sure you understand to actually talk to man of your century
there simple soft please remember
perhaps some other time when you feel more like talking about the past
glad you came please do it again the dining table is laid out and the senior staff are in dress uniform
very impressive are we expecting fleet admiral for dinner
lieutenant mcgivers idea to welcome khan to our century just how strongly is she attracted to him
well there aren any regulations against romance jim
my curiosity official not personal bones
well he has magnetism almost electric you felt it and it could over power mcgivers with her preoccupation with the past crewwoman shows khan in
thank you hoped you might guide me to our dinner engagement sees picture on the wall very good fine technique
it gladiator named flavius he once
and you ve rearranged your hair for me excellent
all bold men from the past richard leif ericson napoleon hobby of yours such men he uncovers work in progress man in turban
am honoured thank you but caution you such men dare take what they want he kisses her and she responds after dinner as liqueurs are being served
forgive my curiosity mister khan but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey
and how you managed to keep it out of the history books
adventure captain adventure there was little else left on earth
there was the war to end tyranny many considered that noble effort
tyranny sir or an attempt to unify humanity
unify sir like team of animals under one whip
know something of those years remember it was time of great dreams of great aspiration
under dozens of petty dictatorships
one man would have ruled eventually as rome under caesar think of its accomplishments
then your sympathies were with
you are an excellent tactician captain you let your second in command attack while you sit and watch for weakness
you have tendency to express ideas in military terms mister khan this is social occasion
it has been said that social occasions are only warfare concealed many prefer it more honest more open
you fled why were you afraid
ve never been afraid
but you left at the very time mankind needed courage
we offered the world order
we
excellent excellent but if you will excuse me gentlemen and ladies grow fatigued again with your permission captain will return to my quarters kirk stands and khan leaves khan is pacing when marla enters
wanted to apologise they had no right to treat you that way
quite understandable since something of mystery to them
you re no mystery to me know exactly who you are
do you
leif ericson richard the lion heart napoleon don know if you re going to like living in our time
then ll have to remold it to my liking embraces her
please don pushes her away
go or stay but do it because it is what you wish to do well
ll stay little longer
how many minutes do you graciously offer
only meant
this grows tiresome you must now ask to stay
like to stay please he takes her hand then forces her down onto her knees
open your heart will you open your heart
yes
intend to take this ship do you agree
oh please don ask me
need your help
you won harm anyone
now you question me
no
will you assist me
oh please khan don ask me
leave me then go say
no promise ll do anything you ask large picture of their guest in on screen
name khan as we know him today spock changes the picture name khan noonien singh
from 1992 through 1996 absolute ruler of more than quarter of your world from asia through the middle east
the last of the tyrants to be overthrown
must confess gentlemen ve always held sneaking admiration for this one
he was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous they were supermen in sense stronger braver certainly more ambitious more daring
gentlemen this romanticism about ruthless dictator is
mister spock we humans have streak of barbarism in us appalling but there nevertheless
there were no massacres under his rule
and as little freedom
no wars until he was attacked
gentlemen
mister spock you misunderstand us we can be against him and admire him all at the same time
illogical
totally this is the captain put twenty four hour security on mister khan quarters effective immediately khan is seated at plain table dressed in red enterprise uniform shirt when kirk bursts in and sits opposite him
sorry captain was lost in thought my door locked from outside guard posted
unusual treatment for khan noonien singh
excellent you identified me with your computer system imagine
like those answers now first the purpose of your star flight
new life chance to build world other things doubt you would understand
why because not product of controlled genetics
captain although your abilities intrigue me you are quite honestly inferior mentally physically in fact am surprised how little improvement there has been in human evolution oh there has been technical advancement but how little man himself has changed yes it appears we will do well in your century captain do you have any other questions
thank you they ve all been answered he leaves and the guard resumes his post khan summons his strength wrenches the locked door open and knocks out his guard with single blow marla is holding phaser on the transporter chief
move away khan comes in and incapacitates him with pressure at the base of the skull she beams him to the botany bay freshly revived supermen and women are stretching their muscles when khan greets them
otto joaquin the trip is over the battle begins again only this time it not world we win it universe kati
on course sir warp factor two
maintain he answers the intercom bridge
sound security alert
security alert captain communication channels are down captain kirk heads to the lift but the doors do not open
turbo elevators inoperative jammed captain kirk rushes to panel on the far bulkhead and pushes buttons
atmospheric controls cut off
useless they re on override in engineering
engineering scotty this is the bridge
captain he gets knocked out
what going on down there
he not able to answer you at the moment captain life-support system to your bridge and jammed up your exit routes am willing to negotiate
flood all decks with neural gas
impossible intruder control systems inoperative mister khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals
contact starbase twelve
all channels are totally jammed captain
brilliant every contingency anticipated
do you surrender the bridge
negative
academic captain refuse suffocate little later with everyone else unconscious kirk makes his last log entry stardate 3142 they have my ship discarding their own worthless vessel only moments of air left on the bridge now commendations recommended for lieutenant uhura technicians first class thule and harrison lieutenant spinelli and of course mister spock take full responsibility take full he passes out the senior staff are awake again and listening to speech at gunpoint
nothing ever changes except man your technical accomplishments improve mechanical device and you may double productivity but improve man and you gain thousand fold am such man join me ll treat you well need your training to operate vessel this complex
where is captain kirk
see now made one serious error you are the communications officer engage the viewing screen please uhura doesn move so joaquin drags her to the table then hits her as he raises his hand again marla intervenes
no
should have realised that suffocating together on the bridge would create heroic camaraderie among you but it is quite different thing to watch it happening to someone else engage the viewing screen sure you recognise your medical decompression chamber here doctor and the meaning of that indicator it is dropping to 10hg your captain will die if you join me mister spock will save his life my vessel was useless need you and yours to select colony planet one with population willing to be led by us
to be conquered by you starship would make that most simple wouldn it
each of you in turn will go in there die while the others watch
khan there no reason must watch this is there
shakes his head but hoped you would be stronger she leaves if any one of you joins me anyone ll let him live it so useless
we ve lost the channel how do regain picture
it does not matter the captain is dead take mister spock next there is one young man standing guard by the chamber door
khan said to watch him very closely he may decide to co-operate as he turns to look in the porthole she injects him he passes out and she repressurises the chamber freeing kirk
captain saved your life now please don kill him the outer sickbay door opens kirk waits and then tackles spock guard spock neck-pinches him
surprised to see you captain though pleased
little pleased myself situation
khan is holding our staff in the briefing room his men have control of the ship
our only chance is the intruder control circuit although he cut it off at the bridge
there relay junction down the corridor
gas all decks but this one
armoury this is khan report rodriguez ling mcpherson anyone report status gas starts coming out of the ventilation grill khan flees scott hits guard and gives chase everyone else coughs
where khan
don know he got out just as the gas
kirk here just closed that line khan is working controls and listening to the intercom messages suspect section ll follow in case lasts meet me in the armoury blowing it clear first spock out kirk dashes into engineering and straight into khan who easily disarms him then crushes the phaser then an alarm beeps
if understood your manuals that an overload in progress your ship flares up like an exploding sun within minutes the two fight khan can throw kirk around with little effort
have five times your strength you re no match for me but kirk gets himself weapon and clubs khan into unconsciousness before stopping the overload and saving his ship captain log stardate 3143 control of the enterprise has been regained wish my next decisions were no more difficult khan and his people what waste to put them in reorientation centre and what do do about mcgivers the senior staff are in dress uniform again
record tapes engaged and ready captain
this hearing is now in session under the authority vested in me by starfleet command declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped
jim agreed you have the authority
mister spock our heading takes us near the ceti alpha star system
quite correct captain planet number five there is habitable although bit savage somewhat inhospitable
but no more than australia botany bay colony was at the beginning those men went on to tame continent mister khan can you tame world
have you ever read milton captain
yes understand lieutenant marla mcgivers given choice of court martial or accompanying them there
gazing into her eyes it will be difficult struggle at first even to stay alive to find food
ll go with him sir
superior woman will take her and ve gotten something else wanted world to win an empire to build
this hearing is closed khan and mcgivers are escorted out
it shame for good scotsman to admit it but not up on milton
the statement lucifer made when he fell into the pit it is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven
it would be interesting captain to return to that world in hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today
yes mister spock it would indeed
earth-style distress signal sos
ve answered it on all frequencies sir they don reply
not vessel ground source the third planet in this solar system according to my instruments
directly ahead definitely an earth-style signal
we re hundreds of light years from earth mister spock no colonies or vessels out this far
measuring the planet now captain it spheroid-shaped circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons mean density five point five one seven atmosphere oxygen nitrogen
earth
not the earth another earth another earth captain log stardate 2713 in the distant reaches of our galaxy we have made an astonishing discovery earth type radio signals coming from planet which apparently is an exact duplicate of the earth it seems impossible but there it is
hold us in fixed orbit mister spock
affirmative captain
still no response communications
none captain
we ll beam down alert security prepare to transport landing party to surface we ll land in the vicinity of the distress signals now being received
identical earth as it was in the early 1900s
more the er mid-1900s would say captain approximately 1960
but where is everybody
readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking place on this planet for at least several centuries
you mean there no one alive
not conclusive yeoman the evidence would suggest that the distress signal is automated
now this is marvellous the most horrible conglomeration of antique architecture ve ever seen
mister spock comes upon child tricycle
mine mine attacks mccoy mine mine mine mine mine mine kirk drags him off and hits him several times it it broke somebody broke it fix somebody please fix
of course somebody will fix it
definitely humanoid in spite of the distortion
but with the mind of child bones what is it
seizure of some type
we want to help you
liar fibber fibber fibber fibber fibber fibber fibber
it dead it incredible
what is
its metabolic rate it impossibly high as if it burning itself up almost as if it aged century in just the past few minutes
sound of running come on
how old is this thing
about three hundred years
sound in the closet come out we mean you no harm opens door
don hurt me please
not going to hurt you
no please don didn do anything
won hurt you
no please don
only want to talk to you
no don don hurt
come on
don please
won hurt you
don hurt me
come on it all right come on
we won hurt you sweetheart we re your friends no shh
take the guards have look outside radioactive readings chemical pollutions any further sign of life
right captain
wonder what happened to her that she should be so terrified of us someone clears patch of grime from window spock goes over and peers in
but remember the things you grups did burning yelling hurting people
we didn do anything like that
you re not going to hurt
well of course not we re here to help
grups don help
but we will
what happened here where is everybody
you know
no don won you tell me
you got foolie is that it and you want me to play but can don know the rules ve got to know the rules
foolie
game you know you can play game without rules even grups ought to know that
what are grups
you are they will when onlies get old
grownups
you said something about the grups doing bad things yelling hurting burning
that was when they started to get sick in the before time we hid then they were gone am doing all right
you re doing fine
you said the grups got sick is that why there aren any of them around
yes they died but that was after the awful things
plague captain that could explain lot of it
but what about the children the onlies didn the awful things affect them
of course not we re here aren we
more of you how many
all there are
what your name
miri
miri pretty name for pretty young woman
pretty
very pretty
guards cover me nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah
children captain lots of them we couldn begin to get close to them they just seemed to scurry away like animals only children
miri said all the adults died
that creature which attacked us was certainly no child perhaps it died of the disease the girl talking about
there must be records somewhere and answers to some of our questions miri do you know any buildings where the doctors used to work
yes know that them and their pills and things
will you take me there
that bad place
it important please
all right do you have name too
yes it jim
like that name
good like yours too like you
do you really
wouldn lie to you
wouldn lie to you either jim remember the grups but you re nice you re different
why thank you sees mark on his hand
it already starting knew it would just like it did with the grups it ll spread all over you and you ll yell and you ll try to hurt everybody and then you ll die knew it would knew it would captain log stardate 2713 the building miri led us to also housed an automatic transmission station which sent out the signal that drew us to this planet we also discovered something else that the blues blotches characteristic of the unknown disease had appeared on each of us with the exception of mister spock there was well-equipped laboratory in the building doctor mccoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate the organism responsible
veritable zoo of bacteria beam down biocomputer and portable electronic microscope if dealing with viruses ll need better equipment than have here
yes doctor
yes lieutenant
ve got volunteers standing by ready to help you sir
under no circumstances do want anyone to beam down from the ship we can take any chances with further contamination
my orders still stand lieutenant you can help us best by clearing the computer banks and standing by kirk out bones why do you think the symptoms haven appeared in mister spock
don know probably the little bugs or whatever they are have no appetite for green blood
being red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages now there you have museum piece doctor referring to microscope lens type manually operated light-activated
spare me the analysis mister spock please it is enough that it works
it spreads real fast know when you re old it covers you like anything
reading intermediate experimentation report project on life prolongation
progress report genetics section life prolongation project
so that what it was
life prolongation didn have much luck did they captain log doctor mccoy biocomputer and portable electronic microscope have been beamed down from the enterprise they will be used in conjunction with computer banks on-board ship
tubular with extreme multiplicability appear to have affinity for nucleic acids give me what you have
this was three hundred years ago captain
all the adults are dead only the children are left alive
but children become adults
at least they have up to now
doctor there are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty are there not
of course it changes the entire body system you know that of course you know that why
is it not possible that these children here as they enter puberty contract the disease
that would explain why there are no adults
glandular post-pubescent could be
it illogical it does not follow all the adults on this planet died three hundred years ago but there are children in the streets
who die when they enter adolescence
but how do they keep the line going
one thing captain if she were wild animal ever since she been little girl how do you explain that she wants to stay with us
loneliness don know curiosity think children have an instinctive need for adults they want to be told right and wrong
there may be other emotions at work in this case captain
she likes you jim
she becoming woman
mister spock
spock here power metabolic rate seventy two percent production of nucleic acids reduced to thirty three percent of normal conventional chronological progression one hundred by three point six
acknowledged lieutenant have their calculations now
to redshirts try again see if you can find anything outside to miri hey clean up that desk for me will you
all right jim
thank you
according to their life prolongation plan what they thought they were accomplishing person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time
one hundred years and only one month
exactly yeoman evidently through some miscalculation this virus annihilated the entire adult population in very short period leaving only the children
but that means these children
could very well be immensely old
that would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents
answers it very well
children who never age eternal childhood filled with play no responsibilities it almost like dream
wouldn examine that dream too closely yeoman it might not turn out to be very pretty
few days ago or week ago that creature that attacked us could have been just like miri child entering puberty on this planet means death sentence
do you suppose she knows
don think so
if they re as old as spock claims they must have some idea of what happening
there no adult interpretation think we re dealing with children immensely old perhaps but nonetheless children we ve got to do something about the others
difficult if we can even get glimpse of them
you couldn get close to the other kids
impossible they know the area too well like mice
going to try miri come here you want to go someplace with me
sure leave holding hands
that little girl
is at least three hundred years older than you are yeoman think about it
miri is with them why why
what she going to do jahn
don don know know what we ve got to do there are more of them than we see somewhere up in the sky maybe somewhere they talk to each other all the time you know grups you know what they do the hurting the killing
remember jahn the way it was
that right the way it was in the before time they talk to the other grups with these little boxes now if they didn have those little boxes they be all alone huh
but they don see us we hide olly olly oxen free
olly olly oxen free olly olly oxen free olly olly oxen free
no it not game it real they re dangerous they re grups don you understand
jahn
sees kirk and miri approach the building all right let hide kirk and miri come in then changing girl appears the children flee screaming the girl jumps kirk and he eventually stuns her
dead don understand it my phaser wasn set to kill
her name was louise she was just little bit older than am when it happened oh jim she hugs him mister spock stand by
acknowledged
sharpening pencils are these enough jim
we could use some more if you don mind
no don mind
there couldn be any doubt about what you found here
this fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began disregard these last entries he said himself he was too sick too far gone to be sure he wasn already mad and agree but based on the entries he made before that know how much time we have the ship computers will verify my figures
only matter of time before we all go mad destroy each other till the last of us finally destroys himself
what about miri
our guess was correct they contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes the notes would indicate it doesn become acute for month or so estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left
what about us
the older the victim the more rapid the progress of the disease
and you the disease doesn seem to be interested in you
am carrier whatever happens can go back to the ship and do want to go back to the ship captain
of course mister spock we still don know what we re fighting
no but we know what it is and how fast it does it it progressing we ll begin to feel it inside soon intense fever great pain in the extremities fuzziness of vision of course those are the early symptoms there ll be more
are you certain about the time we have left
presume my calculations are correct
is there any possibility
spock here spock
verified captain we have seven days captain log supplement this is the second day of the seven left to us we ve found nothing enterprise is standing by with labs and computers ready to assist us
there no data no starting point
think ve found it
janice take miri for walk
yes sir
only one half intact
but do you know what they were up to
more or less the idea was to create new series of diseases chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably
unfortunately they weren successful we ve seen the results
you two will have to recreate their thinking if you can isolate that virus we ll be able to develop vaccine
is that all captain we have five days you know
know
the children all dash out while jahn sneaks in and collects the communicators from the desks
anything
no nothing
and you clunk as grate closes
communicators captain they re gone
jim we ve absolutely got to have those communicators without them we don have the computers and without the computers we don have chance captain log stardate 2717 three days seven hours left to us investigation proves that the supply of food in the area is running dangerously low unless something is done the children will starve in few months the disease is working on each of us according to doctor mccoy prediction our tempers are growing short and we re no further along than we were two days ago
haven you found thing yet
would you like to take crack at it
as kirk pushes past and makes her drop flasks no no no runs out kirk follows then miri
upset so upset back on the ship used to try to get you to look at my legs captain look at my legs covered in blotches
holds her we re all frightened miri leaves
the last slide examined failed to make the necessary adjustment the slowing down of my own responses
never mind that what did you find
the disease captain the one they created three hundred years ago
there chance
chance at least it race now and we ve just wasted minute
that would be some foolie miri but do you think it would work
know know don you think ve heard them talk they have such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs this baninski thing if we get her away that yeoman that one person less to start off with
but how miri if they re so busy if they re going to have the big emergency how are you going to get her away
it easy she always asking me about the youngest little onlies little ones what if they get sick who takes care of them do they have enough to eat where do they sleep ll just tell her one of you fell down and got hurt
me say it me
all right you
but grups they know things and all that you know bet they ll be able to do it with one person less
not one two because he ll try to find her
who who will miri
the captain he ll try to find her but he won mister lovey-dovey
lovey-dovey bonk bonk on the head bonk bonk bonk bonk
bonk bonk bonk bonk
it looks right
the nitrogen cycle it has to be
but the question is what the dosage
that is very good question
where is she miri where is she miri where janice
what the matter with you how should know
where is she has something happened to her
don you feel all right
no don feel all right none of us feel all right can you see what going on
jim don want anything to happen to you
ve got to find janice
that not all captain we ve got to find those communicators
we re trying mister spock we re trying very hard
that not good enough this could be it but we can test it without the ship computers
we ve got to have those communicators jim
this is the vaccine
that what the computers will tell us
without them it could be beaker full of death
did you hear them we only have few hours left
don care
you ve got to care miri going to tell you something you your friends all the onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we re doing you ve seen your friends get it
sometimes it happens
not sometimes all the times miri as soon as you start growing up the way you are don you know why you don like to play games anymore why you don see your friends the way you used to it because you re becoming young woman and the moment you become young woman you get the disease all of you
that not true it just happens sometimes
all the time miri it happening to you right now look at it look at it miri it in you
no no no
blah blah blah
no you got the wrong game teacher told you now what does teacher say huh
yeah study study study or bonk bonk bad kid children all applaud
it not funny
it foolie
what are you going to do with me
you think tell you miri you re not supposed to be here
know
what the matter something go wrong
no
okay then don just stand there in the doorway come on in
listen to him
you listen miri
did why do you think brought him here tell them jim
tell em jim tell em jim
tell em jim tell em jim tell em jim tell em jim
listen to me listen to me
no yelling in the classroom look at him very bad citizen
this isn game it never was game
call the police
the police bonk bonk unless you re good
you re the teacher
got two jobs bonk bonk
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
listen to me you ve got our communicators the boxes we talk into we need them to talk to the ship
blah blah blah
no blah blah blah because if we don talk to the ship if you don help us there won be any games anymore there won be anything nothing no grups no onlies nobody left forever and ever
sees boy with club coming up behind him captain
now listen to me you ve got to help us before it too late let janice go give me those communicators before it too late
approaching menacingly nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah nyah na nyah
you ve seen your friends change one by one as they grew up did you ever see one of them not change one by one they got the disease and they became like iike those creatures you re afraid of like louise one by one they changed and got the disease the disease like ve got like miri has you understand what talking about you re not babies we can help you
naughty grup starts hitting kirk bonk bonk bonk bonk
no please no the other children join in as the little blonde girl watches smiling
bleeding it waiting for you it may only be matter of months
listen to him he telling the truth
he funny he thinks he funny
bonk bonk get him
look at my arms that what going to happen to you unless you let me help you
bonk bonk hit him
and the little ones what going to happen to them after you ve gone after you ve turned into creatures like louise oh they ll still be here but not for long because the food all gone you ve eaten it maybe six months left that all and then nothing left to eat nobody left to take care of them they ll die too
look at my arm jahn it happening to me he telling the truth

we can wait for those communicators any longer
we must the vaccine could be fatal
the disease certainly is how long do we have left hours minutes how much longer do you want to wait
bickering is pointless ll check on the captain progress spock leaves mccoy picks up the hypospray and injects himself then collapses in agony
spock
is he dead mister spock
not yet
with children and communicators three hours eleven minutes left thank you lieutenant keep this channel open clear your computers what happened to him
he injected himself with the vaccine he was unconscious when found him
look at his face
the blemishes are fading they re fading who will understand the medical mind
is this supposed to be good thing miri
of course it is
they were just children simply to leave them there with medical team
just children three hundred years old and more ve already contacted space central they ll send teachers advisers
and truant officers presume
they ll be all right
miri she really loved you you know
yes never get involved with older women yeoman mister spock
captain
full ahead warp factor one
warp factor one captain two men in colonial style clothing complete with tri-corn hats are running for their lives one falls
neil we ve got to keep going come on get up
it no use they re everywhere
the captain gave us an order we ve got to find some clue
it no use mister sulu look there one of them there another one ominous figures in long red gowns and hoods are slowly advancing on them carrying staves
scouting party to enterprise
what is it mister sulu
captain beam us up quick emergency
transporter room lock onto sulu and neil beam up immediately
we ve got to make run for it we can just stand here
mister neil stand tight they ll beam us up any minute
run tell you we ve got to get out of here you know what they re capable of he makes dash for it
neil one of the robed figures reaches sulu and points his hollow stave at him sulu stiffens then relaxes with smile on his face the transporter takes him away
sulu what is it where lieutenant neil
what who
lieutenant neil where is he
you you re not of the body
doctor mccoy
doctor mccoy transporter room quickly
you you did it they knew we were archons these are the clothes they wear not these throws bundle at man and takes his jacket off
sulu take it easy
landru landru
sit down mccoy enters what happened
they re wonderful they re the sweetest friendliest people in the universe it paradise my friend paradise
lieutenant neil where is he
paradise paradise captain log stardate 3156 while orbiting planet beta three trying to find some trace of the starship archon that disappeared here hundred years ago search party consisting of two enterprise officers were sent to the planet below mister sulu has returned but in highly agitated mental state his condition requires beam down with an additional search detail the extensive landing party is now in more late 19th century american style clothes with bootlace ties and long jackets spock has cape with the hood raised to cover his ears
materialisation completed kirk out man walks slowly past them hand on his heart and smile on his face he bows politely and carries on his way
odd the expression on that man face the mindlessness vacant contentment
like sulu if everybody on this planet is like him let go
joy to you friends
joy to you
you be strangers come for the festival are ya
yes
got place to sleep it off yet go round to reger house he got rooms but you ll have to hurry it almost the red hour the town hall clock shows few minutes to six clock
this festival it starts at six clock
tula these folks come for the festival your daddy can put them up can he
you re from the valley
we ve just arrived
my father will be glad to put you up though it right over there the clock strikes the hour and everybody shouts and goes wild clothing gets loosened women are carries away by men there are shouts and screams everywhere
tula come windows are broken fights break out woman jumps on kirk and kisses him
let get out of here they run to reger house and get in three older men turn in surprise kirk; sorry to break in on you like this we didn expect that kind of welcome
welcome you are strangers
yes that right we re from the valley
you came for the festival
yes
then how come you here
are you reger
yes
you have daughter named tula
yes
well you better do something she outside
know it festival it the will of landru
reger these are young men they are not old enough to be excused
they re visitors
well have they no lawgivers in the valley why be they not at the festival
we heard that you might have rooms for us
there you see hacom they ve merely come looking for place to rest afterwards
the red hour has already struck
hacom these be strangers the valley has different ways
do you say that landru is not everywhere
no of course not it simply they may have different ways
they ve come looking for shelter can turn them away come please
but the girl out there
she is in festival as you should be
come please hurry he leads the way upstairs
the lawgivers should know
surely hacom they already know are they not infallible
you mock them you mock the lawgivers and the strangers are not of the body you will see
but hacom hacom leaves the house reger shows them into sparsely furnished room with bunk beds and turns up the gas light
you can return here at the close of the festival it quiet you ll have need of rest
we have no plans to attend the festival sir
the hour is struck you can hear
like to hear more about this festival and landru
alarmed landru you ask you re strange you scorn festival are you are you
what about landru outside are scenes of rioting willful destruction of property random violence and lust reger leaves the group unseen to us
festival festival
landru my guess is we have until morning let put the time to good use doctor do atmospheric readings to determine whether there anything in the air to account for all this mister lindstrom correlate all that you ve seen with any other sociological parallels if any mister spock you and have some serious thinking to do when we leave here tomorrow morning want to have plan of action kirk as sixth man in the group didn get bunk bed or chair to sleep on when the town clock strikes am everybody outside stops and then goes on their placid way as if nothing had happened
spock spock lindstrom doc they hear crying outside and go to investigate
no no it all over now it all over now child that all right quiet
excuse me leads the distressed tula away
it all right it all over
he ll give her shot it ll calm her down trust us
you didn even try to bring her back what kind of father are you
it landru will
what about landru who is he
it is true then you did not attend the festival last night
no
then you re not of the body you couldn be
she asleep
are you are you archons
what if we are
it was said more would follow if you are indeed
we must hide them quickly the lawgivers
we can take care of ourselves
landru will know he will come hacom storms in with two robed figures
he is the one he mocked the lawgivers heard him
no hacom it was jest
the others they were here but they scorned the festival saw it
tamar stand clear
hear and obey the voice of landru the lawgiver kills him with his hollow stave
you attacked the body you have heard the word and disobeyed you will be absorbed
what do you mean absorbed
there you see not of the body
you will be absorbed the good is all landru is gentle you will come
we re not going anywhere
it is the law you must come
said we re not going anywhere the two lawgivers turn and face each other
evidently they re not prepared to deal with out right disobedience how did you know
everything we ve seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action
your analysis seems logical
it is clear that you simply did not understand will re-phrase you are ordered to accompany us to the absorption chambers
why did you kill that man
out of order you will obey it is the word of landru
you tell landru that we ll come in our own time and that we ll speak to him kirk takes the stave from the lawgiver and hands it to spock for inspection
you cannot it is landru
landru hacom leaves quickly
fascinating this is merely hollow tube captain no mechanism
they re communing we have time come with me
where to
to place know you ll be safe there but we must hurry landru will come they hurry slowly smiling and bowing to passers by
quite festival they had
peace
what do you make of all this
totally illogical yesterday without apparent cause or reason they wrought total havoc yet today now
now they re back to normal
morning friends
good morning bilar
your daughter that the man
no it wasn bilar it was landru let hurry we haven much time but few paces further on the passers by all stop
it too late look
what is it
landru he summoning the body
telepathy captain the people pick up weapons from the debris in the street
phasers on stun which way reger
perhaps through there but landru
we ll handle landru just get us out of this they get trapped in an alley
don want to hurt them warn them back
they re in the body it landru
phasers on stun wide field fire they drop the first wave but more come
fire they get down the alley
security
captain
lieutenant neil he one of our men
not anymore he been absorbed
bring him along
the lieutenant is one of them when he wakes landru will find us through him leave him there he our enemy he been absorbed
captain now that we ve got lieutenant neil let beam up out of here
we still don know what happened to the archons which way bring him along reger leads them into building made of massive stones he goes over to corner and unwraps flat panel which gives off light
put him over there
lighting panel
amazing in this culture
comes from time before landru
before landru how long ago was that
nobody knows positively some say as long ago as six thousand years
it took very advanced technology to construct device like this inconsistent with this environment
but not inconsistent with what we ve seen security the two spare members of the group go to stand guard
those staffs hollow tubes antennae for some sort of broadcast power what is it mister spock
strong power generations captain near here but radiating in all directions
he ll be coming around soon captain
he must not he been absorbed
absorbed
the body absorbs its enemies it only kills when it has to when the first archons came they were free out of control opposing the will of landru many were killed many more were absorbed when he regains consciousness landru will find us through him and if the others come
what others
those like you and me who resist landru
an underground how are you organised
in threes myself tamar who dead now and one other
who
don know tamar was my contact
give me decision captain he coming out of it
he must not regain consciousness he ll destroy us all he of the body
give him shot keep him asleep reger want some answers this underground if landru is so powerful how do you survive
don know captain some of us escape the directives not many but few it was that way when the first archons came
the archons tell me about them
they had invaded the body but they resisted the will of landru you see landru had pulled them down from the skies
pulled them down from the skies starship mister spock those power readings you took are they
powerful enough to destroy starship affirmative
kirk to enterprise come in
captain we re under attack there are heat beams of some kind coming up from the planet surface
our shields are holding but they re taking all our power impulse we ll lose our shields and burn up like cinder
orbit condition
checking we re going down captain unless we can get those beams off us so we can use our engines we re due to hit atmosphere in less than twelve hours
keep your shield up do everything you can to maintain orbit we ll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here circuits but they haven been effective the conversation ends in crackle of static
captain
what is it
sensor beams very strong we re being probed in this direction
landru
block them out
too strong captain can be blocked
adopting prayerful posture oh the image of tall elegant man draped in robes appears against wall
am landru
projection captain unreal
but beautiful mister spock with no apparatus at this end
you have come as destroyers you bring an infection
you are holding my ship demand that you release it
you have come to world without hate without fear without conflict no war no disease no crime none of the ancient evils landru seeks tranquillity peace for all the universal good
we mean you no harm ours is mission of peace and good will
the good must transcend the evil it shall be done so it has been since the beginning
he doesn hear you captain
drawing his phaser maybe he ll hear this
put that away landru listen to me
you will be absorbed your individuality will merge into the unity of the good and in your submergence into the common being of the body you will find contentment and fulfillment you will experience the absolute good
oh sound permeates the room and knocks everyone out captain log stardate 3157 the enterprise still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of beta three is now being commanded by engineering officer scott the shore party has been taken by the creature called landru kirk wakes up in chamber very like the previous one constructed of large stone blocks but without the furniture stone door has no handle on the inside his communicator and phaser are gone
mister spock wake up mister lesley
where doctor mccoy
he was gone when woke up along with the other guard and mister neil
should say they ve been here and been removed
where is here
evidently maximum security establishment are you armed
no all our phasers are gone checked that locked
oh does my head ache
the natural result of being subjected to hypersonic
oh is that what it was
sound waves stronger they might have killed us as it was they merely rendered us unconscious
enough analysis let think of way to get out of here what about the lawgivers inability to cope with the unexpected
we shouldn depend on that happening again captain in society as well organised as this one seems to be cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected interesting however their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data
are you suggesting the lawgivers are mere computers that they aren human
quite human captain it simply that all the facts are not yet in there are gaps the door opens and lawgiver escorts mccoy and neil in then leaves them again
doc how
hello friend we were told to wait here
doc
can help you friend
don you know me
we all know one another and landru
like sulu
think man the enterprise the ship remember
you speak very strangely friend are you from away
you do remember
ask landru he remembers he knows and he watches you are strange are you not of the body the door opens again and lawgiver points his hollow stave at kirk
come
no
then you will die
you ve been corrected captain you better go
all right work on bones see if you can
come kirk leaves with the lawgivers
doctor mccoy what will happen to him
he goes to joy peace and tranquillity he goes to meet landru happiness is to all of us blessed by landru kirk is secured to the wall by his wrists stout bald man comes in and relieves the lawgiver on duty
am marplon it is your hour happy communing
with thanks happy communing marplon steps into the control booth spock is attempting mind meld on mccoy
well
impossible he under extremely powerful control
are we just going to stand here
little else we can do unless you can think of way to get through that door
well this is simply ridiculous bunch of stone age characters running around in robes
and apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension not simple not ridiculous very very dangerous the door opens and this time the stave is pointed at spock
you come kirk is released and greets spock with an inane smile on his face
joy to you friend peace and contentment will fill you you will know the peace of landru kirk leaves and spock is fastened to the wall for his treatment the lights waver as the lawgivers leave marplon to his work
have no fear friend the effect is harmless my name is marplon was too late to save your first two friends they have been absorbed beware of them spock is released
what about the captain
he is unharmed unchanged am the third man in reger triad we have been awaiting your return
we are not archons marplon
whatever you may call yourselves you are in fulfillment of prophecy we ask your help
where is reger
he will join us he is immune to absorption hurry we have not much time
who is landru
cannot answer your questions now landru he will hear here are your weapons you may need them lawgivers enter
behave as you saw your captain behave it is done
joy be with you peace and contentment
captain
peace and tranquillity to you in whisper are you all right
quite all right be careful of doctor mccoy
understand landru
am formulating theory captain
and
not here the doctor
you speak in strange whispers this is not the way of landru
joy be yours and tranquillity my friend
and peace and harmony are you of the body
the body is one
blessed be the body and health to all of its parts
my friends guiding red and spock away to quiet corner what is your theory mister spock
this is soulless society captain it has no spirit no spark all is indeed peace and tranquillity the peace of the factory the tranquillity of the machine all parts working in unison
and when something unexplained happens their routine is disrupted
until new orders are received the question is who gives those orders
landru
there is no landru captain not in the human sense
you re thinking the same thing am mister spock the plug must be pulled
sir
landru must die
captain our prime directive of non-interference
that refers to living growing culture do you think this one is marplon and reger enter
joy to you all friends
it is the gift of landru goes over to kirk ve brought your signalling devices you may need them
what we need is more information about landru reger shakes his head you said you wanted us to help you
the prophecy says
never mind what the prophecy says if you want to be liberated from landru we ll need your help
captain
you re not of the body
peace
you re not
to you friend joy and tranquillity
lawgivers peace
lawgivers trying to strangle kirk traitor traitors traitors spock deals with neil
doc don want to hurt you
traitors kirk manages to get sleeper hold on mccoy and he passes out
spock more lawgivers enter and are overpowered spock uses punch to knock his one out
isn that somewhat old-fashioned robes they undress the lawgivers and put on their robes
where is landru
no no
where do we find him
we do not see him we hear him in the hall of audiences
in this building
reluctantly yes
you re going to take us there the two men are terrified at the prospect spock call the enterprise
no
snap out of it start acting like men
spock to enterprise status report
mister spock ve been trying to reach you
report scott
the orbit still decaying give it six hours more or less you ve got to cut them off mister spock or we ll cook
scotty stand by we re doing the best we can how mister sulu
put guard on him
on sulu
that an order watch him captain out
captain gives him phaser kirk; all right about landru
there was war convulsions the world was destroying itself landru was our leader he saw the truth he changed the world he took us back back to simple time time of peace and tranquillity
what happened to him
he still alive he is here now he sees he hears we have destroyed ourselves please no more
you said you wanted freedom it time you learned that freedom is never gift it has to be earned come on we re going to find landru
no no was wrong submit bear myself to the will of landru
it too late for that
no lawgivers help help me spock neck-pinches him
all right it up to you take us to landru outside the door
this is the hall of audiences
open it
but this is landru
open it marplon makes deep bow and the door opens outwards they enter the empty room
landru speaks here kirk and spock remove the robes and leave the staves propped by the open door
landru landru we are the archons we are the archons we ve come to speak we are the archons we want to talk to you the projection appears on the far wall
landru he comes
despite my efforts to save you you have invaded the body and you are causing great harm
we have no intention of causing harm
obliteration is necessary the infection is strong for the good of the body you must die it is great sorrow
we do not intend to die
all who saw you all who know of your presence here must be excised the memory of the body will be cleansed
listen to me
useless captain projection
yes mister spock let have look at the projector they both use their phasers to blast hole in the wall as expected there are nice clean big computer boxes in room beyond lights are flashing and blinking blinking and flashing
of course it had to be landru
machine this whole society is machine concept of perfection peace harmony
but no soul
am landru you have intruded
pull out its plug mister spock before they can press the buttons on their phasers there is high-pitched sound
your devices have been neutralised so it shall be with you am landru
landru died six thousand years ago
am landru am he all that he was am his experience his knowledge
but not his wisdom he may have programmed you but he could not have given you soul you are machine
your statement is irrelevant you will be obliterated the good of the body is the prime directive
the good of the body captain that the key
yes what is the good
am landru
landru is dead you are machine question has been put to you answer it
the good is the harmonious continuation of the body the good is peace tranquillity the good of the body is the directive
then put it to you that you have disobeyed the prime directive you are harmful to the body
the body is it exists it is healthy
the body is dying you are destroying it
do you ask question
what have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the body
insufficient data
without freedom of choice there is no creativity without creativity there is no life the body dies the fault is yours
are you aiding the body or are you destroying it
sounding very machine-like davros-like am not programmed to answer that question
landru guide us landru kirk draws his phaser
not necessary captain they have no guidance possibly for the first time in their lives
landru answer the question
peace order and tranquillity are maintained the body lives but reserve creativity to me
then the body dies creativity is necessary for the health of the body
this is impossible
is this truly landru
what left of him after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago
you must create the good that is the will of landru nothing else
but there is evil
then the evil must be destroyed that is the prime directive and you are the evil
think live
you are the evil the evil must be destroyed fulfill the prime directive smoke starts to rise from the base of the main computer bank
you
landru help me
are the evil fulfill the prime directive
help me help me help me help me fire breaks out and things go bang the machine dies now kirk and spock step briefly into the computer room
well marplon you re on your own now hope you re up to it to lawgivers and you can get rid of those robes if were you start look for another job kirk to enterprise come in
captain are you all right
what about the ship
the heat rays are gone captain and mister sulu back to normal
relieving you
excellent scotty stand by to beam up landing party let go and see how the others are doing marplon can finish up here captain log stardate 3158 the enterprise is preparing to leave beta three in star system one eleven sociologist lindstrom is remaining behind with party of experts who will help restore the planet culture to human form
marvellous
what
the late landru captain marvellous feat of engineering computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings
but only machine mister spock the original landru programmed it with all his knowledge but he couldn give it his wisdom his compassion his understanding his soul mister spock
predictably metaphysical prefer the concrete the graspable the provable
you make splendid computer mister spock
that is very kind of you captain
captain mister lindstrom from the surface
yes lindstrom
how it going half dozen domestic quarrels and two genuine knock-down drag-outs it may not be paradise but it certainly human
sounds most promising good luck
how often mankind has wished for world as peaceful and secure as the one landru provided
yes and we never got it just lucky guess progress report forward phaser
we re entering standard orbit nurse it won be much longer
understand you gave up career in bio-research to sign aboard starship
know he alive down there captain engineering controls
it been five years since his last message
roger very determined man he find way to live
beginning signals to surface sir
put it on all frequencies lieutenant
ship record banks show little we don already know about this planet captain gravity is one point one of earth atmosphere within safety limits
but the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees below zero
it may have been inhabited once but the sun in this system has been fading steadily for half million years now doctor korby often called the pasteur of archaeological medicine his translation of medical records from the orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation techniques
required reading at the academy mister spock ve always wanted to meet him do you think there any chance of him still being alive
ve tried all frequencies sir no return signal
keep trying
his last signal told about finding underground caverns
and since then two expeditions have failed to find him
ve run all frequencies second time there no repeating this is doctor roger korby do you read me enterprise this is doctor roger korby standing by captain log stardate 2712 signal from planet exo doctor roger korby has been located he and part of his expedition remaining alive due to the discovery of underground ruins ieft by the former inhabitants of this world
enterprise to korby we have your co-ordinates pin-pointed we re preparing to beam down party it may interest you that we have aboard this vessel alone just yourself we ve made discoveries of such nature they may require an extraordinary decision from you
that an unusual request
the man making it is doctor roger korby
you re certain you recognise his voice
have you ever been engaged mister spock yes it roger
agreed doctor however there will be two of us
hello roger
yes roger captain had no idea no hope darling are you all right
yes roger everything all right now
we re on our way doctor we ll be with you in moment enterprise out
energise
he said he be waiting
doctor korby doctor korby it possible we may have hit the wrong entry point kirk to enterprise
beam down two security men
some delay in meeting us probably nothing at all kirk out corridors could be quite deep getting here may have taken more time than he estimated don worry
thank you
rayburn maintain post here
yes sir
matthews we ll look for doctor korby accompany us
yes sir the trio go deeper into the tunnel complex until chapel slips at the edge of deep pit further on they come to bright light figure steps in front of it
is that you doctor korby
doctor brown it roger assistant brownie where roger man screams they dash back to the pit figure is creeping away unseen
be careful
is there path down there
there no hope captain it bottomless he must have slipped
any chance of projection or ledge
none captain unfortunate terribly unfortunate doctor korby was detained came as soon as could
not soon enough
brownie what is it
explain
don you recognise me
christine you look well my name is brown doctor korby assistant presume you are captain kirk he dead assure you come doctor korby will be waiting
you do know him well an old friend
suppose living here for five years
captain kirk to rayburn report
any problems there sir enterprise to have full security party standing by
yes sir lose contact or if he fails to hear from either of us he to beam the security party down immediately kirk out the figure creeps up on rayburn and attacks him
doctor korby has discovered that as their sun dimmed the inhabitants of this planet moved underground from an open environment to this dark world when you were student of his christine you must have often heard doctor korby remark how freedom of movement and choice produced the human spirit the culture of exo proved his theory when they moved from light to darkness they replaced freedom with mechanistic culture doctor korby has been able to uncover elements of this culture which will revolutionise the universe when freed from this cavernous environment
andrea you must be christine ve always thought how beautiful your name is and you must be captain kirk of the starship enterprise we appreciate you bringing roger fiancee to him
don remember doctor korby mentioning an andrea
but you are exactly as roger described you no wonder he missed you so
where is doctor korby
here captain ve been looking forward to sees chapel and they kiss
oh knew find you
everything all right now oh forgive me captain er roger korby
there no need to apologise sir and certainly no need to introduce yourself
the captain lost man in the caverns doctor
what how did it happen
the pit near the outer junction the edge must have given way
terribly sorry captain perhaps if been there know the passages so well
it wasn your fault kirk to rayburn report required to make security confirmation when call my ship if you list your personnel cargo requirements any special needs
captain much prefer
rayburn are you receiving
prefer you waited captain please till ve talked to you
ve lost contact with my guard required to call my ship
no communications captain holding weapon
roger
sorry if they should send down more people
roger that
he won be harmed promise you isn it possible there could be things here unknown to you so terribly important
sir one man is dead ve lost contact with the other
andrea
what are you doing
this is necessary captain you will understand andrea she reaches for kirk phaser but he grabs her to use as shield and aims it at brown instead while moving towards table to use as barrier instead of the girl
drop it he fires brown falls straight backwards and the big figure bursts in and lifts kirk off his feet chapel screams as she sees the hole in brown reveals electronic parts do you read
frequency open mister spock
spock here captain
we were becoming concerned captain your check-in was overdue and since we not heard from your security team forty eight hours doctor korby records and specimens will require careful packing
captain are you all right you sound tired
if you move or cry out ruk may injure you at least wait until we can talk fascinating discoveries all under control stand by for regular contact kirk out
this is not vain display captain scientist you obviously know my reputation trust me
yes know your reputation the whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for that why all this makes no sense
there so much you must learn before you make final judgment for example to ruk andrea
you see captain
that enough you are not to mock christine you will never harm her
or disobey an order from her
you will not disobey her orders satisfied captain kirk both love and trust now give me twenty four hours to convince you
doctor do need to be prisoner to be convinced
what would your first duty be upon return to your vessel report do you realise the number of discoveries lost because of superstition of ignorance of layman inability to comprehend
simple layman question doctor where is my other crewman alive dead
ruk was programmed to protect my experiments the logic of his machine mind saw danger to me
where is my other crewman
ruk destroyed them both totally against my wishes assure you
he an android like brown
more complex than brown much superior was left here by the old ones
ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here how many centuries even ruk doesn know with his help ith the records could find we built brown
you ve convinced me doctor you ve convinced me that you re dangerous makes run for it but ruk grabs him and throws him around
ruk no
do not understand why are you unhappy you are with roger again
where is captain kirk
you are concerned about the captain
yes am concerned
how can you love roger without trusting him why does it bother you when use the name roger
andrea it sufficient that it does disturb her you will call me doctor korby from now on andrea
yes doctor korby didn mean to eavesdrop darling as you can see captain kirk is fine he won be harmed the things at stake here simply make it necessary he doesn send report to his ship need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you now shall we start with andrea
yes let start with andrea
like doctor brown an android didn you know
remarkable isn she notice the the lifelike pigmentation the variation in skin tones the flesh the flesh has warmth there even pulse physical sensation
how convenient
christine you must realise an android like computer it does only what programme as trained scientist yourself you must realise that
given mechanical doctor brown mechanical geisha would be no more difficult
you think could love machine
did you
andrea incapable of that she simply obeys orders she has no meaning for me there no emotional bond andrea kiss captain kirk now strike him you see there no emotion in it no emotional involvement she simply responds to orders she totally logical computer thing is not woman now do you understand
if these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them then why did brown try to shoot me why did he kill two of my men there are many things don understand doctor
will answer all of your questions now
this is how you make an android kirk is naked on one side of circular table human-shaped blob on the other andrea the table starts turning he not being harmed promise
roger what happened to you when sat in your class you wouldn even dream of harming an insect or an animal their life was sacred to you then
christine if simply beamed up to their vessel with brown and the others have given them objects of curiosity beginnings of wild stories foolish theories ruk watch carefully the blob turns into kirk and the table is stopped choose christine which is your captain
don know they re exact honestly don know
synthetic organs are in place we merely synchronise them with kirk autonomic nervous system duplicating the rhythms of his body at the same time we duplicate the mental pattern now physical pattern complete we now make mental pattern ready for final synaptic fusion andrea stand by for cortex circuits the android will be so perfect it could even replace the captain the same memories the same attitudes the same abilities activate circuits
mind your own business mister spock sick of your half-breed interference do you hear mind your own business mister spock sick of your half-breed passes out the other one wakes up
complete
are you all right
as far as know
now meet an android
how do you do miss chapel
am now programmed to please you also is the food appealing
yes thank you
please sit captain
thank you more or less on parole understand
doctor korby suggested that you have lunch he thought you might have few things to talk about
captain
know know hate to be torn between commander and fiancÃ©e myself
no not torn puzzled worried
has he confided in you
nothing he hasn told you know it doesn make sense what he done may seem wrong but he is roger korby whatever he seems to be doing
unless something gone wrong with his mind
no you re forgetting how well know him he as sane as you or
nurse if gave you direct order to betray him
please don ask me to make that choice much rather you push me off the same precipice where matthews died oh can pushes plate away please go ahead and eat
androids don eat miss chapel
he even has your sense of humour
well there one difference between us hungry
the difference is your weakness captain not mine
one at time gentlemen captain
eating is pleasure sir unfortunately one you will never know
perhaps but will never starve sir
he an exact duplicate
in every detail
what about memory tell me about sam
george samuel kirk your brother only you call him sam
he saw me off on this mission
yes with his wife and three sons
he said he was being transferred to earth colony two research station
no captain he said he was continuing his research and that he wanted to be transferred to earth colony two
you might as well try to outthink calculating machine
obviously can but we do have some interesting differences
totally unimportant ones you may leave now kirk2 leaves you haven guessed the rest not even you christine what you saw was only machine only half of what could ve accomplished do you understand by continuing the process could ve transferred you your very consciousness into that android your soul if you wish all of you in android form human being can have practical immortality can you understand what offering mankind
programming different word but the same old promises made by genghis khan julius caesar hitler ferris maltuvis
can you understand that human converted to an android can be programmed for the better can you imagine how life could be improved if we could do away with jealousy greed hate
it can also be improved by eliminating love tenderness sentiment the other side of the coin doctor
no one need ever die again no disease no deformities why even fear can be programmed away replaced with joy offering you pracical heaven new paradise and all need is your help
all you wanted before was my understanding
need transportation to planet colony with proper raw materials sure there are several good possibilities among your next stops no diversion from your route want no suspicions aroused ll begin producing androids carefully selectively
yes yes no one need know only to frighten uninformed minds
they must be strongly infiltrated into society before the android existence is revealed want no wave of hysteria to destroy what is good and right you with me captain
you ve created your own kirk why do you need me
created him to impress you not to replace you
impressed doctor but not the way you think leaps up with cord he untied from the chair leg and loops it around korby throat stand back ruk ll kill him stay back goes through door releasing korby into ruk arms
ruk protect
roger ruk no runs after him
ruk stop doctor korby said you are to obey me ruk ruk ruk order you not to harm him kirk breaks off stalactite to use as club ruk hears the sound help you
christine is that you ruk sneaks up and they struggle ending up with kirk dangling from the edge of the pit after thinking about it ruk pulls him up to safety
captain
captain we finished ahead of schedule
doctor korby has considerable cargo to beam aboard ll have to go over our destination schedule with him
you re going back down with the command pack
mind your own business mister spock sick of your half-breed interference do you hear
yes very well captain
you look upset mister spock is everything all right up here
no problems here sir
good ll beam up shortly with doctor korby and party leaves
security spock here status of your landing party
have them meet me in the transporter room after the captain has beamed down
looked it over think you ll find planet midas five an excellent choice
small colony abundant raw materials you made good beginning captain
thank you felt quite at home on the enterprise
andrea kiss me she does then raises her arm to slap him he stops her and pulls her in for passionate embrace
no not programmed for you
what the matter andrea confused
no leaves ruk blocks kirk attempt to leave
emotion ruk you disapprove of miss chapel orders to save my life
to maintain your existence would be illogical
why can your memory banks solve simple equation like that what happened to the old ones ruk
so long ago
is it possible they built their machines too well gave them pride and desire to survive machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them
yes the old ones the ones who made us they grew fearful of us they began to turn us off
and isn it korby who creating the same danger to you all over again unlike you we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve
yes yes it had been so long ago had forgotten the old ones here the ones who made us yes yes it is still in my memory banks it became necessary to destroy them you are inconsistent you cannot be programmed you are inferior
and korby
you came from the outside you bring disorder here
the danger to you is korby
was programmed by korby cannot harm him
the old ones programmed you too but it became possible to destroy them
that was the equation seizes kirk existence survival must cancel out programming
that it ruk logic you can protect someone who trying to destroy you
ruk would like
you brought him among us you brought the inferior ones we had cleansed ourselves of them now you bring the evil back
ruk stop your programming fires phaser ruk vanishes had no choice
you were man with respect for all things alive how can explain the change in you if was to tell earth was in your hands to tell them what has become jumps korby and traps his arm in door the skin tears to reveal electronics
it still me christine roger in here you can imagine how it was was frozen dying my legs were gone was had only my brain between life and death this can be repaired easier than another man can set broken finger still the same as was before christine perhaps even better
are you roger
into comm unit andrea
there someone in the outer junction
spock he must ve got my message
but he ll never find us in this maze
ruk has been shut off
will kiss you
no
you you will not
it is illogical she disintegrates him
the same direct transfer all of me human rational and without flaw
he freed himself and destroyed sees kirk there destroyed him am not programmed for alarms listened to your instructions they were mis-stated
she killed the android korby the same way you killed ruk is this your perfect world your flawless beings killing off one another aren you doing exactly what you hate most in humans killing with no more concern than when you turn off light
not computer test me ask me to solve any equate transmit christine christine let me prove myself does this make such difference
don you see roger everything you ve done has proved it isn you
am roger korby
then prove it give me that phaser gun if there any human left in you give it to me
no you will never understand constructed perfect being tested it proved it proved it proved it hands phaser to kirk
andrea give me the weapon
no protect protect to korby to love you to to kiss you
no you cannot love you re not human
love you kiss korby reaches for trigger and disintegrates them both
in here spock
captain are you all right nurse where doctor korby
doctor korby was never here
thank you for letting me make the decision captain quite certain doing the right thing leaves
she staying with the ship something bothering you mister spock
frankly was rather dismayed by your use of the term half-breed captain you must admit it is an unsophisticated expression
ll remember that mister spock the next time find myself in similar situation steady as we go helm
that should make good specimen
holding pink animal with horn temperature starting to drop
yeah at night it gets down to hundred and twenty degrees below zero
that nippy
hey
what happened
fell off that bank sir cut my hand
let see it get back to the ship report to the sickbay
yes sir geological technician fisher ready to beam up
right locked onto you energise coadjutor engagement
what happened
took flop
onto what
don know some kind of yellow ore
magnetic decontaminate that uniform
yes sir ;eaves
that acted like burnout
just one moment captain it checks out okay now you better go get synchronic meter so we can double-check
yes sir
all right captain locked onto you kirk stumbles as he leaves the platform are you all right captain
yes all right just little dizzy
let me give you hand
can get through there nothing serious don leave the transporter room unattended
wilson will be right back sir both leave and another kirk materialises on the pad captain log stardate 1672 specimen-gathering mission on planet alpha 177 unknown to any of us during this time duplicate of me some strange alter ego had been created by the transporter malfunction
captain are you all right sir can give you hand sir captain officers check communication lines
thank you
it might profit you to let doctor mccoy give you the once-over
all right engineer ll have my engines looked to
ship manifests sir think they re in order now
thank you yeoman
ve checked
that all
yes sir leaves kirk to lie down on bed
you picked good day fisher business has been lousy what you do take fall on purpose so you could get little vacation
saurian brandy back to duty status fisher have no sympathy for clumsiness
no sir the hand much better sir leaves
what can do for you jim
grabbing him by the neck said give me the brandy leaves with bottle and goes to rand quarters
yeah
come in yes mister spock what is it
is there something can do for you captain
like what
well doctor mccoy seemed to think should check on you
that nice come on spock know that look what is it
well our good doctor said that you were acting like wild man demanded brandy
our good doctor been putting you on again
hmm well in that case if you ll excuse the intrusion captain ll get back to my work
ll tell him you were properly annoyed
captain
what is it scotty
transporter breakdown continue circuit testing we beamed up this animal and well look for yourself it in this specimen case opens lid to reveal angry pink animal
yes
few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter that duplicate appeared except it not duplicate it an opposite two of the same animal but different one gentle this one mean and fierce that some kind of savage ferocious opposite captain we don dare send mister sulu and the landing party up if this should happen to man
oh my
oh captain you startled me is there something that you can help you captain
jim will do here janice
oh
you re too beautiful to ignore too much woman we ve both been pretending too long grabs her stop pretending let stop pretending come here janice don fight me don fight me janice kisses her
captain
just minute janice just minute forces her onto the floor she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as fisher is passing by
call mister spock call mister spock
geological technician fisher deck twelve section kirk grabs him and hits him hard
me my yeoman said that ve been resting here since you left me alone mister spock
doctor mccoy reports that you demanded this brandy in sickbay and left with it found this bottle in yeoman rand quarters
not true haven been to the sickbay let find out what going on
sickbay just missing the other kirk nursing grazed knuckles who goes into his quarters
then he kissed me and he said that we that he was the captain and he could order me didn know what to do when you mentioned the feelings we been hiding and you started talking about us
us
well he is the captain couldn just you started hurting me had to fight you and scratch your face
yeoman look at me look at me look at my face are there any scratches
was sure scratched you was frightened maybe
yeoman was in my room it wasn me
sir fisher saw you too
fisher saw
if it hadn been can understand don want to get you into trouble wouldn have even mentioned it
it wasn me
it was you sir
do you know what you re saying
yes know what saying
back to that bed bucko come on let go
you can go now yeoman rand leaves there only one logical answer we have an impostor aboard captain log stardate 1672 on the planet surface temperatures are beginning to drop our landing party there in growing jeopardy due to the malfunction of the ship transporter an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists
how did all this happen
don know sir but when fisher came up his suit was covered with soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties it may have caused an overload can tell not yet
does the transporter work at all
yes sir but we don dare bring up the landing party it might be duplicated like this animal
how long will it take you to find the trouble
can say sir
we just can leave those four men down there it getting dark they ll die the surface temperature of that planet goes down to hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night
we re doing everything we can sir
yes know scotty
about your double captain
yes er yes we ll have to find him search parties mister spock organise search parties
we can take chance on killing it we have no previous experience no way of knowing what would happen to you
yes that right we don know but the men have to be armed the men are to be armed with their phasers locked repeat locked on setting number one there can be any chance of him being killed he to be taken without if the men are forced to fire he can be killed
how shall we explain it to them captain the search parties are to capture you
tell them
the search parties captain
yes ll make an announcement to the entire crew tell them what happened it good crew they deserve to know
captain no disrespect intended but you must surely realise you can announce the full truth to the crew you re the captain of this ship you haven the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew you can afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect if you do they lose faith and you lose command
yes do know that mister spock what don know is why forgot that just now mister spock if you see me slipping again your orders your orders are to tell me
understood captain captain log stardate 1673 something has happened to me somehow in being duplicated have lost my strength of will decisions are becoming more and more difficult impostor aboard the ship man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me this man is dangerous utmost caution is to be observed all crew members are to arm themselves the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face repeat the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face
section chiefs assign personnel to the search all search parties
something
about the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked
oh yes yes all hand phasers must be set on base cycle stunning force minimum force repeat the imposter
captain kirk
captain kirk captain kirk captain kirk captain kirk goes to mirror covers scratches with makeup opens door wilson
sir
wilson give me your phaser
yes sir
how have you been
fine sir kirk grabs and hits him
it already twenty degrees below zero can exactly
isn there any way we can help them
thermal heaters were transported down they duplicated they won operate
then we ve got to get those men up
spock here captain cabin he says the impostor attacked him called him by name took his hand phaser
acknowledged continue the search
we ve got to find him before he but how
apparently this double however different in temperament has your knowledge of the ship its crew its devices this being the case perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move knowing how the ship is laid out where would you go to elude mass search
the lower levels the engineering deck
set and locked on base cycle to stun not to kill what about your phaser captain don you think we ought to get some help captain
no don want anyone else to see the
captain you ordered me to tell you
mister spock if to be the captain ve got to act like one they split up to search and kirk comes face to face with himself
you can hurt me you can kill me you can don you understand part of you you need me need you
don need you spock neck-pinches him and his phaser fire hits panel instead
he ll be regaining consciousness soon and not knowing what his physical state is don think dare give him tranquilizer of any kind think we better bind him
yes yes all right what the matter with me
judging from my observations captain you re rapidly losing the power of decision
you have point spock
yes always doctor we have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind or to examine in earth terms the roles of good and evil in man his negative side which you call hostility lust violence and his positive side which earth people express as compassion love tenderness
it the captain guts you re analysing are you of that spock
yes and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader we see indications that it his negative side which makes him strong that his evil side if you will properly controlled and disciplined is vital to his strength your negative side removed from you the power of command begins to elude you
what is your point mister spock
if your power of command continues to weaken you ll soon be unable to function as captain you must be prepared for that
you have your intellect jim you can fight with that
for how long
if seem insensitive to what you re going through captain understand it the way am
kirk here deck
ve found new trouble with the transporter the casing has wide gap ripped in it the phaser damage the main circuits control circuit is gone altogether
can you give us status report captain temperature still dropping now forty one degrees below zero
do you think you might be able to find long rope somewhere and lower us down pot of hot coffee
ll see what we can do
engineering deck kirk here
that unit scotty status report
how bad is it captain log stardate 1673 transporter still inoperable my negative self is under restraint in sickbay my own indecisiveness growing my force of will steadily weakening on the planet condition critical surface temperature is seventy five degrees below zero still dropping
using phaser to heat rocks think we ought to give room service another call that coffee taking too long enterprise this is sulu
kirk here mister sulu
gave everybody the afternoon off watching the store
oh lovely except that the frost is building up we re using hand phasers to heat the rocks one phaser quit on us three still operating any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here
this is spock mister sulu you ll have to hold on little longer there no other way survival procedures mister sulu other kirk is screaming
what happened
apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process fact failed to consider
he not dying
yes he is
help me
how can he die can survive without him
don know jim
don be afraid here my hand hold on you don have to be afraid won let go hold on you won be afraid if you use your mind and think think you can do it that it
jim he is back jim you can use that brandy now in fact ll join you
have to take him back inside myself can survive without him don want him back he like an animal thoughtless brutal animal and yet it me me
jim you re no different than anyone else we all have our darker side we need it it half of what we are it not really ugly it human
human
yes human lot of what he is makes you the man you are god forbid should have to agree with spock but he was right without the negative side you wouldn be the captain you couldn be and you know it your strength of command lies mostly in him
what do have
you have the goodness
not enough have ship to command
the intelligence the logic it appears your half has most of that and perhaps that where man essential courage comes from for you see he was afraid and you weren
kirk here think we may have found an answer
coming
what is it
we ve found way to get the transporter working sir
we ve attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference tied directly into the impulse engines there shouldn be more than five point variation in the velocity balance suggest we send the animal through captain
yes yes go ahead
opening box with angry animal in it ll grab him by the scruff of the neck and hold him as long as can
don hurt him
it painless and quick the animal will be unconscious for only few minutes sedates it
if this doesn work don know what will
energise reverse
the shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him
he dead jim captain log stardate 1673 entry made by second officer spock captain kirk retains command of this vessel but his force of will rapidly fading condition of landing party critical transporter unit still under repair
autopsy in-depth hurry don know animal could have died of some kind of shock
for once agree with you
said could have mister spock we won know until we get full post-mortem
no autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified confused it was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again thus shock induced by blind terror
yes yes that sounds likely
it couldn understand you can you have your intelligence controlling your fear
get the transporter room ready
could be if maybe all guesswork so far just theory jim why don you give me chance to do an autopsy and let spock check the transporter circuits again
that sounds sounds reasonable we should double-check everything
aren you forgetting something captain
no don think ve for
your men on the planet surface how much time do they have left
yes that right the men we have to take the chance bones their lives
suppose it wasn shock jim suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction then you die they die anyway jim you can risk your life on theory
being split in two halves is no theory with me doctor have human half you see as well as an alien half submerged constantly at war with each other personal experience doctor survive it because my intelligence wins over both makes them live together your intelligence would enable you to survive as well
help me somebody make the decision
are you relinquishing your command captain
no no not
well then we can help you jim the decision is yours
mister spock ready the transporter room bones continue the autopsy
kirk here
captain k-kirk sulu here one hundred seventeen below can last much longer indicator think the cold penetrating communicator two men unconscious no time no can wait no time
mister sulu mister sulu can wait can let them die
what are you going to do
go through the transporter both of us
there nothing can do to stop you
it what have to do it what have to do what we have to do
won fight you anymore oh feel so weak ll be glad when this is over grabs kirk and knocks him out
janice hello
captain
yeoman owe you an explanation
no
yes do the transporter malfunctioned divided me created duplicate the animal part of me came to your cabin he even scratched me to make us look more alike like the chance to explain it to you you don mind if come to your cabin later
no sir
enters turbolift bridge
no word from mister sulu sir
prepare to leave orbit mister farrell well
captain
gave you an order mister farrell
but what about
they can be saved prepare to leave orbit
yes sir
captain thought the plan
ve changed my mind man your station mister spock mccoy enters with another kirk identically dressed grab him he the impostor
no
mccoy he fooled you
he the one in the captain chair attacked him
mister spock you know who am you know what that is
mister spock which one what do we do
we ll let the captain handle this
the captain isn that obvious look at his face remember the scratches look how he tried to hide them he wants you to think that he captain kirk you know who am
yes know
you want to kill me don you farrell james grab him he ll destroy the ship the captain don you understand captain of the ship starts attacking the crew the captain this is my ship my ship it mine ll kill you
can half man live
take another step you ll die
then we ll both die
please don want to don make me don make me kirk takes phaser off him don want to go back please want to live
you will both of us
want to live
you ll have to hold on to him captain
mister spock
captain
if this doesn work
understood captain
mister spock
ready beams them out
well mister spock one figure is beamed back jim
get those men aboard fast
right away captain
as the party is wheeled away severe exposure and frostbite but think they ll make it how do you feel jim
how ve seen part of myself no man should ever see
status report green
all sections report ready sir
good thank you mister spock from both of us
shall pass that on to the crew sir
the impostor back where he belongs let forget him
captain the impostor told me what happened who he really was and just like to say that well sir what like is
thank you yeoman
the er impostor had some interesting qualities wouldn you say yeoman
this is the captain speaking navigator set in course correction helmsman steady as she goes enterprise is orbiting very green planet and young female yeoman is getting signature from the captain
anything from the landing party
they should be sending up report momentarily captain kirk stretches and groans something wrong
kink in my back behind his back the yeoman starts to massage it that it little higher please push push hard dig it in there mister spock steps forward and kirk realises who is massaging his lower back
thank you yeoman that sufficient
you need sleep captain if it not out of line
have enough of that from doctor mccoy yeoman thank you
doctor mccoy is correct captain after what this ship has been through in the last three months there is not crewman aboard who is not in need of rest myself excepted of course
have doctor mccoy report channeled to my quarters lieutenant
aye aye captain
beautiful beautiful no animals no people no worries just what the doctor ordered right doctor
couldn have prescribed better we are one weary ship
do you think the captain will authorise shore leave here
depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties you know you have to see this place to believe it it like something out of alice in wonderland the captain has to come down
he like it
he needs it you ve got your problems ve got mine he got ours plus his plus four hundred and thirty other people where are you going
to get some cell-structure records blade of grass bush tree flower petal with these we can tell the whole planet biology as sulu crouches down behind some pampas grass mccoy turns and looks straight at white rabbit in check jacket yellow waistcoat and looking at gold pocket-watch
oh my paws and whiskers ll be late it heads off down hole then young girl comes running up wearing blue dress with white apron
excuse me sir have you seen rather large white rabbit with yellow waistcoat and white gloves here about wordlessly mccoy points in the direction the rabbit went the girl curtseys nicely
thank you very much she runs off after the rabbit
sulu
what is it what the matter
did you see them
see what don see anything what is it doc the captain is dictating his log in the presence of yeoman tonia barrows
captain log stardate 3025 er point we are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the omicron delta region planet remarkably like earth or how we remember earth to be park-like beautiful green flowers trees green lawn quiet and restful almost too good to be true
sir don see your name in any of the shore parties
may be tired yeoman but not falling apart dismissed
aye aye sir she leaves and spock enters
mister spock we re beaming down the starboard section first which section would you like to go with
not necessary in my case captain on my planet to rest is to rest to cease using energy to me it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it intercom whistles
kirk here
yes open channel uhura
captain are you beaming down
hadn planned to bones why
well either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated or must report myself unfit for duty
explain
on this supposedly uninhabited planet just saw large rabbit claim that he was late
that pretty good got one for you the rabbit was followed by little blonde girl right
as matter of fact yes hedge
all right doctor ll take your report under consideration captain out that mccoy pill with little mystery sugar-coating he wants to get me down there afraid won swallow it
very well captain something did come to discuss
yes mister spock what is it
picked this up from doctor mccoy log we have crewmember aboard who showing signs of stress and fatigue reaction time down nine to twelve percent associational reading norm minus three
that much too low rating
he becoming irritable and quarrelsome yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation now he has that right but we ve found
crewman right ends where the safety of the ship begins that man will go shore on my orders what his name
james kirk enjoy yourself captain it an interesting planet you ll find it quite pleasant very much like your earth an establishing shot of landscape of any kind only peace sunshine and good air you ll have no problems but as these words are spoken rock raises itself to reveal classic western-style six shooter gun elsewhere man and woman are taking scans of the vegetation
the woman does it always have to be work with you there so much loveliness
you won find all this so lovely if our report for the captain isn ready when he asks for it which shouldn be long kirk and barrows beam down
rodriguez teller everything all right
yes sir we ve completed the specimen survey
good that should be sufficient beam it up to mister spock when you re ready and start enjoying yourselves
thank you sir and sir think you ll find doctor mccoy and mister sulu that way
thank you walking along
restful after what we ve been through it hard to believe place this beautiful exists
it is beautiful so lovely and restful mean affirmative captain
mccoy mccoy
over here over here they meet up by the lake
bones know any good rabbit jokes lately
as matter of fact do but this is not one of them look at this pair of large tracks in the soil saw what saw or maybe hallucinated it but want you to take look and tell me what you think about it
footprints could be rabbit it would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks what about mister sulu will he confirm what you saw
negative he was examining the flora at the time
bridge this is the captain
where is mister sulu
collecting specimens
has the first shore party beamed down yet
negative captain they re just about to start
get this message to all shore parties stand by no one is to leave the ship
aye aye sir
you re cancelling the shore leave on account of this jim
you re the doctor doctor can you explain this
well no
neither can admit it looks harmless it probably is harmless but before bring my people down here want proof it harmless they hear gunshot kirk draws his phaser and they head off in the direction of the shot more are fired they find sulu target practising
what do you think you re doing
target shooting captain isn it beauty haven got anything like this in my collection
where did you get it mister sulu
found it know it crazy coincidence but ve always wanted one like this found it lying right over there an old-time police special and in beautiful condition hasn been one like this made in couple of centuries
holding out his hand for the offending weapon mister sulu
handing it over it fires lead pellets propelled by expanding gases from chemical explosion
ll hang on to it the fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy
doctor mccoy rabbit sir he must have gone through here
are you sure our instruments didn show any animal life on this planet
absolutely no birds no mammals no insects nothing certain our readings weren off
like to believe this is an elaborate gag but yeoman barrows you accompany mister sulu find out where those tracks came from doctor you come with me back to the glade like another look at that area as they head back an aerial comes up in front of our point of view and follows them
this is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave
well it could have been worse
how
you could have seen the rabbit
what the matter bones you getting persecution complex
well yeah beginning to feel little bit picked on if that what you mean
know the feeling very well had it at the academy an upper classman there one practical joke after another and always on me my own personal devil guy by the name of finnegan
and you being the very serious young
serious ll make confession bones was absolutely grim which delighted finnegan no end he the kind of guy to put bowl of cold soup in your bed or bucket of water propped on half-open door you never knew where he strike next more tracks looks like your rabbit came from over there
girl footprints the young blonde girl saw chasing it
yes you follow the rabbit ll backtrack the girl ll meet you around the other side of the hill
good ve got personal grudge against that rabbit jim they split up and then suddenly there young man leaning against tree trunk
in dreadful cod-irish accent jim
finnegan can believe it
you never know when going to strike huh jim hits him on the jaw how this come on come on it me finnegan all right jimmy boy maniacal laughter go ahead lay one on me that what you always wanted isn it come on come on
all right let try that one again go he just lays hands on finnegan for good fight when they hear screams kirk runs off to investigate
go any excuse jim baby run away run away run away along the path he meets mccoy
what was it
yeoman barrows they arrive on the scene to find tonia disheveled her uniform torn hugging tree
what happened
don know mean do know was following the tracks and there he was
who was
him
barrows give me report
he had cloak sir and dagger with jewels on it
are you sure you re not imagining all this
captain know it sounds incredible but did not imagine it any more than imagined he did this
sounds like don juan
yes yes it was so sort of story book walking around here and was thinking all girl needs is don juan just day dreaming the way you would about someone you like to meet
mister sulu was with you where is he now
he ran after him
stay with her doctor he heads off in the direction she indicates
mister sulu sulu an aerial comes up from rock and monitors him as he runs along the path
mister sulu sulu the captain runs across barren piece of ground towards rocky outcrop which suddenly gains palms and banana plants when he gets there
sulu he picks an orange flower and becomes wistful and there she is blonde and lovely her dress half white half black and roses
ruth ruth
jim darling it is me it is ruth she kisses him captain log stardate 3025 investigation of this increasingly unusual planet continues and we are seeing things that cannot possibly exist yet they are undeniably real
into communicator mccoy do you read me ruth ruth how can it be you how could you possibly be here you haven aged it been fifteen years
it doesn matter none of that matters his communicator beeps
kirk here
what
no but sure he all right
yes fine
yes mister rodriguez of them
don you like birds mister rodriguez kirk; then offhand say our instruments are defective there are indeed life-forms on this planet
mister rodriguez have the search parties rendezvous at the glade like some answers to all this
you have to go
don want to
you ll see me again if you want to
you haven told me you haven told me
do what you have to do and ll be waiting
ruth communicator beeps
kirk here
yes mister spock
getting strange readings from the planet surface captain some sort of power field down there
specify and increasing beginning to affect our communications
can you pinpoint the source
could be coming from beneath the planet surface patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity
keep me posted mister spock we ll continue our investigation down here captain out he walks off meanwhile back at the tree where tonia met don juan something is monitoring them the couple go walking arm in arm through the tropical plants
feeling better
little but wouldn want to be alone here
it beautiful place little strange ll admit
that just it it almost too beautiful was thinking even before my tunic was torn that in place like this girl should be oh let see now girl should be dressed like fairy-tale princess with lots of floaty stuff and tall hat with veil
see what you mean but then you have whole armies of don juans to fight off and me too
is that promise doctor he takes her hands in his and they gaze into each others eyes for long second then she spots her dream clothing hanging on some shrubs
oh doctor they re lovely look at me doctor lady to be protected and fought for princess of the blood royale
you are all of those things and many more they ll look even lovelier with you wearing them
doctor afraid
now look don know how or why but the dress is here like to see you in it why don you put it on
all right but you stay right there don peek
my dear girl am doctor when peek it in the line of duty he turns his back on her and his communicator beeps
mccoy here can read you very well is this rodriguez read you well either captain orders rendezvous at that glade where he first found you
right what the devil wrong with communications esteban esteban but esteban and teller have problems of their own tiger has them trapped
doctor doctor doctor mccoy the tiger gets bored and leaves tonia emerges from her changing room looking lovely and happy in her disney fantasy creation spock want some answers
first there was mccoy alice in wonderland where there was supposedly no animal life and sulu gun where there no refined metal detected rodriguez birds and then my well the two people saw
any chance these could be hallucinations
one hallucination flattened me with clout on the jaw
that sounds like painful reality
yes
your signal is very weak can you turn up your gain
captain shall beam down an armed party
negative our people here are armed with phasers besides there yet to be any real danger he sees geese flying overhead captain out sulu walks along by cliff face hatch opens in the ground and out comes samurai to attack him sulu phaser doesn work and he is forced to dodge the long sharp sword
mccoy mccoy do you read me kirk to mccoy come in sulu comes running over the rocks towards him
captain take cover there samurai after me
what
mean there was no one is chasing him now captain you ve got to believe me
do ve met some interesting personalities myself have you seen any of the others while ve been gone
got call few minutes ago rodriguez said you were rendezvousing back at the glade
hope he got through to everybody communications are almost out
that not all so my phaser
yeah we better get to the glade
yes sir sound of transporter beam look someone beaming down from the bridge
trying to something obstructing it finally the familiar shape fully materialises mister spock my orders were no one was to leave the ship
necessary captain unable to contact you by communicator and the transporter is useless to us now as told you before there an unusual power field down here it soaking up all the energy at the source calculated the rate of its growth and reasoned that just might be able to transport one more person
good we can use your help
we re stranded down here captain
until we can find out what this is all about
there no one here
this is where the captain said to rendezvous makes tonia stand with her back to tree swear heard someone moving around
don talk like that
princess shouldn be afraid not with brave knight to protect her the trio hear the snarl of big cat
that way spread out let find it knight in armour on black horse has appeared and is coming towards them
these things cannot be real hallucinations can harm us go back to where you were kirk and spock arrive on the scene the knight lowers his lance charges and runs mccoy through tonia screams spock draws his phaser and kirk the gun he confiscated from sulu he shoots the knight from his horse then they run to mccoy
he dead captain log supplemental all contact with the enterprise has been lost we re trapped here our ship surgeon my personal friend is dead we re certain now that whatever we re facing is terribly real
it my fault it never would have happened it my fault
no
it is it is to blame
yeoman we re in trouble need every crewman alert and thinking
aye aye sir
at the knight body captain captain kirk goes over
you better have look at this sir the knight is plastic dummy don understand
neither do mister sulu but before we leave this planet will
it like dummy captain it couldn be alive
tricorder
still operating sir
mister spock spock and sulu swap places handing over the tricorder what do you make of that
this is not human skin tissue captain it more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs much finer of course
want an exact judgment mister spock
this is definitely mechanical contrivance it has the same basic cell structure as the plants here even the trees the grass
are you saying this is plant mister spock
saying that these are all multicellular castings the plants the animals the people they re all being manufactured
by who and why and why these particular things
all we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing just as pleasant or just as deadly there buzzing sound in the air and plane flies overhead
what is it
of all the crazy things remember what was telling you while ago about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used that one of them
can it hurt us
not unless it makes strafing run
what
the way they used to attack people on the ground the plane descends come on they run along the path as second plane joins the first straight into clump of trees angela falls to the ground having hit the tree
angela everyone has been watching the air show then sulu notices
captain
mccoy body
he gone dragged off
the black knight too
spock
at this point captain my analysis may not sound very scientific
mccoy death is scientific fact
there is one slight possibility very slim but nevertheless captain what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described
was was thinking about the academy my days
hey jim baby see you brought out reinforcements ha well waiting for you jimmy boy
finnegan finnegan what been happening to my people finnegan laughs and runs off
take sulu find mccoy body this man is my problem
captain wait
that an order mister spock he runs off after finnegan
here am run
jim find me can you see me come and get me here am come on you never could find your head with both hands like it used to be jimmy remember finally kirk catches up to him because he lounging on ledge hey jim
want some answers
coming up he jumps on kirk and they have fight finnegan knocks kirk down
get up get up get up always fight fair don you true officer and gentleman you you stupid underclassman ve got the edge still twenty years old look at you you re an old man the fight resumes and kirk punches finnegan till he falls down rocky slope and ends up writhing in pain
can move me leg can feel me leg my back is broken you ve broken me back
can you feel that he gets kicked to the ground
can you feel that now kirk passes out sleep sweet jimmy boy sleep as long as you like sleep forever jim boy forever and forever little later kirk regains consciousness
won you ever learn jim boy you never could take me you know
finnegan one thing
sure name it
answers
earn them he throws dirt in kirk face and the exchange of punches resumes until they re both too tired to continue
not bad kind of makes up for things huh jim
lot of things what been happening to my people
never answer questions from plebes jimmy boy
not plebe this is today fifteen years later what are you doing here
being exactly what you expect me to be jimmy boy kirk lands the final haymaker that knocks finnegan out cold
did you enjoy it captain
yes enjoyed it after all these years realisation dawns did enjoy it the one thing wanted to do after all these years was to beat the tar out of finnegan
which supports theory ve been formulating
that we re all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment
yes somehow our thoughts are read these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us
dangerous if we happen to be thinking about
yes we must all control our thoughts
difficult
the force field we encountered is obviously underground manufacturing these things passages lead to the surface just for example when rodriguez thought of tiger
spock the tiger is behind them the chain around it neck tethering it to the spot clearly visible
we ve got to get back to the landing party and warn them they start to run back to the glade the aircraft strafe them kirk elbows the samurai out of his way tonia has changed back into her uniform when don juan sneaks up behind her and grabs her warding off sulu and rodriquez with his sword
sulu rodriguez barrows front and centre don juan runs off
sir
don ask any questions sulu face front everyone don talk don breathe don think you re at attention concentrate on that and only that concentrate
captain smiling grey-haired man in long green robe walks up to kirk
who are you
the caretaker of this place captain kirk
you know my name
but of course lieutenant rodriguez lieutenant sulu yeoman barrows and mister spock we ve just discovered you don understand all this these experiences were intended to amuse you
amuse that your word for what we ve been through
but none of this is permanent here you have to only imagine your fondest wishes either old ones you wish to relive or new ones anything at all battle fear love triumph anything that pleases you can be made to happen
the term is amusement park
of course
an old earth name for place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things
this entire planet was constructed for our race of people to come and play
play as advanced as you obviously are and you still play
yes play mister sulu the more complex the mind the greater the need for the simplicity of play
exactly captain how very perceptive of you
but that still doesn explain the death of my ship surgeon
possibly because no one has died jim strolls in with lovely girl on each arm was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs it amazing they ve got factory complex down there you wouldn believe they can build or do anything immediately
not amused and how do you explain them
oh them well er was thinking about little cabaret know on rigel two and er there were these two girls in the chorus line and well here they are well after all am on shore leave
and so am
oh yes so you are well girls suppose you can turn something up the cabaret girls go to sulu and spock
we regret that some of you ve been made uncomfortable
you say your people built all this who are you what planet are you from
my impression is that your race is not yet ready to understand us captain
tend to agree communicator beeps
kirk here come back in do you require assistance
no everything is in order lieutenant stand by
however
if you would use the proper caution this amusement planet of ours could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves if you wish
it what the doctor ordered jim
lieutenant
commence transporting shore leave parties tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they ve ever had kirk out
handing the girl over to sulu captain ll go back aboard ship and take over with all due respect to the young lady ve already had as much shore leave as care for
no mister spock ll go you then he sees ruth walking towards the group on the other hand ll stay for day or two
did you enjoy your rest gentlemen
yes we did mister spock think we did
indeed we did mister spock
most illogical
ahead warp factor one mister sulu captain log our position orbiting psi 2000 an ancient world now frozen wasteland about to rip apart in its death throes our mission pick up scientific party below observe the disintegration of the planet
check out the life-support systems
right sir all life systems were off sir
someone strangled this woman tormolen the other four are back there
dead
right sir
engineer at his post tormolen he frozen there like he didn care
the rest
well better look for yourself mister spock one man was taking shower fully clothed they split up he takes off his glove to scratch his nose then puts it on the console something orange jumps onto his skin feeling the cold he puts the glove back on
be certain we expose ourselves to nothing spock here do you read enterprise
all station personnel are dead
unknown captain it like nothing we ve dealt with before
stardate 1704 the science party we were to have picked up has been found dead life support systems had been turned off station personnel frozen to death conditions highly unusual meanwhile we remain in orbit to complete our mission close scientific measurement of the break-up of this planet
you received my signal mister scott
yes sir decontaminate
captain here
spock and tormolen aboard sir decontamination
better have medicine look them over too tell mister spock ll meet him there in ten minutes kirk out
you re fine joe up and out of there mister spock your pulse is two hundred and forty two your blood pressure is practically nonexistent assuming you call that green stuff in your veins blood
the readings are perfectly normal for me doctor thank you and as for my anatomy being different from yours am delighted captain
how are they
they re fine jim
terrible captain it was terrible they were just sitting like they didn care whatever was happening they didn care keep wondering
you keep wondering if man was meant to be out here you keep wondering you keep signing on any guesses mister spock any idea of what happened down there
wish could say captain the circumstances were quite bizarre however our record tapes may show us something
six dead six people dead
you better get some rest
yes sir
set up those tapes mister spock we ll see if the answers are there leaves with spock
the lab status report doctor
oh thank you christine
next tape please
spectro-analysis tape sir
thank you
almost as though they were irrational drugged an engineer sitting there apparently oblivious to everything woman strangled crewman with phaser pistol in his hand
he used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery
and fully clothed man frozen to death in shower if the image wasn so ugly it would be laughable not even theory gentlemen
definitely not drugs or intoxication the bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively
it could be some form of space madness we ve never heard of but it would have to be caused by something our spectro-readings showed no contamination no unusual elements present
or at least none your tricorders could register
instruments register only those things they re designed to register space still contains infinite unknowns
earth science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet to do this we need the enterprise in critically tight orbit question could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew
we will need top efficiency captain it ll be tricky orbit when the planet begins to go there may be drastic changes in gravity mass magnetic field
the purpose of briefing gentlemen is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience in critical orbit there no time for surprise
unless you people on the bridge start taking showers with your clothes on my engines can pull us out of anything we ll be warping out of orbit within half second of getting your command
kirk here field change in mass also sir
it beginning unusually rapid shifts
on our way lieutenant ll hold you to that half second scotty
foil it rapier thin sword
all right so what do you do with it
what do you mean what do you do with it
self-defence mayhem shish kebab
you practice
for what
hi joey
last week it was botany he was trying to get me interested in was supposed to be collecting leaves plant specimens
your attitude is all wrong fencing tones the muscle sharpens the eye improves the posture you tell him joey explain to him hey joey you feeling all right
get off me you don rank me and you don have pointed ears so just get off my neck
what with him
nothing to the bridge acknowledge
you sure you re all right now joe we ve got to leave
we re all bunch of hypocrites sticking our noses into something that we ve got no business what are we doing out here anyway
take it easy joe
we bring pain and trouble with us leave men and women stuck out on freezing planets until they die what are we doing out here in space good what good we re polluting it destroying it we ve got no business being out here no business
take it easy joe
now calm down
if man was supposed to fly he have wings if he was supposed to be out in space he wouldn need air to breathe wouldn need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death
hey joey put the knife down huh
you re all steamed up joe
we don belong here it not ours not ours destroying and watching we don belong don belong six people died down there why do deserve to live
what are you doing joe
hey joey put the knife down grabs his arm don be fool
let go
you re just getting in sweat about three men struggle let me have the knife
joey don be fool
let me go
joey give me the knife they fall to the floor tormolen gets stabbed in the stomach emergency rec room area three nine we need medics captain log supplemental our orbit tightening our need for efficiency critical but unknown to us totally new and unusual disease has been brought aboard
relative gravity increasing sir
compensate mister riley
yes sir
magnetic field continuing to shift sir planet continuing to shrink in mass
mister spock
all scanning stations manned all recorders functioning captain
orbit steady now sir
obviously this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected valuable study we may be seeing earth distant future before its sun went dark this planet was remarkably similar to yours
helm answering nicely captain
good
communications status captain
tormolen record
psychiatric file personality quotients
was he trying to kill himself
it doubtful he meant to he was confused self-tortured
doesn sound like the man know
his capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high what puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force
his breathing rate is dropping doctor
compensate with the respirator stand by to close closing
what is it
relative gravity increase sir like the planet reached out and yanked at us
compensate adjusts riley controls compensate
orbit steady now sir may be little nervous guess
this shouldn be happening this man should be getting stronger you sure the respirator functioning properly
yes doctor
why is this man dying hypo
he dead doctor
the wounds were not that severe
uhura monitor communications tell mccoy ll be there when can
yes sir
planet breakup is imminent captain shrinking in size at an increasing rate as the planet continues to shrink in size its surface moves away from us
forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it
exactly we must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change
engine room from bridge
tie into the helm scotty if we should call for power we ll want it fast
rate of compaction seems constant
then ll go see what the good doctor wants keep me informed of any change mister spock
acknowledged
don know if it this planet or what happened with joe sweating like bridegroom
yeah me too
hey why don you come down to the gym with me kevin lad
now
why not light workout will take the edge off
sulu what about hey sulu don be fool
intestinal damage wasn that severe got to him in plenty of time that man should still be alive the only reason he died jim is he didn want to live he gave up
that supposition doctor not fact
well that may be maybe ve lost patients before but not like that not joe kind that kind of man doesn give up
coincidence maybe
you mean that joe was down on the planet surface and you re gonna ask me if it connected
that exactly what was going to ask
jim he was decontaminated he been medically checked we ve run every test we know for everything we know
that not good enough
well we re doing everything that possible
bones want the impossible checked out too
why isn mister sulu at this station
magnetic pull compensated for sir orbit steady
take over here rand male not janice
yes sir
you haven answered my question where is mister sulu
have no fear riley here one irishman is worth ten thousand of you
you re relieved mister riley lieutenant uhura take over this station
yes sir
now that what like let the women work too universal suffrage
report to sickbay mister riley
sickbay exactly where was heading sir
security mister riley is headed for sickbay see to it he arrives captain kirk to the bridge
where joe
well
he died didn he
yes
you know something you have such lovely eyes pretty lady touches her face
know he was friend of yours this must be terrible shock
you know what joe mistake was he wasn born an irishman
brandishing foil richelieu beware stand no farther no escape for you you either leave this bois bloodied or with my blood on your swords cowards
lieutenant brent relieve miss uhura
yes sir
what were their symptoms
nonviolent at this stage slightly disoriented riley seemed rather pleased with himself as if he were
irrational or drugged
precisely
security lieutenant uhura
yes sir
both sulu and riley locate and confine want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked
sir level two corridor three reports disturbance mister sulu chasing crewmen with sword
put security on it
fascinating pattern is developing first tormolen hidden personality traits being forced to the surface then riley who fancies himself descendant of irish kings and now sulu who is at heart swashbuckler out of your 18th century
present condition of psi 2000
gravity pull increasing we ve shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position
helmsman stabilise position
helm is not answering to control
warp us out of here
no response from engines sir
impulse power then blast us out of this orbit
impulse engines also dead sir
engine room we need power
mister scott acknowledge our controls are dead take her
richelieu at last
sulu put that discovers that the point is sharp put that thing away
for honour queen and france lunges
sulu
ah
sulu give me that
ll protect you fair maiden
sorry neither
foul richelieu distracted by uhura escape kirk is able to grab sulu and spock does neck-pinch
like you to teach me that sometime
take artagnon here to sickbay
scotty we need power engine room acknowledge
who this
this is captain kevin thomas riley of the starship enterprise
this is captain kirk get out of the engine room navigator where mister scott cooks this is your captain speaking would like double portions of ice cream for the entire crew
clear that tube will you
yes sir favourite sings ll take you home again kathleen
captain at our present rate of descent we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere
and burn up know mister spock captain log stardate 1704 ship out of control spiraling down towards planet psi 2000 we have nineteen minutes of life left without engine power or helm control
how did riley get in there
he ran in said you wanted us on the bridge
he cut off both helm and power
and he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism
can you get to the auxiliary
can he hooked everything through the main panel in there get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead the only way to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here
singing the roses all have left your cheeks ve watched them fade away and die
status reports all sections
mister spock fight in the aft wardroom security reports incidents among the crewmen are increasing
go to alert baker two seal off main sections
all decks alert system two repeat go to alert condition baker two seal off all main sections stand by
we re going to seal off captain if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is
continue the alert lieutenant
can sir he cut off the alert channels
lieutenant uhura but there ll be no ice cream for you tonight
cut him off
can sir there no way to do it formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight
no way captain he controls the main power panels he can override any channel from down there seventeen minutes left sir ship is jolted severely
sickbay to bridge
can you tie me in to the sickbay
getting you jim look can you keep this beast level ve got sulu tranquillized and we re running tests on him bloodstream body functions seem normal
riley the immediate problem doctor is there any way anything you can do to snap him out of it
negative until can get little farther on these tests some additional orders
in the future all female crew members will wear their hair loosely about their shoulders makeup women women should not look made up and now crew will render kathleen one more time
please not again
singing ll take you home again kathleen meanwhile scott is working in jefferies tube ve watched them fade away and die
ve set the jumpers up there stand by til give you signal
and tears bedim your loving eyes oh
engineering to bridge try your helm you ll have enough power to keep her stabilised here let have look at that
sixteen minutes left captain we ve stabilised but still spiraling down
emergency signal captain both decks four and five fights and disorders
get me sickbay
have no intercom for sickbay he keeps switching channels on me
see what you can do to help doctor mccoy better check scotty first move him faster he got to get through that bulkhead
crewman report to the lab
singing ll take you home again janice
what going on
mister spock trying to get to the bridge and this crewman won let me by
crewman stand aside
oh yes sir ll take you home again janice
spock
message from the captain
tell him doing my best if cut through the wrong circuits
we have fourteen minutes left
even if we were under full-scale attack couldn move any faster not and maintain safety factor
at the rate you re proceeding calculations show that you ll take minute and half more than we have left you can afford safety factor
biopsy lab biopsy where my report biopsy come in harrison where my report going to the lab
sir
yes
the tranquillizer wearing off
oh good ll need him conscious now continue to examine him on circuits one and three
of course doctor
get him out of here
would have gotten here sooner sir but crewman moody stopped me in the hallway
take the helm
sir
take the helm
yes sir
at least try cutting him off
sir if could cut him off don you think
yes sir ll keep trying
sorry
scotty
we ve got twelve minutes left it ll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now
call me when you ve cut through want to be there kirk out
nurse where is doctor mccoy
he gone to the lab
lab lab respond please spock here lab
mister spock
what is it nurse
mister spock takes his hand the men from vulcan treat their women strangely at least people say that but you re part human too know you don you couldn hurt me would you in love with you mister spock you the human mister spock the vulcan mister spock
nurse you should
christine please see things how honest you are know how you feel you hide it but you do have feeling oh how we must hurt you torture you
in control of my emotions
the others believe that don love you don know why but love you do love you just as you are oh love you
sorry take the bridge acknowledge
am sorry
christine
christine acknowledge spock is struggling to keep his control
almost ready sir fresh and green ll take you to your home
ready sir
to security follow me through put your phasers on stun don fire unless he armed go
ll take no dance tonight
get him out of here
close to tears in control of my emotions control of my emotions am an officer an officer my duty my duty is is my duty is to to too late sorry to two four six six six times six
scotty we haven got much time left
kirk here
captain
what is it
he turned the engines off completely cold it will take thirty minutes to regenerate them shows we have about eight minutes left
scotty
can change the laws of physics ve got to have thirty minutes captain log supplemental the enterprise spiraling down out of control ship outer skin heating rapidly due to friction with planet atmosphere
maybe twenty two twenty three minutes
scotty we ve got six
captain you can mix matter and antimatter cold we go up in the biggest explosion since
we can balance our engines into controlled implosion
that only theory it never been done
bridge have you found mister spock yet
if you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one maybe assuming we had row of computers working weeks on the right formula
mister spock is not on the bridge captain
waking up screaming was on the bridge hey doc what am doing here
mccoy to bio we ve isolated it start preparing serum
it water somehow on this planet water changed to complex chain of molecules
that how we missed it it passed from man to man through perspiration once in the bloodstream it acts like alcohol depresses the centres of judgment self-control now get someone to the lab tell them the serum works and start preparing more
doc will you let me out of here all right
release him rooms report cycling station report this will be an emergency restart of engines
where have you been what happened
my mother could never tell her loved her
we ve got four minutes maybe five
an earth woman living on planet where love emotion is bad taste
we ve got to risk full-power start the engines were shut off no time to regenerate them do you hear me we ve got to risk full-power start
respected my father our customs was ashamed of my earth blood kirk slaps him jim when feel friendship for you ashamed
hitting him repeatedly you ve got to hear me we need formula we ve got to risk implosion
never been done understand jim ve spent whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings finally hits kirk back
we ve got to risk implosion it our only chance
it never been done
don tell me that again science officer it theory it possible we may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded but we ve got to take that one in ten thousand chance
yes found mister spock talking to mister spock do you understand
yes sir three and half minutes left captain
ve got it the disease love you re better off without it and better off without mine this vessel give she takes she won permit me my life ve got to live hers
jim
have beautiful yeoman have you noticed her mister spock you re allowed to notice her the captain not permitted
jim there is an intermix formula
now know why it called she
it never been tested it theoretical relationship between time and antimatter
flesh woman to touch to hold beach to walk on few days no braid on my shoulder
captain
scotty help
stand by to intermix ll call the formulae in from the bridge twenty one hundred seventy degrees
ve got to hang on tell them clear the corridors the turbo lift hurry scott and spock leave never lose you never
bridge mccoy gives kirk hypo as he leaves the turbolift
engine room we re set hyperbolic course
direction sir
direction direction it doesn matter the way we came
course laid in sir
fuel temperature
level
gazing at janice no beach to walk on
sir
raise antimatter eight and forty degrees
that ll take four minutes
we haven the time we ll have to risk it bridge we re ready
engage
are you all right jim
are you spock nods
we found cure we re over that part of it
obviously we were successful the engines imploded
captain my velocity gauge is off the scale
engine power went off the scale as well we re now travelling faster than is possible for normal space
checked elapsed time mister sulu
my chronometer running backwards sir
time warp we re going backward in time helm begin reversing power slowly
helm answering sir power reversing
we re back to normal time captain
engines ahead warp one
warp one sir
mister spock
yes sir
the time warp what did it do to us
we ve regressed in time seventy one hours it is now three days ago captain we have three days to live over again
not those last three days
this does open some intriguing prospects captain since the formula worked we can go back in time to any planet any era
we may risk it someday mister spock resume course to our next destination mister sulu
course laid in sir
steady as she goes captain log stardate 1513 our position orbiting planet m-113 on board the enterprise mister spock temporarily in command on the planet the ruins of an ancient and long-dead civilisation ship surgeon mccoy and myself are now beaming down to the planet surface our mission routine medical examination of archaeologist robert crater and his wife nancy routine but for the fact that nancy crater is that one woman in doctor mccoy past [planet
shall we pick some flowers doctor when man visits an old girlfriend she usually expects something like that
is that how you get girls to like you by bribing them there doesn seem to be anybody around does there
they ll be along you rushed us down ten minutes early enter building [crater
professor crater professor mrs crater nervous dr mccoy
yeah little bit guess you see we walked out of each other lives ten years ago she married crater and for all know she may have forgotten me completely of all the bonehead ideas jim how let myself in for things like this
singing outside then enters leonard
nancy
hello
it good to see you
let me look at you
you haven aged day oh this is captain jim kirk of the enterprise
seeing an older woman than mccoy does mrs crater ve heard great deal about you
all good hope
and crewman darnell
seeing young blonde how do you do ma am
something wrong darnell
excuse me sir but ma am if didn know better would swear you were someone left behind on wrigley pleasure planet it funny you re exactly like girl that
little less mouth darnell
sorry didn mean to mean know it impossible of course
why don you step outside darnell
yes sir thank you sir
maybe ll step outside too
what and let plum examine me all alone
plum
plum
nickname gave leonard when we were very young
ll er ll wait for the professor and ll catch you both at once
better go get bob every time he starts digging he forgets time sleep food everything be back in minute [planet
it quite warm here isn it encourages darnell to follow her captain log additional entry since our mission was routine we had beamed down to the planet without suspicion we were unaware each member of the landing party was seeing different woman different nancy crater [crater
professor crater captain kirk this is
the heroic captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar space to preserve our health your sense of duty is overwhelming now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone we need salt against the heat aside from that we re doing very well thank you
pleased you re doing well but required to confirm that fact
doubtless the good surgeon will enjoy prodding and poking us with his arcane machinery go away we don want you
what you want is unimportant right now what you will get is required by the book
quote all research personnel on alien planets are required to have their health certified by starship surgeon at one year intervals like it or not professor as commander of the starship required
to show your gold braid to everyone you love it don you
he all yours plum doctor mccoy
sit down and breathe deeply please
did hear you call him doctor mccoy
you did
mccoy ve heard nancy speak of doctor mccoy
that me didn she mention was here
you ve seen nancy
she went out to get you
you ve seen her too you were with the good doctor
yes why
nothing it just that it gives me pleasure to know that she gotten to see an old friend and has chance for some company it different for me enjoy solitude but for woman you understand of course
well it certainly hasn aged her she looks exactly as knew her twelve years ago amazing jim like girl of twenty five
sorry sorry captain sit down seem to have forgotten my manners
quite all right
not joking jim she hasn aged day she doesn have grey hair on her head
she got some grey bones excuse me professor she handsome woman yes but hardly twenty five
you ve seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment doctor sure when nancy lets when you see her again she ll be believable age
well at any rate she doesn look day over thirty
genuine affection glad you still feel it for her leonard isn it she fine woman
open your mouth
why thought the machine
the machine is capable of almost anything but ll still put my trust in healthy set of tonsils now open your mouth woman screams they dash out kirk with his phaser drawn [planet darnell is lying on rock nancy is standing by him
removing piece of plant from darnell mouth mccoy
dead jim strange red mottling all over his face
what happened
what do you suppose happened captain you beam down crewman who doesn know better than to eat an untested plant
ve just lost crewman mrs crater want to know what happened
well
take it easy nancy just tell us what you know
was just couldn find bob and was coming back crossed to your crewman wanted him to know wasn offended by the things he said back there you remember then noticed he had borgia plant in his hand before could say anything he he taken bite from it he fell his face all twisted and leonard you re looking at me like you don believe me
no no no no it not that it something entirely different jim suppose we could complete these examinations later
we don need an examination you can see that perhaps you better take your man and
we re well aware of our next duties professor we ll complete your examinations tomorrow transporter room
lock onto us three beaming up
salt you did ask them about more salt tablets
ll take care of the provisioning nancy
miss uhura your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column
mister spock sometimes think if hear that word frequency once more ll cry
cry
was just trying to start conversation
well since it is illogical for communications officer to resent the word frequency have no answer
no you have an answer an illogical woman who beginning to feel too much part of that communications console why don you tell me an attractive young lady or ask me if ve ever been in love tell me how your planet vulcan looks on lazy evening when the moon is full
vulcan has no moon miss uhura
not surprised mister spock report one death
bridge acknowledging
don believe it
explain
you explain that means that somebody is dead and you just sit there it could be captain kirk he the closest thing you have to friend
lieutenant my demonstration of concern will not change what happened the transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance
she called it borgia plant
something new to me
go ahead mister spock carbon group three vegetation similar to earth nightshade family alkaloid poison chemical structure common to class planets about the strange mottling on his facial skin surface there is no reference to this symptom
hmm well then this man wasn poisoned
stand by mister spock she said she saw him eat the plant
she mistaken know alkaloid poison what to look for there not trace of it in his body
there were bits of the plant in his mouth
jim don tell me my business he could not have swallowed any my instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever
then what kills healthy man
ll tell you something else this man shouldn be dead can find anything wrong with him according to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here don know ll have the tests double-checked my eyes may be tricking me swear jim when first saw her she looked just as known her ten years ago granted for moment may have been looking at her through romantic haze
how your lost love affects your vision doctor doesn interest me ve lost man want to know what killed him
yes sir captain log stardate 1513 in orbit around planet m-113 one crewman member of the landing party dead by violence cause unknown but we are certain the cause of death was not poison
message captain starship base on caran requesting explanation of our delay here sir space commander dominguez says we have supplies he urgently needs tell jose he ll get his chili peppers when we get there tell him they re prime mexican reds handpicked them myself but he won die if he goes few more days without them got it
got it captain
well
no mistake in our record tapes borgia plant its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison
and professor crater and wife
check out perfectly they arrived here nearly five years ago visited by various vessels made fairly heavy shipments out of artefacts and reports however there has been marked drop in shipments during the last year
kirk here
what is it
rather not put it on the speaker
fascinating
so improbable we almost didn check it
what
sodium chloride not trace of it
this man has no salt in his body at all
can you explain that doctor
can except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his
he would die almost instantly
how there isn mark on his body
except the red rings on his face
you called that skin mottling
thought it was sir another error on my part
not counting them bones are you in the mood for an apology
oh forget it probably was mooning over her should have been thinking about my job
perhaps you were both nancy and crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed
salt tablets
mister spock outfit landing party we re beaming down with some questions [crater
one might think that you had more important duties than harassing people captain
have professor believe me have where is mrs crater want to talk to her too
captain you can just beam down here and bully us and interfere with our work
mrs crater won ask again
possibly at the other diggings we don keep military logs
green find her
yes sir leaves
mister spock
sturgeon transport sample of the plant to mister spock we ll check if it actually the borgia plant or something we don understand sturgeon leaves you got that mister spock
captain considering the inescapable fact that you are trespasser on my planet
your complaint is noted sir look something we don understand killed one of my men it could prove to be danger to you and mrs crater too
we ve been here for almost five years if there were anything hostile here we would know about it wouldn we
bones tell the professor what the autopsy revealed
our crewman died of salt depletion sudden total loss of it medically impossible by any standards
and by coincidence both you and mrs crater requested salt tablets
and your esteemed physician cannot explain our need for salt tablets
we re all aware of the need for salt on hot and arid planet like this professor but it mystery and don like mysteries they give me bellyache and ve got beauty right now
opening storage box nancy and started with twenty five pounds this is what we have left few tablets at the bottom of jar now what is so mysterious about that
checking tablets salt
one of the missions of the enterprise is to protect human life in places like this going to have to ask you and mrs crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman
but you can do that
but can professor how you ve been here five years will couple of days make difference mister spock
arrange quarters for professor and mrs crater did you get the plant analysis darnell death
jim he run off crater finds sturgeon body
nancy you salt ve got salt smell it smell it nancy nancy is kneeling by green body she stands at the call
professor crater professor professor
jim jim it sturgeon he dead
we better locate crewman green green green crewman green report green nancy changes into green
crewman green report green green where are you could it be crater he came this way
don know green green arrives did you see this
yes sir sturgeon was dead when found him was circling to find whatever it was
same red rings on his face have you seen nancy mrs crater
no sir checked all through the ruins
worried about her jim she not at the quarters she not at the diggings she could be in trouble nancy
crater
nancy it leonard
we re beaming aboard the ship doctor
you can leave her
we can search this whole planet on foot
jim
you could learn something from mister spock doctor stop thinking with your glands we ve equipment aboard the enterprise that could pinpoint match lit anywhere on this planet or the heat of body transporter room kirk speaking three to beam up [transporter
kirk to bridge
break out the surface search equipment want co-ordinates on two people
there body down there sturgeon
we ll bring him home sir
you could use some sleep bones
all right jim
bridge
oh green what went on down there he reaches for the salt cellar who do you think you are they enter turbolift
something odd captain you said two people
professor and nancy crater
we get reading on only one person probably crater he circling as if searching for something
expand search radius
yes sir green is following rand
why don you go chase an asteroid
hey janice is that for me
don you wish it was
how about that
yeah how you like to have her as your personal yeoman [life
where are you sulu
in here feeding the weepers janice
ve got your tray
may the great bird of the galaxy bless your planet
thank you hello beauregard how are you today darling
her name gertrude
no it he plant girl can tell
why do people have to call inanimate objects she like she fast ship
he is not an inanimate object he so animate he makes me nervous in fact keep expecting one of these plants of yours to grab me
hello green
he not talking today you been nipping saurian brandy or something beauregard starts screeching and slithers down into it stem green rushes out
stroking plant take it easy calm down very sensitive
he the real spook suppose he going space happy or something uhura to crewmen the door to my quarters still rattles when it opens would you stop by and see if you can do something about it thanks bobby green changes into african crewman crewman do know you
in way ma am you were just thinking of someone like me guessing of course but you do look little lonely
see so naturally when lonely think of you
ina cuvanea mwanamke turee
una kafeeri hur you re swahili for her face lieutenant uhura to the bridge
better get this tray back bye beauregard
wait minute ll walk along
lieutenant uhura on my way sir [mccoy
mccoy to bridge captain there located mrs crater what the matter can you sleep
nope week you ll sleep
the simple fact is unless there something seriously wrong with the ship equipment there only one person within one hundred mile circle
all right we ll triangulate on him we ll let professor crater explain what happened to his wife to uhura remember my instructions lieutenant keep tight fix on us if we let out yell want an armed party down there before the echo dies
yes captain [mccoy uhura crewman has found mccoy quarters and transforms into nancy
nancy well come in come in ve been worried sick about you wonder why jim didn tell me he found you
so happy to see you leonard the others they don relate to them as much as you you have such strong memories of me
well
you do care don you leonard it makes me feel so so safe
nancy er
my husband like your feelings better much stronger but you re tired you need to rest
you re as bad as jim kirk he been telling me to take these
think you should ll get you some water crewman lies dead with mottles on his face
look at his face
bridge sulu trouble on deck nine section two we need medical team captain log stardate 1513 am now certain that the violent death of my crewmen was caused by some strange life-form [mccoy
lying on bed was so worried your husband acting strange crewmen dying
you re so tired darling just rest now
it nothing dear it nothing you just sleep nancy will take care of everything changes to mccoy dr mccoy to the bridge captain log additional armed and able-bodied crewmen are not attacked and slaughtered this easily apparently the killer can immobilize them as it approaches perhaps with some hypnotic or paralysing power the answer lies with professor crater [planet
professor crater
go away we don want you here
we where your wife professor we re concerned about her
armed go away
where your wife professor
she no concern of yours
we re worried about her safety aren you professor you re reasonable man let me comm beep kirk here same symptoms
spock cutting in captain something here through the arches to your left
stand by mister sulu spock has something
green
he beamed up to the ship with us
or something did
enterprise from kirk
you have an intruder aboard could be masquerading as crewman green general quarters security condition three assistance there
crater knows the creature if we could take him alive
negative lieutenant but keep locked in on us kirk out let get him phaser fire
we don want you here we re happy alone ll kill to stay alone you hear that kirk or you ll have to kill me ii don care either way
obviously taking him alive is going to be difficult
set your phaser on one quarter ll leave mine on stun
why risk your life for his
he not trying to kill us he trying to frighten us and he doing pretty good job
gq three now secured except for decks five seven and ten come in please
he not in supply and maintenance
go to engineering now run through file photos of the crewmen there
check quarters no one has seen him
keep in mind if you find him he not crewman green the captain reports crewman green is dead
and he or rather it followed me thought there was something twitchy about him
he whatever was probably your crewman too lieutenant
he must have been it you know would have remembered crewman like him
the creature leading you merry chase mister sulu
the creature
or whatever it is that killing the crewmen perhaps can help fill me in [planet spock and kirk are circling around crater from different directions
set
acknowledged crater kirk fires his phaser
your wife professor where is she your wife professor where is she
she was the last of her kind
the last of her kind
the last of its kind earth history remember like the passenger pigeon or buffalo ooh feel strange
just stunned you ll be able to think in minute
the earth buffalo what about it
once there were millions of them prairies black with them one herd covered three whole states and when they moved they were like thunder
and now they re gone is that what you mean
like the creatures here once there were millions of them now there one left nancy understood
always in the past tense
where your wife where is she now
dead buried up on the hill it killed her
when
oh year or was it two
kirk to enterprise
it definite mister sulu the intruder can assume any shape crewmen you myself anyone do you understand
go to gq four
the creature was trying to survive it has that right doesn it
kirk to transporter room three to beam up
they needed salt to stay alive there was no more salt it the last one the buffalo there is no difference
there one professor your creature is killing my people captain log continuing the enterprise has been invaded by creature capable of assuming any form and with the capacity to paralyse and draw the life from any one of us
security here in sight [briefing
negative captain ve checked every face on this vessel it was not crewman saw
yeoman rand how long was this green with you
as long as he it thought it could get to the salt on my tray sir
mister spock
supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels captain however no one or nothing has approached them as yet
dr mccoy
yes
medical department report doctor
oh well we could offer it salt without tricks there no reason for it to attack us
your attitude is laudable doctor but your reasoning is reckless
eyeing mccoy carefully the creature is not dangerous when fed
no it simply trying to survive by using its natural ability to take other forms
the way the chameleon uses its protective colouring an ability retained no doubt from its primitive state the way we have retained our incisor teeth they were once fangs certain of our muscles were designed for chase it uses its ability the way we would use our muscles and teeth if necessary to stay alive
and like us it an intelligent animal there no need to hunt it down
very interesting hypothesis doctor briefing room and locked away security four in effect on every level still no lead on intruder
thank you lieutenant continue the search crater we don know who or what we re looking for we need your help and now
demanded even begged that you get off my planet
can you recognise this thing when you see it professor ll forego charges up to this point but this creature aboard my ship and ll have it or ll have your skin or both now where is it
loved nancy very much few women like my nancy she lives in my dreams she walks and sings in them
and it becomes nancy for you
not because of tricks it doesn trick me it needs love as much as it needs salt when it killed nancy almost destroyed it but it isn just beast it is intelligent and the last of its kind
you bleed too much crater you re too pure and noble are you saving the last of its kind or has this become crater private heaven here on this planet this thing becomes wife lover best friend wise man fool idol slave it isn bad life to have everyone in the universe at your beck and call and you win all the arguments
you don understand
have you learned to see this thing in whatever form it becomes
yes
are you going to help us find it
sorry can
recommend we use truth serum captain
doctor
well resist using it but in this case the professor will give us the truth
take him
ll accompany you doctor
oh yes of course
on biobed it wasn mccoy it was the creature it hit me crater grabbed my phaser wondered about mccoy doubt had crossed my mind
captain professor crater
dead but it had you too
fortunately my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did my blood cells are quite different [mccoy
leonard leonard wake up please help me help me leonard they re trying to kill me don let them kill me
easy easy nobodies going to
but you must help me
move aside bones
what going on here jim
she not nancy bones
are you insane
it killed four crewmen now crater
it
the creature it kills it needs salt to live bones move aside
no
my guess is she needs more you want it nancy come and get it
you re frightening her jim
not fright hunger look at her
leonard if you love me make him go away
come on you want this nancy come on nancy come and get it come and get it here it is
leonard help me
stop it jim
mccoy get out of the way
are you out of your mind
get out of the way mccoy and kirk struggle for the phaser while nancy grabs and eats the salt tablets mccoy wins and is pushed away then she transfixes kirk and reaches for his face
it killing the captain shoot it doctor quickly
no no they struggle for the phaser spock gets between nancy and kirk
it killing the captain shoot quick
won shoot nancy
this is not nancy hitting her repeatedly if she were nancy could she take this
stop it stop it spock stop it nancy sends spock flying with one slap
is that nancy doctor
no she goes to kirk again no she transforms into her natural state Â kirk screams mccoy fires the phaser she changes back into nancy
leonard leonard no leonard please
lord forgive me he fires again and she dies
sorry bones
ready to leave orbit captain
something wrong captain
was thinking about the buffalo mister spock warp one mister sulu
warp one sir leaving orbit captain log star date 1533 now manoeuvring to come alongside cargo vessel antares its captain and first officer are beaming over to us with an unusual passenger
all right chief begin materialisation captain ramart captain kirk
this is my navigator tom nellis
how do you do
how do you do
and this is our young castaway charlie charlie evans his dossier
mister evans we ve heard great deal about you welcome aboard
wonderful boy charlie its been an honour having him aboard
why it been great pleasure the things that he learned in the last
absolutely to think this boy spent practically his whole life alone on that planet everyone killed just few microtapes to learn from
how many humans like me on this ship
like whole city in space charlie over four hundred in the crew of starship aren there captain
four hundred and twenty eight to be exact is there anything we can do for you captain medical supplies provisions
hundreds all human like me that exciting is that the right word
that perfect it the exact word
you see we like to keep charlie with us but with his closest living relatives on colony five and your vessel going that way why
like to see your ship now all of it the people and everything
you keep interrupting mister evans that considered wrong
sorry
we have large supply of entertainment tapes gentlemen
no we ve tight schedule to make captain just twenty of us we re making out fine
this must be space first transport ship that doesn need anything
nothing
not even sarian brandy
we re fine thank you pleasant journey captain
thank you the pair are beamed off
yeoman rand this is charles evans show him to his quarters and drop his records off at doctor mccoy office if you will
yes sir come with me please
are you girl is that girl
that girl captain log star date 1533 we have taken aboard an unusual passenger for transport to colony alpha five charles evans the sole survivor of transport crash fourteen years ago the child alone from age three has not only survived but has grown to intelligent healthy adolescence
tell me the ship supply of food concentrates couldn have lasted fourteen years
after that found other things to eat just growing around
and you learned to talk by just listening to the ship tapes
the memory banks still worked they talked to me and talked back
you re four-oh
four
four-oh one hundred percent sound of wind and limb
that that captain kirk
yeah
why does he call me mister evans
because that your name
he not well he isn like captain ramart
well no captain kirk is one of kind charlie
do you like me
why not
some the other ship they didn like me tried trying to make people like me want them to like me
most seventeen year olds do come on let go ll show you to your quarters
hey ll put the equipment away see you in the rec room huh
you got deal friend slaps man on bottom
all right to charlie hello
brought you present bottle of perfume
oh thank you really appreciate it but but have to go on duty
do you like that kind
yes it my favourite where did you get it they don have any in the ship stores
it present
know but where did gee late charlie really have to go
can you stay and talk little while
look off duty at fourteen hundred why don you join me in recreation room six deck three
you got deal friend slaps her bottom
charlie
thought don be angry didn wanted
charlie you you you just don go around slapping girls on the it okay but er just don do it again
don be angry
look why don you tell captain kirk or doctor mccoy what you did they ll explain it to you okay
will
okay
but tell me what reason would he have to lie if there are thasians
that is very intriguing question scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant captain
good doctor mccoy mister spock is working out
excuse me captain status report
thank you he working out training programme for charlie evans earth history his own background that sort of thing like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of um er adolescence
well don you think it be better for strong father image like you he already looks up to you
the job is yours bones flattery will get you nowhere
doctor didn the boy make any reference at all to thasians
do you believe the legend mister spock that thasians still exist on that planet in some form
charlie very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on thasus he could not possibly have survived alone the ship food concentrates would have been exhausted in year or so
by which time he would have been eating fruits vegetables
probes of thasus indicate very little edible plant life
and probes have been known to be wrong spock
doctor are you speaking scientifically or emotionally
gentlemen the fact is the boy is here and he alive and he needs our help
and he needs guide and he needs father image jim
hmm ll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that or find him one spock is strumming his lyre when uhura starts humming spock stops
sorry did it again didn spock smirks and uhura begins playing again
singing oh on the starship enterprise there someone who in satan guise whose devil ears and devil eyes could rip your heart from you at first his look could hypnotise and then his touch would barbarise his alien love could victimise and rip your heart from you and that why female astronauts oh very female astronauts wait terrified and overwrought to find what he will do oh girls in space be wary be wary be wary girls in space be wary we know not what he ll do
one more time
singing now from planet out in space there comes lad not commonplace a-seeking out his first embrace he saving it for you oh charlie our new darling our darling our darling charlie our new darling we know not what he ll do uhura suddenly loses her voice and the lyre makes no sound
want to see something puts three cards face down turn them over they have pictures of rand on them
well how did you do that
oh can do lot of card tricks one of the men on the antares showed me the cards return to normal
don believe this hhe lays out the aces throws one over his shoulder then rand removes it from her cleavage
on earth today it thanksgiving if the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf want it to look like turkey charlie
captain supposed to ask you something why shouldn don know how to explain it
say it right out charlie that usually works
well in the corridor saw when janice when yeoman rand was slaps kirk bottom did that to her she didn like it she said you explain it to me
me see well um er there are things you can do with lady er charlie that you er there no right way to hit woman mean man to man is one thing but er man and woman er it er it er well it er another thing do you understand
don know
excuse me kirk here
on my way to the bridge now
can come with you
don think so charlie
won get in the way
okay
can you boost your power antares we re barely reading your transmission kirk
kirk here captain ramart
re-establish contact
they re not transmitting
keep trying
it wasn very well constructed
sweep the area of the antares transmission with our probe scanners mister spock
affirmative captain
you think something happened to the antares charlie
don know
picking up some debris on our scanners captain
what about the antares
the debris is what left of the antares
kirk here now real turkeys
chief have you beenÂ  charlie laughs and leaves captain log star date 1535 uespa headquarters notified of the mysterious loss of science probe vessel antares kirk and spock are playing 3d chess
your mind is not on the game captain check the antares
survey ship with twenty men aboard lost no reason obviously captain ramart was not aware of any trouble can figure it
my own concern is more immediate the boy
can usually follow you mister spock but this time
he seemed to know what happened to the antares before we did
call it pretty long reach for evidence mister spock come in charlie
and again check
checkmate
your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion captain
prefer to call it inspired
as you wish at any rate the game is yours
you play chess charlie
oh watched them play on the antares can try
place you in the hands of our chess master kirk gets up and leaves
the principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic charlie you put the white here and the black on the secondary level
know what it is let play
very well just three moves later that was mistake charlie
no it wasn
checkmate
no it isn
if you ll excuse me spock leaves charlie melts the white chess pieces
oh charlie was looking for you like you to meet tina lawton yeoman third class charlie evans
hello charlie
thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age
can talk to you alone
charlie tina
excuse me must be wanted somewhere
that was that was rude and completely uncalled-for
but don need her want to talk to you
that no excuse you better learn that right now you have to live with people charlie you re not alone anymore
but she not as she doesn she not the same not like you she she just girl you re you smell like girl all the other girls on the ship they they look just like tina you re the only one who looks like you you can understand can you you know about being with somebody wanting to be if had the whole universe give it to you when see you feel like hungry all over hungry do you know how that feels
what
wasn sure should er talk to you about this
charlie seventeen year old boy
exactly and he
talked to him about the swat
it not that captain ve seen the look before and if something isn done sooner or later going to have to hurt him tell him to leave me alone and that wouldn be good for him right now you see his first crush his first love and his first
yes yeoman ll talk to him ll look into it
thank you sir
come in charlie er charlie charlie do you know anything about this chess piece did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon
no sir is that all
er no no no sit down charlie being seventeen is more than how many years you ve lived it whole other thing doctor mccoy could probably explain the biological conditions well let let use specific yeoman rand is woman
oh won hit her like that anymore
no there more to it than that
everything do or say is wrong in the way don know the rules and when learn something and try to do it suddenly wrong
now wait wait
don know what am or what supposed to be or even who don know why hurt so much inside all the time
you ll live believe me there nothing wrong with you that hasn gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up
what if you care for someone what do you do
you go slow you be gentle mean it not one-way street you know how you feel and that all it how the girl feels too don press charlie if the girl feels anything for you at all you ll know it do you understand
you don think janice you she could love me
she not the girl charlie the years are wrong for one thing and there are other things
she can
no charlie
she is
no
but if did what you said if was gentle
charlie there are million things in this universe you can have and there are million things you can have it no fun facing that but that the way things are
then what am going to do
hang on tight and survive everybody does
you don
everybody charlie me too
trying but don know how
kirk here adjustments sir
ask mister spock to see to it charlie come on with me
you ve got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall go ahead try it like everything else it takes practice charlie try again good that much better here now ll show you shoulder roll try that
don want to do that
well it makes it hard to teach you
don want to do that
all right charlie lesson over for today
you were going to teach me how to fight
you have to learn to protect yourself in fall before do that it more than teaching you to defend yourself charlie want you to learn charlie hey sam let me borrow you for couple easy throws all right
right
watch this charlie that wasn so bad was it now ll throw him here we go sam
that looks hard
oh
come on charlie try it attaboy let go charlie can make kirk lose his balance he gets dumped instead
oh sam laughs
that wasn so bad was it
don laugh at me
cool off
don laugh at me sam disappears
charlie
he shouldn have done that it not nice to laugh at people
what happened to him charlie
he gone
that no answer
he gone didn mean to do that he made me do it he laughed at me
kirk here two men from security on the double
what are you going to do to me
confining you to quarters want you to stay there
won let them hurt me ll make them go away too
they won hurt you charlie security arrive they ll take you to your quarters charlie go with them charlie knocks them down one draws his phaser
no phaser disappears
go to your quarters
he was going to hurt me
go to your quarters or ll pick you up and carry you there
won let you
that your choice charlie
won let them hurt me
they won hurt you
kirk here shall repeat captain
no heard you have doctor mccoy and mister spock meet me in the briefing room
thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible it has generally been regarded as legend but charlie does seems to possess this same power
what are chances that charlie not an earthling that he thasian
no don think so not unless they re exactly like earthlings the development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on earth
agreed
well whatever he is we have some idea of the power he has know what saw him do in the gymnasium
considering the effect normal adolescent has on home charlie with the power he has
short-tempered because he doesn understand he needs he wants nothing happens fast enough
the probability is he responsible for the destruction of the antares which would indicate total disregard for human life
he doesn understand what life is he boy
well what do we do with this boy jim how do we keep him caged up
it goes even further than that doctor we can take him with us to earth colony five can you imagine what he do in an open normal environment ve talked with him listened he boy in man body trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way
and with weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone anywhere on this ship
well for the moment he stopped you re an authority he respects jim
agreed the struggle must remain between you and him should any of us interfereÂ  charlie enters under guard
you wanted to ask me something he said
are you responsible for what happened to the antares charlie
why
answer me
yes there was warped baffle-plate on the shield of their energy pile made it go away it would ve blown up anyway well they weren nice to me they wanted to get rid of me they don now
what about us charlie
don know charlie leaves
we re in the hands of an adolescent
lieutenant raise colony five want to speak directly to the governor
yes sir
navigator lay course away from colony five buy me some time
yes sir uhura console short-circuits and she is thrown to the floor
spock get the doctor up here on the double how bad is it
think it all right sir sir there no reason for that panel to cross-circuit like that checked it over myself not fifteen minutes ago
captain can feed any course co-ordinates into the panel sir it rejects the course change
helm doesn respond either sir charlie enters
mister spock you getting any readings on your instruments
yes sir there tyger tyger burning bright in the forest of the night
mister spock
trying to saturn rings around my head down road that martian red
you re trying to change course captain you can do that want to get to colony five as soon as we can
release the transmitter
you don need all that subspace chatter
what going on here spock calls me to the bridge and goes into some kind of poetry
see to her doctor
once upon midnight dreary while pondered weak and weary
very nice mister ears oh can make him do anything whirl around laugh anything
that enough charlie
don you think he funny think he funny
leave my crew alone charlie leaves
jim he ll soon reach point where he won back down
know
charlie what wrong he turns her into an iguana
have something for you rose pink is your favourite isn it
you don walk into room without knocking
don ever lock your door on me again janice love you
ll lock it when please what is it you want anyway
you only want to be nice to you can give you anything just just tell me
switching on comm want you to get out
spock
love you
you don know what the word means
then show me
no kirk and spock rush in charlie knocks them down
charlie she slaps him so he makes her disappear
why did she do that loved her but she wasn nice at all what you did wasn nice either but still need you captain the enterprise isn quite like the antares running the antares was easy you have to be nice all right gives pain
mister spock
my legs they re broken
let him go too charlie
why
because telling you to because you need me to run the ship and need him
if you try to hurt me again ll make lot of people go away
and what about yeoman janice is she dead gone destroyed
won tell you growing up isn so much not man and can do anything you can
ll activate the force field myself you can return to your section
he had mean look had to freeze him like happy looks enters room aren you coming in forcefield activates in the doorway so
that wasn nice you ll be sorry you wait you ll see you ll be sorry you did that unfreezes them you will he turns young woman into an old one some crew are laughing in room
no no laughing the shadows freeze then woman with no face feels her way around the corner
captain kirk my instruments show we re receiving message on subspace frequency three ship-to-ship can hear it sir
are you creating that message charlie or you re blocking one that coming in
it my game captain you have to find out like you said that how the game played you can have it now ve locked on course for colony five again leaves
ve waited long enough going to take him on
you don have any special immunity not anymore pushed far enough he send you off to oblivion too
mister spock
out of the question
wait minute does charlie now wait spock has he done away with anybody since he took over
not so far as we know
maybe he can could be he overreached himself it big ship he taken full control if we could tax his power turn on every device on the ship every circuit every light all of it and while he fighting that if could distract him maybe you could tranquilize him keep him under until we reach colony five
risky jim
if we don try doctor he ll get rid of us anyway there no choice gentlemen none at all
can make you all go away anytime want to
get out of my chair charlie and get out of it now
ve got your ship captain
maybe charlie but don think you can handle any more think you ve reached your limit and can take on one more thing but you re going to have to
could ve sent you away before but didn
you re going to have to take me on
don make me do it now
you ve got my ship and want it back want my crew back whole if have to break your neck to do it throws him out of command chair
don push me gives kirk pain sorry sorry but stop it said stop it
captain the navigation console is clear now the ship is answering the helm
sir something off our starboard bow the message says they re from thasus rand reappears
oh
captain how did
it all right yeoman
sensors show there something there captain deflectors indicate no solid substance
no oh no please don let them take me can live with them anymore you re my friends you said you were my friends remember when came aboard please want to go home take me home
have taken my form from centuries ago so that may communicate with you we did not realise until too late that the boy had gone and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the first ship we could not help them but we have returned your people and your ship to you everything is as it was
won do it again please ll be good won ever do it again sorry about the antares sorry when came aboard please want to go with you help me
the boy belongs with his own kind
that would be impossible
with training we can teach him to live in our society if he can be taught not to use his power
we gave him the power so he could live he will use it always and he would destroy you and your kind or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves
is there nothing you can do
we offer him life and we will take care of him come charles
oh please don let them take me can even touch them janice they can feel not like you they don love please want to stay fades away
charlie back on board the thasian ship sir they signal they re leaving
it all right yeoman it all over now enterprise is in orbit of planet
you ll enjoy commodore travers he sets good table
wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to cestus three
probably rank hath its privileges
how well we both know that intercom whistles
scotty kirk here
good commodore we re on our way interesting problem for them
we ll beam down immediately commodore kirk out
captain wonder why he insistent that our tactical aides come down
this colony is isolated exposed out on the edge of now here he probably wants additional advice
perhaps captain but nevertheless
spock isn it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality for one could use good non-reconstituted meal
doctor you are sensualist
you bet your pointed ears am ready whenever you are captain six men including one red shirt get on the transporter platform
energise there is no one waiting to meet them instead just razed ground and the smoke of few fires
kirk to enterprise red alert
cestus three has been destroyed they take cover
full alert tricorder readings mister spock life detection
those messages we got captain the one directing us here yesterday
faked all this happened several days ago to man in yellow shirt lang over there look for survivors kelowitz blue shirt that way to the red shirt herlihy stick with me
captain impulses that direction very weak possibly survivor
come on bones captain log stardate 3045 the enterprise has responded to call from earth observation outpost on cestus three on landing we have discovered that the outpost has been destroyed
captain over there they run to lone survivor amongst tangle of wreckage careful careful shock radiation burns internal injuries for certain
careful careful shock radiation burns internal injuries for certain he in bad way captain
keep him alive bones want to know what been happening here
getting another life reading captain
survivors
not survivors not warm-blooded living creatures but not human
where
azimuth ninety three degrees range one five seven zero yards
herlihy kirk sends his security guard off to look but he hasn gone far before he stands up and says
captain see something and promptly gets hit by beam and vanishes there also an incoming whistle and an explosion
cover kirk to enterprise lock on transporters beam us up
captain we re coming under attack unidentified ship quartering in up defensive screens
keep those screens up fire all phasers
firing phasers captain the alien has screens up too
take all action necessary to protect the ship we ll hold out here
are you under attack captain
keep those screens up worry about us when the ship is safe more bombs rain down around them
if they lower those screens to beam us up they ll be open to phaser attack
we re hopelessly outnumbered here captain it those disruptors versus our hand phasers
we re stuck with it mister spock we ll have to make do with what we ve got carrying the survivor the away team heads into better shelter life support ramp level according to the sign
kelowitz lang flank out lay down fire on co-ordinates mister spock gave you even if you don see them keep your heads down lang and kelowitz leave
we re helpless down here and the enterprise
sulu is an experienced combat officer
it my ship mister spock should be there we can even get at them
nor can they at us at the moment not unless they moved their original position that intervening high ground
can you remember the layout of this place the arsenal
about one hundred yards in that direction but after an attack as thorough as this one
ll risk it he does an heroic zigzag run amongst the incoming explosions takes shelter behind an oil drum and calls enterprise
kirk here report
captain are you all right
never mind about me what about the ship
we returned fire with all phaser banks negative against its deflector screen
arm your photon torpedoes
aye aye sir arm photon torpedoes stand by
any identification on the attacking vessel familiar with
we can get visual contact she too far away
mister sulu photon torpedoes locked on
photon torpedoes locked on captain kirk; fire all banks
all banks fired sir
sulu sulu our communications are being interfered with an explosion makes him run further on into an old bomb crater now get this straight protect the ship leave orbit maximum warp anything clear
clear captain but you
never mind about me protect my ship
yes sir photon torpedoes negative captain warping out of orbit
good contact me when you can kirk out kirk ducks into building meanwhile back over at ramp
how is he doctor
he ll be dead in half an hour if we don get him some decent care
they re moving ve got to get to the captain he joins kirk in the bomb crater where grenade launcher is being set up
locked on to the enemy captain they re moving toward the high ground fizzing sound and smoke they ve locked on to my tricorder he throws it away and it goes bang
very ingenious they fed back my own impulses and built up an overload
we ll see how ingenious they are here give me hand with this grenade launcher lang
any word from the enterprise
sulu taken her out of orbit
they got lang sir
did you see them
no sir
an evaluation mister kelowitz where do you think they are
if were them go to the high ground on the right make it twelve hundred yards azimuth eighty seven it pretty close for one of these little jewels captain
it ll be lot closer to them stand clear he drops blue ball into the launcher it zooms off and there is blinding flash and bang silence reigns until kirk communicator beeps
kirk here but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters
lock on to the alien mister sulu don want to lose her
aye aye sir our screens are down we can beam you up now sir
want search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors notify the transporter room lock onto us we re beaming up
aye aye sir captain log supplement we have beamed back to the enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel it appears to be headed toward largely unexplored section of the galaxy
can you tell me what happened
scanners reported ship approaching we get them now and then they re all welcome to use our facilities you know that
yes know
they came in space normal speed using our regular approach route but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo from then on we were helpless we weren expecting anything why should we we didn have anything anyone would want
easy easy
they poured it on like like phasers only worse whatever they were using tried to signal them we called up tried to surrender we had women and children told them that begged them they wouldn listen they didn let up for moment
lieutenant the enterprise received two messages ostensibly from cestus three one for the enterprise to go there and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface
they hit us full day before you got there captain no messages came from us captain why did they do it why why did they do it there has to be reason there has to be reason
it was trap getting the enterprise to come to cestus three getting us and our whole crew to come ashore
very clever as to the reason
the reason is crystal clear the enterprise is the only protection in this section of the federation destroy the enterprise and everything is wide open
you allude to invasion captain yet positive proof
have all the proof need on cestus three
not necessarily sir several possible explanations
how can you explain massacre like that no mister spock the threat is clear and immediate invasion
very well then if that the case you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base
intend to if we can keep them in the dark as to our strength they ll never dare move against us captain to helmsman
is the alien still making warp five
initiate warp six
overtake phaser banks lock on to the enemy vessel stand by for firing orders all hands this is the captain we are going into battle all hands battle stations red alert repeat red alert this is no drill this is no drill captain log stardate 3046 we are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the earth outpost on cestus three
mister depaul
yes sir
position
twenty two point three parsecs beyond latest chart limit sir
all scanners lock into computer banks want complete record of this mister spock what do we have on this general area
virtually nothing captain no records of any explorations there are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels however none has ever been recorded
anything on intelligent life forms
nothing specific captain unscientific rumours only more like space legends
mister sulu status alien vessel
they must be aware we re after them sir they ve gone to warp six also
warp factor seven
aye aye sir
something the matter mister spock
sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous captain
thank you mister spock mean to catch them
we ll either catch them or blow up captain they may be faster than we are
they ll have to prove it yes mister spock
you mean to destroy the alien ship captain
of course
thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient destruction might be unnecessary
colony cestus three has been obliterated mister spock
the destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony jim
if the aliens go unpunished they ll be back attacking other federation installations
merely suggested that regard for sentient life
there no time for that it matter of policy out here we re the only policemen around and crime has been committed do make myself clear
very clear captain
delighted mister spock report mister sulu
alien ship maintaining interval captain now at warp seven
warp factor eight everyone looks surprised scotty is aghast
aye aye sir
captain to phaser banks all components at battle ready all banks primed operational ready later the ship has not blown up and sulu has grin on his face
captain
yes mister sulu
closing on target sir
good mister depaul
yes sir
our position
two two seven nine pl sir uncharted solar system at two four six six pm
is it on the alien course
no sir he headed away from it
captain sensors report we re being scanned
by the alien ship
no sir it from that solar system ahead
any interference resistance
no sir just scanning beams it on an unusual wave length
mister spock
it would appear someone is curious about us
mister sulu is the alien still heading away from that solar system
yes sir we re closing sir
lieutenant uhura anything further on those scanning beams
there no hostility sir they re not tractors or weapons of any sort just increasing in intensity steady regular it growing stronger sir
captain
yes what is it
the alien it slowing down warp five four two it going sublight sir sir it stopped dead in space
he may be turning to fight
no sir they re just dead out there
are you sure
yes sir unmoving
then we ve got them go to red alert prepare to fire phaser banks sensors lock on mister sulu continue closing mister spock lock phasers into computer computers will control attack
computer lock ready captain all systems standing by
range is one eight one zero one seven six zero range is one seven zero zero one six four zero range is one five nine zero one five five zero and closing sir suddenly the ship decelerates and everyone hangs on to something as the lights dim
warp six warp five four warp three warp one sublight captain we re stuck captain it impossible but it impossible
from warp eight have you lost your mind
same as the alien captain
mister scott report
we re dead captain locked up frozen tight all propulsion systems read zero kirk; life systems
they re all normal sir atmosphere heat light no variance
phaser banks report faulty circuits can find just no power
damage control report
all systems report normal captain no ascertainable damage kirk; then what is it
don know sir but whatever it is we canna move
we re being held in place captain apparently from that solar system kirk; this far out that impossible
we are being held
tractor beam
no sir an unidentifiable power the lights flicker and the viewscreen goes psychedelic come into our space on mission of violence this is not permissible yet we have analysed you and have learned that your violent tendencies are inherent so be it we will control them we will resolve your conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities captain james kirk
this is kirk will be taken there as will the captain of the gorn ship which you have been pursuing there you will settle your dispute
don understand in hopes that chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship you will each be totally alone
what makes you think you can interfere with stop to it the place we have prepared for you contains sufficient elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other which seems to be your intention the winner of the contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed the loser along with his ship shall be destroyed in the interests of peace the contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity brute strength against brute strength the results will be final
just minute kirk vanishes and uhura screams
he gone dinosaur- like being with multifaceted eyes and multicoloured tunic greets us with roar kirk is now wearing belt with the recorder/translator on it pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces and have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid facing the captain of the alien ship weaponless face the creature the metrons called gorn large reptilian like most humans seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles must fight to remember that this is an intelligent highly advanced individual the captain of starship like myself undoubtedly dangerously clever opponent the gorn breaks branch of tree with great ease kirk struggles to break off twig their first physical engagement is uneven kirk is more agile than the reptile but nowhere near as strong he boxes the gorn ears to get out of bear-hug and runs up into the rocks looking for weapons he throws heavy rock at the gorn but it just bounces off his chest when boulder gets flung at him in return kirk retreats quickly spock goes over to the engineering station
have you tried overload
aye sir it does no good
how about bypassing the transformer banks feed the impulse engines directly
tried that sir nothing
lieutenant uhura have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here
no sir they report they definitely emanate from that solar system ahead
no indication of its composition gravimetric magnetic electronic
nothing sir standing on rocks silhouetted against clear blue sky kirk makes an entry on his recorder for posterity
this is captain james kirk of the starship enterprise who ever finds this please get it to starfleet command engaged in personal combat with creature apparently called gorn we see that the recording is also being transmitted and translated by the gorn device too me that would have killed human being fortunately though strong he is not agile the agility and hope the cleverness is mine back on the rock
the metrons the creatures that sent us both here said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons there very little here scrub brush rocks an abundance of mineral deposits but no weapons in the conventional sense still need to find one bare-handed against the gorn have no chance
leave channel one open lieutenant just in case
aye aye sir
what are you going to do mister spock
going to wait doctor there little else can do
what about the captain
if could help him would cannot
now you re the one that always talking about logic what about some logic now where the captain mister spock
he out there doctor out there somewhere in thousand cubic parsecs of space and there absolutely nothing we can do to help him running up slope kirk comes across clump of mature bamboo good solid hollow stems but he doesn regard them as suitable clubs he carries on gaining height meanwhile the gorn is using trailing vines to construct something kirk comes across an outcrop of minerals and decides to tell us what they are
large deposit of diamonds on the surface perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe beautifully crystallized and pointed but too small to be useful as weapon an incredible fortune in stones yet would trade them all for hand phaser or good solid club yet the metrons said there would be weapons if could find them where what kind from his vantage point on the ridge kirk watches the gorn at work then spots lone rock neatly balanced on pinnacle above his adversary he pushes it over the gorn looks up then we get the cloud of dust and view of the reptile under the rock lying still confident kirk comes down to check on his kill just in time to see the gorn move grasp his stone dagger and get up again the rock continues on its way down the slope the mammal runs away straight into reptiles trap of vines and rocks now kirk is pinned under boulder and at his enemy mercy but the gorn has to move the boulder to be able to stab him so once again kirk is able to dodge away albeit with limp
this is the enterprise calling the metrons our channels are open come in please we urgently desire conference please answer kirk hobbles up to rock face with bright yellow powder spread across it and takes rest we keep cutting to the gorn who can hear everything he says remember
this may be my last entry am almost exhausted unless find the weapon the metron mentioned have very little time left native sulphur diamonds this place is mineralogist dream yet there is something about sulphur something very old something if only could remember the gorn roar comes closer and he moves on
the ship our engines our weapons it just inconceivable that we are immobilised
but it has happened doctor dimmed lights and swirly viewscreen again would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements if any which are customary in your culture we believe you have very little time left
we appeal to you in the name of civilisation put stop to this not civilised however we are not without compassion it is possible you may have feelings toward your captain so that you will be able to prepare yourself we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring there on the viewscreen is their first sight of gorn then kirk and yet another mineral deposit
if there were only some way we could contact him
yes indeed doctor if only there were notice the substance encrusting that rock yes unless mistaken it potassium nitrate
so
perhaps nothing doctor kirk tastes the mineral and spits it out perhaps everything the bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and kirk goes off in you have said merciful and quick
can that be true was cestus three an intrusion on their space
it may well be possible doctor we know very little about that section of the galaxy
then we could be in the wrong
perhaps that is something best decided by diplomats
the gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves
yes they watch as kirk returns to the bamboo clump and picks out short wide stem
fascinating good good kirk cuts vines to length against rock he knows doctor he has reasoned it out potassium nitrate gets shoveled into the bamboo
yes yes
what is it spock spock; an invention doctor first potassium nitrate and now if he can find some sulphur and charcoal deposit or ordinary coal kirk is at the outcrop of sharp diamonds and putting them into the bamboo too
what he doing spock; diamonds the hardest known substance impelled by sufficient force they would make formidable projectiles
what force
recall your basic chemistry doctor gunpowder running now the sulphur goes into the cannon and finally he finds vein on coal spock; coal now kirk settles down to empty the bamboo crush the coal make hole in the bamboo for fuse and then mix his ingredients little more precisely
can he do it
if he has the time doctor if he has the time the cannon is strengthened with the vine tied around it and the gunpowder gets rammed home with small branch finally the diamonds go in and piece of torn trouser will serve as fuse once he can raise spark from stone and the translating device fire is created as the gorn approaches him from behind seeing the danger he braces the cannon and fires it the explosion blows the bamboo apart and also incapacitates his opponent kirk picks up his fallen stone dagger and puts the point to the gorn windpipe but cannot administer the coup de grace
no no won kill you maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost he throws the dagger away stands up and shouts to the sky
no won kill him do you hear you ll have to get your entertainment someplace else the gorn disappears and young blond boy in white shift appears instead
you re metron
does my appearance surprise you captain
you seem more like boy
am approximately fifteen hundred of your earth years old you surprise me captain
how
by sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed you you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy something we hardly expected we feel there may be hope for your kind therefore you will not be destroyed it would not be civilised
what happened to the gorn
sent him back to his ship if you like shall destroy him for you
no that won be necessary we can talk maybe reach an agreement
very good captain there is hope for you perhaps in several thousand years your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement you are still half savage but there is hope we will contact you when we are ready kirk suddenly appears in front of the crew who all leap to their feet
captain are you all right
don know don know all right everybody back to your posts let get out of here he takes his seat
captain
mister sulu
it impossible but there sirius over there when it should be here and canopus and arcanis we re all of sudden we re clear across the galaxy five hundred parsecs from where we are mean were mean
don try and figure it out mister sulu just plot course for us back to cestus three
aye aye sir mccoy leaves
after you touched off your primitive cannon captain we lost the picture the metron was sending us kirk; you saw what happened down there
most of it would be interested in knowing what finally happened
we re most promising species mister spock as predators go did you know that
ve frequently had my doubts
don not anymore and maybe in thousand years or so we ll be able to prove it never mind mister spock it doesn make much sense to me either take us back to where we re supposed to be mister sulu warp factor one
warp factor one
thousand years captain well that gives us little time captain log star date 1312 the impossible has happened from directly ahead we re picking up recorded distress signal the call letters of vessel which has been missing for over two centuries did another earth ship once probe out of the galaxy as we intend to do what happened to it out there is this some warning they ve left behind
your move captain
we should have intercepted by now the bridge said they call
ll have you checkmated your next move
have ever mentioned you play very irritating game of chess mister spock
irritating ah yes one of your earth emotions
certain you don know what irritation is
the fact one of my ancestors married human female
terrible having bad blood like that tractor beam range
no visual contact mister kelso reads about one metre in diameter
not large enough even for lifeboat risk it
lock onto it mister kelso
materialiser ready sir
bring it aboard old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship
more like destroyed the ship in this case look at it burnt pitted
let hope its tapes are intact we ll feed it through mister spock computer
yes sir it begun transmitting sir
flash the bridge put all decks on the alert
hold it jim
getting into shape
yeah well figured you weren on the bridge kelso voice sounded little nervous well uh you finish the game
he played most illogically his next move should have been the rook
yore relieved mister alden
acknowledged mister mitchell
screen on
screen on sir approaching galaxy edge sir
neutralise warp mister mitchell hold this position
neutralise warp sir
address intercraft
intercraft open
this is the captain speaking the object we encountered is ship disaster recorder apparently ejected from the valiant two hundred years ago
the tapes are burnt out trying the memory banks
we hope to learn from the recorder what the valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel we ll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers all decks stand by
department heads sir you wanted everybody on the bridge before we left the galaxy jones
the name smith sir
astro sciences standing by captain
engineering division ready as always
life sciences ready sir this is doctor dehner who joined the ship at the aldebaran colony
psychiatry captain my assignment is to study crew reaction in emergency conditions
getting something from the recorder now
lf there was an emergency be interested in how that crew reacted too
improving the breed doctor is that your line
heard that more your specialty commander line included
to kelso walking freezer unit
decoding memory banks ll try to interpolate the valiant had encountered magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction
the old impulse engines weren strong enough
swept past this point about half light year out of the galaxy they were thrown clear turned and headed back into the galaxy here not getting it all the tapes are pretty badly burned sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force now orders counter orders repeated urgent requests for information from the ship computer records for anything concerning esp in human beings
extrasensory perception doctor dehner how are you on esp
in tests ve taken my esp rated rather high
asking what you know about esp
it is fact that some people can sense future happenings read the backs of playing cards and so on but the esper capacity is always quite limited
severe damage seven crewmen dead no make that six one crewman seemed to have recovered that when they became interested in extrasensory perception more than interested almost frantic about it no this must be garbled get something about destruct must have read it wrong it sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship
comments
the only fact we have for sure is that the valiant was destroyed
that probably the best argument to continue the probe other vessels will be heading out here someday and they ll have to know what they ll be facing we re leaving the galaxy mister mitchell ahead warp factor one
force field of some kind
we re coming up on it fast
sensor beam on
sensor beam on sir
deflectors full intensity
deflectors full intensity
deflectors say there something there sensors say there isn density negative radiation negative energy negative
whatever it is contact in twelve seconds
gravitation on automatic consoles blow up emergency stations all decks on fire alert neutralise controls kelso put it on manual any radiation anything
negative
helmsmen take us out of here dehner gets hit by an electric charge then mitchell helmsmen kirk takes controls lateral power spock takes over enterprise veers away take damage reports
damage control reports all stations
something hit me like an electrical charge
he alive appears to be in shock
main engines are out sir we re on emergency power cells casualties nine dead conditions
gary gary are you all right
little weak for some reason jim but feel all right now opens eyes they re glowing captain log star date 1312 ship condition heading back on impulse power only main engines burned out the ship space warp ability gone earth bases which were only days away are now years in the distance our overriding question now is what destroyed the valiant they lived through the barrier just as we have what happened to them after that
autopsy report sir each case showed damage to the body neural circuit an area of the brain was burned out
and you are you feeling all right
yes mitchell too except for his eyes we re trying to find reason for that now and why out of our whole crew only certain people were affected
think we ve found that answer doctor
you mentioned that tests show you have high degree of extrasensory perception so do the records of the others gary mitchell has the highest esper rating of all
lf you re suggesting there anything dangerous
before the valiant was destroyed its captain was frantically searching for esp information on his crew
espers are simply people with flashes of insight
are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects cause fires to start spontaneously
there nothing about it that could possibly make person dangerous
doctor dehner is speaking of normal esp power
perhaps you know of another kind
do we know for sure doctor that there isn another kind
without looking hello jim hey you look worried
ve been worried about you ever since that night on deneb iv
yeah she was nova that one not nearly as many after-effects this time except for the eyes they kind of stare back at me when shaving
do you feel any different
well in way feel better than ve ever felt before in my life actually seems to have done me some good
how
well getting chance to read some of that longhair stuff you like hey man remember you back at the academy stack of books with legs the first thing ever heard from an upperclassman was watch out for lieutenant kirk in his class you either think or sink
wasn that bad was
if hadn aimed that little blonde lab technician at you
you what you planned that
well you wanted me to think didn you outlined her whole campaign for her
almost married her
better be good to me getting even better ideas here
looks at monitor you spinoza
once you get into him he rather simple though childish almost don agree with him at all
go on
hey trying to tell you feel fine when do go back on duty
going to ask doctor dehner to keep you under observation for while
with almost hundred women on board you can do better than that friend captain
consider it challenge
that doesn seem very friendly weird voice didn say you better be normal good to me
he reading even faster now than just few moments ago is that gary mitchell the one you used to know
put twenty four hour watch on the sickbay fullest possible range of examinations and tests
perfect perfect ve never had patient like you gary even the healthiest are generally off on some reading leaves
know you don particularly like me mister mitchell but since am assigned here can we make the best of it
ve got nothing against you doctor
nor against the walking freezer unit
well sorry about that
women professionals do tend to overcompensate now let talk about you how do you feel
you know everybody everybody seems worried that don have some kind of fever or something maybe if we could just change these dials sends them soaring now back to normal think
how did you do that
not sure just thought of making it happen and it does it hey er hey watch this doc indicators plummet mitchell collapses
stop it stop it you were dead for almost twenty two seconds there were no readings at all
yeah oh boy you you know doc there have been other things too like going halfway through the ship library in hardly day yeah oh what happening to me
do you remember everything you read that quickly
yeah
on any tape
sure yeah
try this one
yeah
page three eighty seven
my love has wings slender feathered things with grace in upswept curve and tapered tip the nightingale woman written by phineas tarbolde on the canopius planet back in 1996 it funny you picked that one doctor
why
that one of the most passionate love sonnets of the past couple of centuries how do you feel doctor
what
how do you feel
just fell nothing happened mitchell no are you sure are you sure
er was on my coffee break thought check up on mitchell yeah that okay lee come on in don let the light in my eyes bother you pal it all for our our good-looking lady doctor here
yeah sure
so er so how go the repairs
well the main engines are gone unless we can find some way to re-energise them
you better check the starboard impulse packs those points have about decayed to lead
oh yeah sure mitch
not joking lee you activate those packs and you ll blow the whole impulse deck
ll er ll get on it right away just wanted to stop by and make sure you were okay see you later leaves
he fool fool he seen those points and he hadn noticed their condition
how do you know
the image of what he seen was still in his mind
well it didn make any sense that he know but naturally checked out the circuit anyway don know how but he was right this point is burned out exactly the way he described it
sorry late became so interested in observing gary mister mitchell
our subject is not gary mitchell our concern is rather what he is mutating into
know those from your planet aren suppose to have feelings like we do mister spock but to talk that way about man you ve worked next to for years is worse than
that enough doctor
don think so understand you least of all gary told me that you ve been friends since he joined the service that you asked for him aboard your first command
it is my duty whether pleasant or unpleasant to listen to the reports observations even speculations on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel and it my science officer duty to see provided with that go ahead mister spock
have you noted evidence of unusual powers
he can control certain autonomic reflexes he reads very fast retains more than most of us might consider usual
mister scott would you repeat what you just told us
about an hour ago the bridge controls started going crazy levers shifting by themselves buttons being pushed instrument readings changing
and on my monitor screen could see mitchell smiling each time it happened as if this ship and crew were almost toy for his amusement
are they right doctor has he shown abilities of such magnitude
saw some such indications
and you didn think it worth mentioning
no one been hurt have they don you understand mutated superior man could also be wonderful thing the forerunner of new and better kind of human being
mister sulu
if you want the mathematics of this mitchell ability is increasing geometrically that is like having penny doubling it every day in month you ll be millionaire
in less time than that he will have attained powers we can understand and can cope with soon we ll be not only useless to him but actually an annoyance
there ll be no discussion of this with the crew thank you everyone else leaves
we ll never reach an earth base with him aboard jim you heard the mathematics of it in month he ll have as much in common with us as we have with ship full of white mice
need recommendation spock not vague warnings
recommendation one there planet few light days away from here delta vega it has lithium cracking station we may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines
and if we can we ll be trapped in orbit there we haven enough power to blast back out
it is the only possible way to get mitchell off this ship
if you mean strand mitchell there won do it that station is fully automated there not soul on the whole planet even the ore ships call only once every twenty years
then you have one other choice kill mitchell while you still can
get out of here
it is your only other choice assuming you make it while you still have time
will you try for one moment to feel at least act like you ve got heart we re talking about gary
the captain of the valiant probably felt the same way and he waited too long to make his decision think we ve both guessed that
set course for delta vega star date 1313 we re now approaching delta vega course set for standard orbit this planet completely uninhabited is slightly smaller than earth desolate but rich in crystal and minerals kelso task transport down with repair party try to regenerate the main engines save the ship our task transport down man ve known for fifteen years and if we re successful maroon him there
thirsty cup slides under tap is filled then flies through the air to his hand it like man who has been blind all of his life suddenly being given sight sometimes feel there nothing couldn do in time some people think that makes me monster don they jim
are you reading all our thoughts gary
can sense mainly worry in you jim safety of your ship
what would you do in my place
probably just what mister spock is thinking now kill me while you can he zaps kirk and spock with electric bolts
stop it gary
also know we re orbiting delta vega jim can let you force me down there may not want to leave this ship not yet may want another place not sure yet just what kind of world can use
use
don understand it all yet but if keep growing getting stronger why the things could do like like maybe god could do kirk knocks him out
want him unconscious for while dehner sedates him
you fools soon ll squash you like insects piper re-sedates him
energise
can you do it lee
maybe if we can bypass the fuel bins without blowing ourselves up
take him
there not soul on this planet but us
nobody but us chickens doctor
think ve got the 203-r set lee
good alden transport it up with you will you
okay
the fuel bins lee could they be detonated from here
destruct switch guess could wire one up right there
do it
he regaining consciousness
doctor piper want only one medical officer here at any one time the other will monitor him on the dispensary screen
like to stay now try to talk to him
my friend james kirk remember those rodent things on dimorus the poisoned darts they threw took one meant for you
and almost died remember
so why be afraid of me now
you ve been testing your ability to take over the enterprise in the transporter room you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison squashing us if we got in your way
was drugged then
yes in the sickbay you said if you were in my place you kill mutant like yourself
why don you kill me then mister spock is right and you re fool if you can see it
you don mean that gary
man cannot survive if race of true espers is born in time you ll understand that tests the forcefield
gary gary don
jim
his eyes went back to normal
fighting the force field drained his strength for while at least he could be handled now
ll just keep getting stronger you know that don you
having put new panel in bridge station it fits like glove captain rifle we sent down
didn order any spock enters with rifle affirmative landing party out
he tried to get through the force field again his eyes changed back faster he didn become as weak
doctor dehner feels he isn that dangerous what makes you right and trained psychiatrist wrong
because she feels don all know is logic in my opinion we ll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time
direct to the power bins from here you could blow up this whole valley
if mitchell gets out at your discretion lee if sitting here you think you re the last chance want you to hit that button captain log star date 1313 note commendations on lieutenant kelso and the engineering staff in orbit above us the engines of the enterprise are almost fully regenerated balance of the landing party is being transported back up mitchell whatever he become keeps changing growing stronger by the minute
he been like that for hours now
have doctor piper meet us in the control room with kelso we ll all transport up together
if he should try to stop us
kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute think he knows that
staying behind with him
fission chamber three checks out the station seems to be running fine seems to be fitting in place
kind of proud of the job we ve done we re going to be ready to transport up cable loops over his neck from behind and throttles him
you re leaving with the ship doctor
he is not evil
gave you an order doctor
you should have killed me while you could james command and compassion is fool mixture zaps kirk and spock then waves away the forcefield he leads dehner into his cell and we see in the mirror her eyes are like his now
it hit me too whatever it was kelso is dead strangled at least spock alive
doctor dehner
she went with mitchell
don give him pill until after gone it my fault mitchell got as far as he did did you see their direction
yes there was some morning light they were headed across the valley to the left of the pointed peaks there flatlands beyond
when mister spock recovers you ll both transport up immediately to the enterprise
but captain
if you have not received signal from me within twelve hours you ll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest earth base with my recommendation that this entire planet be subjected to lethal concentration of neutron radiation no protest on this mark that an order
it would take almost miracle to survive here
then shall make one behold creates and oasis with flowers and spring you ll soon share this feeling elizabeth to be like god to have the power to make the world anything you want it to be
what wrong
visitor very foolish man you ll enjoy being god elizabeth blasphemy no let there be food kaferian apples whenever we visited that planet always favoured these can you hear me james you cannot see me not there you follow the right path james you ll come to me soon
can see him in my mind too
go to him elizabeth talk to him now that you re changing want you to see just how unimportant they are
yes it just took little longer for it to happen to me
you must help me before it goes too far
what he doing is right for him and me
and for humanity you re still human
no
at least partly you are or you wouldn be here talking to me
earth is really unimportant before long we ll be where it would have taken mankind millions of years of learning to reach
what will mitchell learn in getting there will he know what to do with his power will he acquire the wisdom
please go back while you still can
did you hear him joke about compassion above all else god needs compassion mitchell elizabeth
what do you know about gods
then let talk about humans about our frailties as powerful as he gets he ll have all that inside him
go back
you were psychiatrist once you know the ugly savage things we all keep buried that none of us dare expose but he ll dare who to stop him he doesn need to care be psychiatrist for one minute longer what do you see happening to him what your prognosis doctor
he coming
then watch him hang on to being human for one minute longer
disappointed in you elizabeth phaser rifle has no effect on him ve been contemplating the death of an old friend he deserves decent burial at least grave appears in the rock with tombstone engraved james kirk massive boulder on the cliff above is loosened
stop it gary
morals are for men not gods
god but still driven by human frailty do you like what you see
time to pray captain pray to me
to you not to both of you
pray that you die easily
there ll only be one of you in the end one jealous god if all this makes god or is it making you something else
your last chance kirk
do you like what you see absolute power corrupting absolutely dehner zaps mitchell he returns fire she continues and his eyes return to normal
hurry you haven much time the two men punch and wrestle until kirk raises rock over his head
gary forgive me mitchell eyes glow again
for moment james but your moment is fading they both fall into the grave but kirk leaps out first grabs the rifle and brings the boulder down to entomb mitchell
sorry you can know what it like to be almost god she dies
enterprise from captain kirk come in
captain log star date 1313 add to official losses doctor elizabeth dehner be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty lieutenant commander gary mitchell same notation want his service record to end that way he didn ask for what happened to him
felt for him too
believe there some hope for you after all mister spock captain log stardate 1329 the enterprise in pursuit of an unidentified vessel
there he is sir centre screen still trying to run away from us sir
don lose him mister sulu
no sir
earth ship mister spock
difficult to say captain we re getting no registration beam from it
if it is he ll soon overload his engines
sir he pushing his engines too hard
changing course again he knows we re after him all right
stay with him mister sulu communication
ve tried all frequencies sir he refuses to answer unless he not receiving us
he receiving us alright
approaching an asteroid belt captain schiller rating three five
deflectors on mister farrell
he seen the asteroids too sir
stay with him he ll try to lose us in them
if one hits him
sensor reading on the vessel make it out as small class cargo ship and his engines are super-heating
try to warn him if he loses power now
there go his engines sir
he drifting into the asteroid belt captain
he had it unless we put our deflector screen around him
captain if we try we ll overload our own engines he too far away
cover him with our deflector screen mister farrell scotty spock stand by in the transporter room
aye sir they leave
we re protecting him sir we won be able to hold it long
we re overloading captain engine temperatures climbing danger line farrell our deflector screen weakening sir we can protect them much longer lights flicker
that was one of our lithium crystal circuits sir
bridge to transporter room if you don start beaming that crew over soon onto sulu lights go out again another circuit sir
getting distress signal call from them sir
scotty we re getting distress signal
we re locked onto something captain
meaning no ingratitude gentlemen but just where is it find meself
you re aboard the enterprise
it really darn beautiful ship isn it really beautiful ship oh the name gentlemen is walsh captain leo walsh
how many more in your crew
just few more
your vessel breaking up man if we don get them over here right now
we couldn be sure you was friendly vessel now could we ah but the three will be in position about by now
another lithium circuit now supplementing with battery power sir
scotty how many of them did you get aboard
what wrong
don know sir with those three lithium crystals gone
it ll take longer on battery power
never trusted this
there she goes
asteroid hit him dead centre has been hit by an asteroid it gone did you get the crew off
not yet sir but we ve hooked onto something three women beam in the men are transfixed
it all right darlings we re in good hands
bridge to transporter room
we re clearing the asteroid belt now captain
deflector screen down mister farrell save the power reading me or not mister scott bridge to transporter room how many did we get off
oh er four in all sir immediately correction
want him there whether he can walk or not kirk out
that fellow sounded mite upset didn he
yes yes they are
curious you re certain this was everyone aboard mister walsh no other crewmen
oh no that everyone all right but so far as the ladies actually being the crew
you can explain that to the captain the group leave
amen to that scotty
ah sure these starships are really something marvellous but men will always be men no matter where they are eh mister you ll never take that out of them
deck twelve
you re part vulcanian aren you ah well then pretty face doesn affect you at all does it that is unless you want it to you can save it girls this type can turn himself off from any emotion
apologise for what he said sir he used to buying and selling people
ll handle the conversation darling
come
the commander of the transport to see you captain
good now if you don mind telling
hello
and the ladies is this your crew captain
well no captain this is me cargo captain log stardate 1329 we ve taken aboard from unregistered transport vessel its captain and and three unusual females these women have mysterious magnetic effect on the male members of my crew including myself explanation unknown at present
well how the devil am supposed to know this is starship captain here am with cargo of young lovelies strange ship comes up alongside well naturally did my best to evade you and starship captain or no you exceeded your authority when you drove me and mine into shower of asteroids
your name please
walsh leo walsh you destroyed me ship captain
mister walsh convening ship hearing on your actions mister spock will supply you with any legal information you may need for your defence
you re hard-nosed one captain
and you re liar mister walsh think we both understand each other security escort mister walsh to his quarters confine him there
you re on duty johnny-o back to reality
you can feel their eyes when they look at you like something grabbing hold of you did you notice that
noticed how noticed come on johnny
we ve got trouble mister spock
well aware of that mister scott
one lithium crystal left and that with hairline split at the base
better rig by-pass circuit
can we blew the whole converter assembly
needed on the bridge captain
harry where were you
shh calm down now darlings would you mind waiting outside
sorry sir
well now answer every question they put to you don lie well you ve no need to have you and don submit to med that is being so healthy they ve no need for medical exam have they
what if they ask about
they won have you no place to go lads
they ll notice we re different
no no no they won just let leo take all the hard questions now don be panicking loves we ll get to
get where we don have ship and we re headed the wrong way harry
leo leo walsh is me name darling don forget that so lovely lovely aren they if they only think lovely thoughts if they smile they ll come out right some which way won they my personal guarantee on that
the entire ship power is feeding through one lithium crystal
well switch to by-pass circuits
we burned them all out when we super-heated that jackass walsh not only wrecked his vessel but in saving his skin
if it makes you feel better engineer that one jackass we re going to see skinned
but it frustrating almost million gross tons of vessel depending on hunk of crystal the size of my fist
and that crystal won hold up not pulling all our power through it
well mister spock
there lithium mining operation on rigel 12 high-grade ore ve heard
location and distance
mister farrell has the course less than two day travel
make for rigel 12 mister spock
rigel 12 mister farrell you have the course captain log stardate 1329 on board the enterprise ship hearing is being convened against the transport vessel captain becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic effect produced by the women
this hearing is convened stardate 1329 on board starship enterprise formal hearings against transport captain leo walsh start computer
state your name for the record
leo francis walsh
incorrect
your correct name
gentlemen surely you re not going to take the word of soulless mechanical device over that of real flesh and blood man
state your correct name for the record
harry mudd
incorrect
harcourt fenton mudd
any past offenses mister mudd
of course not gentlemen simply an honest businessman
incorrect
blast that tin-plated pot
full data coming on screen
if it can read our minds too
it can darling it can just what on the record
offense record smuggling sentence suspended transport of stolen goods purchase of space vessel with counterfeit currency sentences psychiatric treatment effectiveness disputed
mister mudd you re charged with galaxy travel without flight plan without an identification beam and failure to answer starship signal thus effecting menace to navigation
what my tiny ship in this immense galaxy menace to navigation
you re also charged with operation of vessel without master license
untrue have master ticket
incorrect master license revoked stardate 1116
all right well very simply leo walsh who was to be my captain on this trip passed away suddenly well had no choice but to take out me ship me own self assumed leo name out of courtesy to him in memoriam as it were fine fine man alas gone to his reward
destination and purpose of journey
planet ophiuchus wiving settlers
come again mister mudd you do what
recruit wives for settlers difficult but satisfying task
data on witnesses
no data
computer go to sensor probe any unusual readings
no decipherable reading on females however unusual reading on male board members detecting high respiration patterns perspiration rate up heartbeat rapid blood pressure higher than normal
er that sufficient strike that from the record
you see gentlemen just as told you three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men to supply that warmth of human touch that so desperately needed wife home family gentlemen look upon this work as sacred public trust ve devoted me whole life to it
incorrect
well about to start devoting my entire life to it
did these ladies come voluntarily
well of course now for example ruthie here comes from pelagic planet sea ranchers magda there from the helium experimental station
it the same story for all of us captain no men mine was farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to cook for mend their clothes canal mud foot thick on their boots every time they walked in
fine evie fine
it not fine we ve got men willing to be our husbands waiting for us and you re taking us in the opposite direction staring at us iike we were saturnius harem girls or something
that enough evie
the only charges are against mister mudd illegal operation of vessel do you have any defence to offer
only heaven own truth which ve just given you
the hearing is closed mister mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity
and what about us what happens to us help us please all of us
miss mchuron if you don mind
our last crystal sir it gone
captain kirk engineering section reports our entire life-support system is now on batteries
mister spock miss mchuron would you mind mister spock will you contact the miners on rigel 12 notify them that we ll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival all officers leave
oh you beautiful galaxy oh that heavenly universe well girls lithium miners don you understand lonely isolated overworked rich lithium miners girls do you still want husbands hmm evie you won be satisfied with mere ship captain ll get you man who can buy you whole planet maggie you re going to be countess ruth ll make you duchess and ll be running this starship captain james kirk the next orders you re taking will be given by harcourt fenton mudd captain log-- stardate 1330 position fourteen hours out of rigel 12 we re on auxiliary impulse engines fuel low barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet lithium replacements are now imperative the effect of mudd women on my crew continues to grow still totally unexplained harry mudd is confined to his quarters under guard
may come in
why yes please do by all means connors are you finished
was wondering what this place looked like it fascinating
would would you walk past my panel again please
your what
my medical scanner
oh why you re not giving me an examination are you
oh no wouldn trust my my judgment believe me just walk by please scanner heart monitor activates it not supposed to do that
wondered will you be examining the miners on rigel 12
yes if they need it
you haven asked yet are they in good health and all
what oh yes they re in excellent health all three of them
oh three
are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive my dear
no just me
wonder what makes it do that
captain hope you don mind
as matter of fact miss mchuron do
was trying to take walk and just just had to run in someplace you see all your men were looking at me following me with their eyes
yes ll have to talk to them about that they er they don do that ordinarily miss mchuron but somehow in your case and the ladies with you its er
they re probably just lonely can understand loneliness
yes yes er now miss mchuron
suppose you understand it even more having to run huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you
well it probably appears more difficult than it is
hmm read once that commander has to act like paragon of virtue never met paragon
neither have
well of course not no one is but some people try to pretend do you captain
miss mchuron don
oh no oh just can do it don care what harry mudd says do like you but just can go through with it hate this whole thing
just three you re sure
yes the miners are healthy and fairly young
later dear later magda did you get to your communications man
the head miner is named ben childress the others are gossett and benton
and they ve been there
almost three years now alone
perfect perfect three of them and three lovely ladies has harry mudd and lithium crystals my dear are worth three hundred times their weight in diamonds thousands of times their weight in gold
but they ll be down there and we ll be up here circling hundred miles above them
and there guard outside your door harry you can get out of your cabin
no my dears after one more job for you it won be harry mudd that trapped it will be gentleman named james
don like you and not very happy with myself either
well not really surprised ve seen you noticing the captain
we re supposed to notice them oh oh harry don feel very good think it must be near the time
asked for preorbital course mister farrell
preorbital course locked in sir
that the last time giving an order twice gentlemen we re down to battery power and we re low on that
it ll get us to rigel 12 sir but it ll be shaky orbit
just hang us in long enough to get six crystals scotty that all we need
ll get you there
ridiculous what are we running here did you examine them did you examine eve
she refused
well come on you re the doctor what is it is it that we re tired and they re beautiful they are incredibly beautiful
are they jim are they actually more lovely pound for pound measurement for measurement than any other women you ve known or is it that they just well act beautiful no strike that strike that
what are they
you mean are they alien illusions that sort of thing
asked you first
no an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep
don follow you
don either
top space frequency of three nine hands over communicator
rigel 12 rigel 12
well this isn exactly the enterprise my name is harry mudd to whom have the pleasure of speaking sir
power curve still dropping captain
we ll make orbit sir temporary one
lay in computer
we can sustain this orbit for three days seven hours
more than enough time communications have representative of the rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs beam him up first pass over their camp
yes sir
look what happening hair lank skin slightly lined look at my face
give us the pills
what if someone sees us like this
you ll never find them harry and if you do find them you know what they are cheat if you care for someone really care
ransacking drawers frantically for whom evie for kirk you ll find out that ship captains are already married girl to their vessels you find out the first time you came between him and the ship you ll see
going back to what was ugly
can stand myself like this
why did you hide them harry don you trust us
didn hide them girl put them in safe place in case was searched
find the pill harry
mattress yes here ruth and magda devour them eagerly go on eve take it it not cheat it miracle for some man who can appreciate it and who needs it
even burned and cracked they re beautiful destroying them was shame
not at all mister spock the choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man ship come
sir mining chief childress and mister gossett
good show them in james kirk captain of the enterprise this is my science officer mister spock
let get right to business you want lithium crystals and we ve got them
fine authorised to pay an equitable price
we re not sure they re for sale captain we might prefer swap
what did you have in mind
mudd women
if we like them we like to have look at them first of course
right trot them out captain oh and harry mudd either way ve agreed to have him released charges dropped
laughs is there anything else
you ve got no choice kirk you beam landing party down and you won find one blessed crystal
no deal you re long way out in space gentlemen you ll need medical help cargo runs starship protection you want to consider those facts too
come along ladies come along you must be ben childress come on now girls come on
and you must be herm gossett
yes reckon am
one thing ll say for you mudd you re not liar ladies you are welcome
it still no deal
conserving batteries sir half power
told they have only three days of orbit left before they start spiraling in do hate to see you suffering such situation captain but truth is truth and the sad fact is you will deal sooner or later you ll have to captain log transporting down to surface of planet rigel 12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals expect further difficulty from miners
all right childress you ve won now ll take the lithium crystals
when have the time kirk
childress
we re busy mister kirk
we don have the time to spare captain
you got better idea
to eve blows like that all the time you can get lost dozen feet from your doorstep the wind comes up sudden magnetic storm that means the wind will really rip soon
dance with me
would you like to dance
no coughs no sorry guess it must be the dust
that the way it is on rigel all the time cuts in on ruth instead
hey
go away
cutting in
not on me fight starts
what the matter with you
why don you run raffle and the loser gets me leaves
you can go out there you ll get killed
just have those crystals here when get back
eve eve captain log have transported aboard the enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system magnetic storms on the planet surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment search now in progress for three hours eighteen minutes
traverse parallel three and four
checking but not getting much
the storm is ionising the atmosphere captain getting difficult to probe through it
captain this is draining our batteries further if we only had those crystals
but we don didn get any should have found way satisfied mister scott
losing communications with the miners sir magnetic storm seems worse
has childress reported in yet
no sir he and the girl are still missing
sorry scotty how much power do we have left
about five hours sir captain log have expended all but forty three minutes of power ship condition critical search now in progress seven hours thirty one minutes magnetic storms are easing
infrared reading check traverse three grid zero four zero
about eleven miles bearing one two one from the mining company
that ben childress quarters
there heat unit operating in there it could be cookstove
have mudd meet me in the transporter room
mudd
the name of this game
had things where wanted them
ate some of your food so paid with some chores
and do my own cooking ve not laid hand on you remember that
oh the sound of male ego you travel halfway across the galaxy and it still the same song there you going to eat or talk
guess supposed to sit taste and roll my eyes ooh female cooking again ve tasted better by my own hand
well you re tasting some of it now couldn scrape three layers of your leavings out of that pan
you find me well some decent water then talk
well why don you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand blast it clean or hadn you thought about that
after hanging out the pots it might work that solitaire
double jack
the red eight ought to go on the black nine
not in double jack
you re not only plain as an old bucket you re not even good company what the devil happened to your looks anyway
got tired of you slumped
you heard what said you re homely ve got enough in crystals already to buy queens by the gross kirk and mudd enter didn touch her
thank heaven you found her
she been bubbling with gratitude ever since
sit down tell him tell him harry
ah yes well
the venus drugs harry
venus drug ve heard of it but it not just one of those stories
oh it exists illegally
well actually you see it relatively harmless drug
harmless
well what it does is give you more of whatever you have well with men it makes them more muscular women rounder men more aggressive women more feminine and
he gave it to the women before you met them
does that mean the others they really look like she does
mister childress
is that what it means
yes that what it means
what happened to my partners
they ve left for their quarters during the storm childress they re married subspace radio marriage it was fraud they can get out of it
if they want to
why
you can condemn the women
can man goes out and fights almost dies we all almost die we should have but we didn and now that we ve got the good life in our hands you bring us women for wives that
you don want wives you want this this is what you want mister childress hope you remember it and dream about it because you can have it it not real takes the pills is this the kind of wife you want ben not someone to help you not wife to cook and sew and cry and need but this kind selfish vain useless is this what you really want all right then here it is
quite woman eh childress
fake pumped up by drug
by herself she took no drug
swallowed it
coloured gelatin
yes they took away my drug and substituted that
but that can be
there only one kind of woman
or man for that matter
you either believe in yourself or you don all right childress ve gone as far with you as intend to want those lithium crystals and want them now enterprise this is kirk
stand by do beam down search party
no the crystals are here and you re welcome to them
stand by mister spock we re coming aboard with the lithium crystals
eve will stay today at least we er we want to talk
eve
you ve got someone up there called the enterprise
two of us mister spock come on mister mudd
don you think you could possibly by accident arrange to leave me behind here on this planet that would be punishment enough
can do that harry but will appear as character witness at your trial if you think that ll help
they ll throw away the key
that must have been quite talk you made down there ever try considering the patent medicine business
why should work your side of the street
happy the affair is over most annoying emotional episode
smack right in the old heart oh sorry in your case it would be about here
the fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours doctor pleases me no end
course plotted and all systems in operation
engines engaged helm answering
out of orbit sir
ahead full
ahead full sir nervous man has his weapon drawn
who there
enters with lot of men it your relief sam all quiet
didn see thing chief
nobody ever does whatever the thing is it already killed fifty people never realised before how dark it is down here
stay on your toes schmitter keep your phaser in your hand at all times
what good will that do you saw what happened to ed appel when he shot at it how about those other people before the monster got them
sorry schmitter know how you feel but we ve got to have guards
okay chief ll do what can
keep alert if you hear anything or see anything call in somebody can arrive in three minutes
lot can happen in three minutes chief is it true the enterprise is on its way
it coming
you think it could get here in the next four hours
you ll be all right the group leaves and nervous schmitter paces then we hear scraping sound he turns looks and screams vanderberg and the others run back
come on it mere moments but they re already too late
schmitter like the rest of them burned to crisp captain log stardate 3196 distress call from the pergium production station on janus six has brought the enterprise to that long-established colony mister spock doctor mccoy and have beamed down to meet with chief engineer vanderberg administrative head of janus six
all right let assume there is monster what has it done when did it start
about three months ago we opened up new level sensors gave us an unusually rich pergium reading not only pergium whatever you want uranium sirium platinum the whole planet like that it treasure house
yes we re aware of that if mining conditions weren so difficult janus six could supply the mineral needs of thousand planets but what happened
first the automatic machinery piece by piece started to almost disintegrate metal began dissolving away there was no reason for it and our chemists were unable to analyse the corrosive agent
sure there is an answer it simply has not yet been discovered
yes it has don know what this butchering monster is but know what it doing our maintenance engineers sent down to the drifts to repair the corroded machinery we found them seared to crisp
volcanic activity
there is no current volcanic activity on this planet captain
he right none at first the deaths were down deep but they ve been moving up toward our levels the last man died two days ago three levels below this
same way burned
like to examine the body
we kept it for you there isn much left roberts will show you mccoy and the guard leave it isn pretty
do you post sentries guards
of course five of them have died
who else has seen this
entering have
this is ed appel chief processing engineer
describe it
can only got glimpse of it but it big and shaggy
ed shot it
oh you mean shot at it
no mean shot it with this hand phaser
fascinating
good clean shot didn even slow it down well ve made my report to you production has stopped nobody will go into the lower levels and don blame them if the federation wants pergium then you re going to have to do something about it
that why we re here mister vanderberg
you re all pretty tough aren you starship phaser banks you can get your starship down in the tunnels
don think we ll need to mister appel mister vanderberg we ll need complete subsurface chart of all the drifts galleries and tunnels mister vanderberg ll need complete subsurface chart of all the drifts galleries tunnels
you ll get it
examining large globe from vanderberg desk mister vanderberg what is this
it silicon nodule there are millions of them are down there no commercial value
but geological oddity to say the least pure silicon
few trace elements look we didn call you here so you could collect rocks
thank you mister vanderberg we ll need your complete co-operation
you ll have it just find that creature whatever it is ve got quota to meet come on appel they leave and mccoy comes back
the vast number of tunnels won make our hunting any easier doc
schmitter didn burn to death not in the usual sense anyway
explain
well there are only fragments of bone and teeth left but the plant physician agrees with me chemical corrosion almost as if he been thrown into vat of extremely corrosive acid
strong enough to eat machinery
strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of
mister spock
at the mine map ve charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage here here and here if the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed
mister vanderberg how recent are these charts
reentering they were made last year
before the appearance of whatever it is
that right
see mister spock give us report on life beneath the surface within range of our sensors there is no life other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface at least no life as we know it
we can cover tunnel by tunnel on foot we must get production going again we must have that pergium
if we could force another appearance of this creature
when that creature appears men die and as if to prove his point the guard outside the power plant is killed there just vaguely man-shaped stain on the ground and wisps of smoke lead us to neat circular hole in the door he was guarding
too many tunnels we couldn possibly mister spock our sensors can pick up normal life functions at considerable distance but what about abnormal life functions just then the lights flicker and an alarm sounds
something happening in the reactor room
back to your stations look at that he goes through the hole cut in the door
wouldn touch it captain an extremely active corrosive traces may linger they step through carefully
the main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone
the same indication as shown at the door captain very strong corrosive
is there replacement for that
no none it outdated but we never had any trouble with it
spock on board
nothing for device this antiquated captain
without the pump mechanism the reactor will go supercritical it could poison half the planet we can shut it down it provides heat and air and life support for the whole colony
mister spock we seem to have been given choice death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning
pxk pergium reactor no sir we don have any spare circulating pump for thing like that haven seen pxk in twenty years
can you rig one up it vital
well sir can put together some odds and ends but it won hold for long
how long
forty eight hours is better than nothing gather what you need and beam down here with it
aye captain
what happens when it breaks down
hopefully we ll have found the missing part by then
hopefully small chance
we ll have to chief the alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the enterprise dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor they re already screaming reactors closing down life support systems
concerned with my people right here kirk they re being murdered you find that monster and kill it
the missing pump wasn taken by accident it was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor
do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet
it would seem so
but why now mister spock these production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years
don know but there is possibility he goes over to the silicon nodule on the desk
what that
life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds but what if life exists based on another element for instance silicon
you re creating fantasies mister spock
not necessarily bones ve heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order it possible that our phasers might not affect it
certainly not phaser one which is far less powerful than phaser two
all right how about this creature that lives deep in the planet below us at home in solid rock it seems to me that in order to survive it would have to have some form of natural armour plating
it could explain much especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one
but our people have phaser number two
which could adjust to be more effective against silicon
silicon-based life is physiologically impossible especially in an oxygen atmosphere
it may be doctor that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment
still think you re imagining things
you may be right doctor but at least it something to go on mister spock have lieutenant commander giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser number two you make the proper adjustments you seem fascinated by this rock
yes captain you recall that vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at lower level the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature
do they tie in
don know
speculate
have already given doctor mccoy sufficient cause for amusement prefer to cogitate the possibilities for time
short time mister spock we have very little
how it going scotty
well sir it plumber nightmare but it ll hold for bit
it has to hold longer than bit
sorry sir that about the best can do but guarantee it not good enough
answers comm beep kirk here vanderberg office
ll be right there kirk out scotty ride herd on it kind words tender loving care kiss it baby it flatter it if you have to but keep it going
ll do what can sir six red-shirted men are lined up
you will proceed from level to level checking out every foot every opening you are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire phasers will be set on maximum and remember this fifty people have died want no more deaths
except the bloody thing
the creature may or may not attack on sight however you must it is vitally important we get this installation back into production
mister vanderberg may ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon
the twenty-third why commander giotto take your detail go directly to the twenty-third level start your search there
aye aye sir may ask if you have reason to suspect this creature may be on that level
it one of the possibilities we ve discussed to vanderberg want your people to stay on the top level together at safe place
don know any safe place captain the way that thing comes and goes
well gentlemen you have your instructions let get at it the starfleet people walk carefully along wonderfully smooth floors with just the occasional piece of equipment strewn around spock stops to use his tricorder on section of the tunnel wall
mister spock find something
adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon captain interesting
traces
life form captain bearing one hundred eleven degrees elevation four degrees
one of our people
no sir silicon
come on the security team have gradually split up to cover all the different tunnels young blond lad manages scream before meeting his fate
he never even had chance to fire captain
it only been seconds since we heard him scream the creature must still be around
captain kirk what is it
this tunnel my readings indicate it was made within the hour moments ago in fact
are you certain
positive
this tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see our best machinery couldn cut tunnel like this not even with phasers
indeed captain quite at loss then they turn to see their adversary and both fire their phasers at it the shaggy creature shuffles off back into another of its nice circular tunnels and vanishes
gone
disappeared astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly
these walls are hot
indeed this tunnel was cut within the last two minutes giotto and another security man arrive giotto are you all right captain
yes perfectly
did you see it
yes we saw it where does the tunnel go
readings indicate maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction
did you shoot at it
yes we took bite out of it spock picks up the piece of armour they had cut off the creature
it not animal tissue what is it
the closest approximation could come to would be fibrous asbestos mineral captain
then your guess was right
it would seem so silicon-based
summation
we are dealing with silicon creature of the deep rocks capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air
that would account for the tunnels
correct this creature body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive
powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber
and it explains the murdered men
it definitely phaser resistant we had our weapons set for silicon and on full power yet we only damaged it it still lives giotto you mean it impossible to kill
no no it might require amassed phasers
or single phaser with much longer contact
commander pass this on to your men we knew it was killer now it wounded probably in pain somewhere back there there nothing more dangerous than wounded animal commander giotto instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector remind them the creature is wounded
aye aye sir leaves
what is it mister spock
ve run complete spherical check on all life forms radius one hundred miles ve located our men all of them and ve located one creature moving rapidly through native rock bearing two hundred and one and that is all
one creature in hundred miles
exactly captain there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime
then we re dealing with more than one creature despite your tricorder readings or we have creature with an extremely long life span
or it is the last of race of creatures which made these tunnels if so if it is the only survivor of dead race to kill it would be crime against science
mister spock our mission is to protect this colony to get the pergium moving again this is not zoological expedition maintain constant reading on the creature if we have to we ll use phasers to cut our own tunnels we ll try to surround it sorry mister spock but afraid the creature must die
see no alternative myself captain it merely seems pity the search team is gathering in the main tunnel
good giotto now has seven red-shirts with him
so it is wounded and therefore twice as dangerous stay in pairs if you see it concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head concentrate it maintain it it is definitely resistant but it can be hurt and if it can be hurt it can be killed mister spock
gentlemen if you ll examine your charts please last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one this particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it and possibly capture it
your orders are shoot to kill protect yourself at all times commander giotto disperse your search parties
aye aye sir louis vinci take your men out the red-shirts leave
mister spock capture it don recall giving any such order
you did not sir merely thought that if the opportunity arose
will lose no more men the creature will be killed on sight and that the end of it
very well sir
mister spock want you to assist scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump
ii beg your pardon sir
you heard me it vital that we keep that reactor in operation your scientific knowledge
is not needed there sir mister scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than do you re aware of that
mister spock you are second in command this will be dangerous hunt either one of us by himself is expendable both of us are not
captain there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search against one creature the odds against you and both being killed are 228 to
228 to those are pretty good odds mister spock
and they are of course accurate captain
of course well hate to use the word but logically with those kind of odds you might as well stay but please stay out of trouble mister spock
that is always my intention captain communicator beeps
kirk here up the ghost it couldn stand the strain
can you fix it again
negative captain it gone for good
start immediate evacuation of all colonists to the enterprise
not all of them captain and some of my key personnel are staying
we haven enough phasers for you
then we ll use clubs we re not being chased away from here we re staying
good get everybody else aboard the enterprise the fewer people we have breathing the air down here the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out how much longer scotty
the reactor will go super-critical in about ten hours sir you have that long to find the mechanism
we ll do our best start feeding us constant status reports scotty vanderberg you and your crew assemble at level twenty three checkpoint tiger kirk out vanderberg appel and three others are there
team up with the enterprise security personnel they re better armed than you keep someone in sight at all times vanderberg take two men go through that tunnel there rendezvous with commander giotto appel and the rest of the men go through there and tie up with lieutenant osborne detail mister spock and will control the operation from central point that all the miners leave
mister spock
captain we are being watched
are you sure intuition
no sir we re being watched they start to move through the tunnels
captain fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels
the chart says both of these tunnels converge few thousand yards further you take the left ll take the right
should we separate
two tunnels two of us we separate kirk walks off down real tunnel while spock has to hunch down to move through one of the new circular tunnels further on kirk tunnel becomes circular too then it opens into an area with flat floor equipment and silicon nodules
mister spock
yes captain
ve found whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours hundreds of them
be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them
explain we see something move roof support and rocks fall near kirk
captain are you all right jim jim
yes mister spock all right we seem to have had cave-in
could phaser you out down the rest of the wall
besides it isn necessary the chart said the tunnels meet further on
very well but find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse please proceed with extreme caution shall quicken my pace
very well mister spock ll meet you at the other end just then part of the wall vanishes and their strange adversary emerges the pair have stand off with the creature approaching when kirk lowers his phaser and backing off when he raises it the communicator beeps
kirk here
captain just read some fresh signs lifeform reading
it not necessary mister spock know exactly where the creature is
where captain
ten feet away from me
kill it captain quickly
it not making any threatening moves spock
you don dare take the chance captain
thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive captured if possible
jim your life is in danger you can take the risk
it seems to be waiting
remind you it proven killer on my way spock out
sitting down well what do we do just talk it over the creature turns to show it wound from their last encounter
well you can be hurt can you we just sit here it your move spock comes running in and takes aim
no no don shoot come on over mister spock he does so and squats by the captain
fascinating it made no moves against you
no it seems to be waiting tried talking to it but it didn do any good spock points at pile of silicon nodules
yes they re all through here all over the place thousands of them
yes see
does it means something to you
possibly the answer captain but not certain captain you are aware of the vulcan technique of the joining of two minds
you think you can get through to that thing
it possible
mister spock know it terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there chance
ll try he fastens his phaser to his belt and carefully approaches the worried creature without touching he concentrates for moment and then cries out
pain pain pain he staggers back that all got captain waves and waves of searing pain it in agony the creature climbs onto rock ledge and etches letters into it
no kill what is that plea for us not to kill it or promise that it won kill us
don know captain evidently it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me in my brief contact with the creature mind discovered it is highly intelligent extremely sophisticated animal in great pain of course because of its wound but not reacting at all like wounded creature it calls itself horta
horta horta mister spock we need that retardation mechanism you must re-establish communications with it
captain it has no reason to give us the device and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet
yes aware of that if we could only win its confidence doctor mccoy this is captain kirk
grab your medical kit and come down here on the double ve got patient for you
never mind just come down to the twenty third level you ll be led to us by tricorder readings kirk out
jim remind you that this is silicon-based form of life doctor mccoy medical knowledge will be totally useless
he healer let him heal mister spock you must re-establish communications want to know why it suddenly took to murder
to obtain that kind of communication captain it will be necessary to touch it
we ve seen how the creature destroys kirk stands ready with his phaser as spock carefully places his hands on the quivering horta
lieutenant commander giotto
perfectly all right where are you
we re at the end of the tunnel mister vanderberg and his men are here and they re pretty ugly shall let them through
under no circumstances allow them in here yet the minute doc mccoy gets there send him through
aye aye sir
murder of thousands devils eternity ends the chamber of the ages the altar of tomorrow murderers stop them kill strike back monsters mccoy runs in
what in the name of what is spock doing
it wounded badly you ve got to help it
help that
go take look mccoy kneels by the wound and gets out his tricorder
the end of life murderers
you can be serious that thing is virtually made out of stone
help it treat it
doctor not bricklayer
you re healer there patient that an order mister spock tell it we re trying to help the mechanism
understood it is the end of life eternity stops go out into the tunnel to the chamber of the ages cry for the children walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow sorrow for the murdered children the thing you search for is there go go sadness sadness for the end of things go into the tunnel there is passageway quickly quickly kirk heads off down the tunnel the horta came out of
the captain said for you to wait here and here is where you ll wait
that murdering monster in there and we re going to kill it
you re going to stay here kirk emerges into an area filled with silicon nodules both whole and broken
into communicator that right lieutenant just beam it down to me immediately and never mind what want it for just want it now move
channeling the horta it is time to sleep it is over failure the murderers have won death is welcome let it end here
mister spock mister spock spock spock come out of it found the unit in there it in pretty good shape also found about million of these silicon nodules they re eggs aren they
yes captain eggs and about to hatch
the miners must have broken into the hatchery their operations destroyed thousands of them no wonder
there they re coming he knocks out giotto and the miners overpower the rest of the red-shirts clubbing them viciously
all right all right let go
come on
how are you doing doc
ll let you know the miners come round the corner
don fire first man that fires is dead
that thing has killed fifty of my men
you ve killed thousands of her children
what
those round silicon nodules that you ve been collecting and destroying they re her eggs tell them mister spock
there have been many generations of horta on this planet every fifty thousand years the entire race dies all but one like this one but the eggs live she cares for them protects them and when they hatch she is the mother to them thousands of them this creature here is the mother of her race
the horta is intelligent peaceful mild she had no objection to sharing this planet with you till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs then she fought back in the only way she knew how as any mother would fight when her children are in danger
we didn know how could we you mean if these eggs hatch there ll be thousands of those things crawling around down here
this is where they live they digest rock they tunnel for nourishment
and they are the most inoffensive of creatures they harbour ill will towards no one
now look we have pergium to deliver
yes know here your circulating pump you ve complained this planet is mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it gentlemen the horta moves through rock the way we move through air and it leaves tunnels the greatest natural miners in the universe it seems to me we could make an agreement reach modus vivendi they tunnel you collect and process and your process operation would be thousand times more profitable
sounds all right if it will work
except for one thing the horta is badly wounded it may die
it won die by golly jim beginning to think can cure rainy day
can you help it
help it cured it
how
well had the ship beam down hundred pounds of that thermoconcrete you know the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of it mostly silicone so just trowelled it into the wound and it ll act like bandage until it heals take look it as good as new
well spock going to have to ask you to get in touch with the horta again tell her our proposition she and her children can do all the tunnelling they want our people will remove the minerals and each side will leave the other alone think she ll go for it
it seems logical captain the horta has very logical mind and after close association with humans find that curiously refreshing
ship ready to leave orbit captain course laid in
very good mister spock
chief engineer vanderberg standing by on channel one
fine yes chief kirk here
just wanted to tell you the eggs have started to hatch captain is start to tunnel
we ve already hit huge new pergium deposits afraid to tell you how much gold and platinum and rare earths we ve uncovered
delighted to hear that chief once mother horta tells her kids what to look for you people are going to be embarrassingly rich their appearance
well that about it kirk thanks for everything
our pleasure chief kirk out
curious what chief vanderberg said about the horta is exactly what the mother horta said to me she found humanoid appearance revolting but she thought she could get used to it
oh she did did she now tell me did she happen to make any comment about those ears
not specifically but did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all didn have the heart to tell her that only have
she really liked those ears
captain the horta is remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature with impeccable taste
because she approved of you
really captain my modesty
does not bear close examination mister spock suspect you re becoming more and more human all the time
captain see no reason to stand here and be insulted
ahead warp factor two on stage velvet-clad arm raises bloody knife then plunges it again into his sleeping victim the audience are rapt
interesting an arcturian macbeth
man with an eyepatch watch him watch macbeth
as lady is he dead speak is king duncan dead
will all great neptune ocean wash this blood clean from my hands
that voice he back that man on the stage certain of it that kodos the executioner
pluck out mine eyes captain log star date 2817 starship enterprise diverted from scheduled course purpose to confirm discover by doctor thomas leighton of an extraordinary new synthetic food which would totally end the threat of famine on cygnia minor nearby earth colony
you mean to tell me you ve called me three light years off my course just to accuse an actor of being kodos
he is kodos sure of it
you said you discovered new food concentrate what am supposed to put in my log that you lied that you diverted starship with false information you re not only in trouble you ve put me in trouble too
did it to trap kodos
kodos is dead
is he is anyone sure body burned beyond recognition
tom the authorities closed the book on that case years ago
then let reopen it jim four thousand people were butchered
martha you tell him
can tell him anything jim he been like this since the company of actors arrived
kodos is dead satisfied of that
well not remember him that voice the bloody thing he did he turns his head to reveal it not just an eyepatch but covering over half his face
jim jim need your help there were only eight or nine of us who actually saw kodos was one you were another if he to be exposed
he dead
then it will be ghost martha and receive in our home tonight invited the entire company to cocktail party have to be sure
and have to get back to my ship and figure out how going to enter all this in my log tom martha

good empirical research scientist steady reputable occasionally brilliant
with very long memory
have no information on that captain we are ready to leave orbit
we ll delay departure for time beaming back down to the planet the cocktail party is in full swing in the main room and martha is bringing another tray of drinks for her guests
where tom
he went to town he called he on his way back the lovely young blonde lenore karidian enters and kirk beams
the others are on the patio
take it you re the welcoming committee referring to his glass is that for me
why not saw your performance today may extend my appreciation
my father will be delighted mister mister
captain james kirk starship enterprise
we are honoured
had hoped to meet your father here tonight personally
sorry captain kirk he has rigid rule about that he never sees anyone personally and he never attends parties
an actor turning away his admirers very unusual
karidian is most unusual man you saw macbeth that was my father
then ll talk to lady macbeth they sit
so captain of the enterprise interesting
so lady macbeth interesting what your next move
we play two performances at benecia if the astrai queen can get us there
she good ship takes glass from passing tray thank you you were very impressive as lady macbeth
thank you and as lenore karidian
very impressive lenore like to see you again
you mean professionally
not necessarily
think like that unfortunately we must keep schedule
you don have schedule now do you
you mean leave but ve only just arrived kirk; so have
and you hate to overstay welcome
exactly
why not
good ll make our apologies to our hostess ll meet you outside meandering between rocks and scrubby trees arm in arm kirk; tired of walking
no just thinking
about what
at the party you were such brash young man kirk; and now
now somehow different not ship captain with all those people to be strong and confident in front of you know you re really very dear aren you in some ways very lonely but just as their lips are about to meet kirk spots body among the rocks and goes to investigate
it tom leighton he dead tom body is laid out on the couch and martha covers it
at least he has peace now he never really had that before oh why was tom killed if what he suspected wasn true
don know ll try and find out
oh jim how ll miss him bursts into tears and leaves
kirk to enterprise
put me through to captain jon daily of the astrai queen on orbit station and put it on scramble kirk; jon jim kirk
can you do me favour
don make your pick-up here
ll pick them up and if there any trouble it ll be my responsibility
just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks over and out kirk to enterprise
transporter room ready to beam up
ready to resume course captain
think we re due for pick-up
what kind personnel cargo
captain miss karidian has been transported aboard ship she requests permission to see you
tell her to come up to the bridge lieutenant
how did you know this lady was coming aboard
the captain
captain kirk didn think we be meeting again so soon
you probably wouldn believe me if told you arranged it
no but it delightful thought captain afraid we need your help we ve been stranded it seems that our transportation has cancelled out on us
can you make other arrangements
yes but not in time you see our schedule is like chain one break and it all collapses
it be shame if that happened
if ever we needed good samaritan
well
appeal to you spock eyebrow hits the ceiling
the regulations are very clear about taking on passengers
ll make bargain with you captain
what have you got to trade
special performance for the crew in exchange for lift
you make it sound very interesting the crew has been on patrol for long time they could use break in the monotony
then you ll do it
you ve got me backed into corner the men would never forgive me if deprived them of your performance and your presence
thank you captain eternally grateful ll get the company ready this means so much to them
mister spock prepare to leave orbit as soon as the karidian company is aboard the ship lenore and her escort enter the turbolift
may inquire as to our course captain
benecia colony
benecia colony is eight light years off our course
if my memory needs refreshing mister spock ll ask you for it in the meantime follow my orders captain log stardate 2818 there are many questions in my mind too many perhaps about the actor karidian and his daughter for personal reasons almost afraid to learn the answers
mister spock eta the benecia colony
we ll arrive stardate 2825 captain approximately fifteen hundred benecia time kirk goes over to spock station and throws few switches

captain
lieutenant kevin riley in communications wish to have him transferred down to the engineering decks
he came up from engineering captain
sending him back
any explanation he fine young officer he bound to consider this transfer disciplinary action
don wish to discuss it mister spock please follow my orders
mister spock the man on top walks lonely street the chain of command is often noose
spare me your philosophical metaphors doctor the captain is acting strangely asking if you ve noticed
negative did you know this is the first time in week ve had time for drop of the true would you care for drink mister spock
my father race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol
now know why they were conquered what are you so worried about anyway find jim generally knows what he doing
it was illogical for him to bring those players aboard
illogical did you get look at that juliet that pretty exciting creature of course your personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl
it occurred dismissed it
you would
did you know that he suddenly transferred lieutenant riley to engineering
lots of things go on around here that don know mister spock now he the captain he can transfer whoever he pleases you can look that up in hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere all right come on have drink
no thank you
you re welcome but will and please mister spock if you won join me don disapprove of me at least not until you ve tried it huh lenore is getting personal tour of the ship
this is the observation deck that the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft
interesting
isn it
tell me captain kirk
anything
did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion
if had ordered soft lights also have arranged for music and flowers unfortunately it isn so on the enterprise we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible
star light star bright wish may wish might do you remember that captain
it very old
almost as old as the stars themselves and this ship all this power surging and throbbing yet under control are you like that captain all this power at your command yet the decisions that you have to make
come from very human source
are you captain human
you can count on it
tell me about the women in your world captain
rather talk about you you must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act when was that
in the beginning
tell me about it
that not fair you haven answered my question about the women
what would you like to know
has the machine changed them made them just people instead of women
worlds may change galaxies disintegrate but woman always remains woman

will continue doctor according to our library banks it started on the earth colony of tarsus four when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed there were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food and that was when governor kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law
ve heard of it
you may not have heard it all kodos began to separate the colonists some would live be rationed whatever food was left the remainder would be immediately put to death apparently he had his own theories of eugenics
unfortunately he wasn the first
perhaps not but he was certainly among the most ruthless to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not using his own personal standards and then to implement his decision without mercy children watching their parents die whole families destroyed over four thousand people they died quickly without pain but they died relief arrived but too late to prevent the executions and kodos there never was positive identification of his body
what has karidian to do with it
his history begins almost to the day where kodos disappeared
you think jim suspects he kodos
he better there were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre who actually seen kodos with their own eyes jim kirk was one of them with the exception of riley and captain kirk every other eye witness is dead and my library computer shows that wherever they were on earth on colony or aboard ship the karidian company of players was somewhere near when they died
it unbelievable there just one officer on duty and he hasn touched the meal lying on plate nearby
hey rec room somebody
larry matson here is that you riley
not me am down in the engineering room
maybe so whatever ve done they re sure keeping it secret from me to her
think his heart is sore
what can do for you riley
song make it love song just something to reassure me not the only living thing left in the universe huh
well you re not and ll prove it to you sings the skies are green and glowing where my heart is where the scented lunar flower is growing somewhere beyond the stars beyond antares as riley listens we see shadow moving
ll be back though it takes forever forever is just day forever is just another journey something gets squirted into riley milk
where my heart is riley reaches for his tray where my love eternal is waiting somewhere beyond the stars beyond antares he drinks
how you like that riley but riley is sweating and choking
help me please he collapses
you ve got to pull him through
not sure can
if he dies the only one who ll be able to identify kodos is the captain and he ll be the next target captain log stardate 2819 ship officer riley condition worsening doctor mccoy making lab analysis to determine cause and antidote entire crew deeply concerned
as of this date lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship
someone tried to poison him
tetralubisol us milky substance someone could have gotten careless made mistake
don believe that and neither do you want the captain to see that report
when ve finished logging it
now
come
my report on lieutenant riley
will he make it
he got good chance
can we predict the same for you captain
all right mister spock let have it
lieutenant riley was witness so were you
all right
someone tried to kill him
could have been an accident
you should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness doctor checked with the library computer just as you did got the same information
aren you getting little out of line mister spock my personal business
is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship
you think that happened
it could happen
don like anyone meddling in my private affairs not even my second in command
jim spock simply trying
know what he doing and don like it
it his job and you know it
and you also know that nothing is proven
even in this corner of the galaxy captain two plus two equals four almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you why do you invite death
not interested in justice
are you are you sure it not vengeance
no not sure wish was ve done things ve never done before ve placed my command in jeopardy from here on ve got to determine whether or not karidian is kodos
he is
you sound certain wish could be before accuse man of that ve got to be saw him once twenty years ago men change memory changes look at him now he an actor he can change his appearance no logic is not enough ve got to feel my way make absolutely sure
what if you decide he is kodos what then do you play god carry his head through the corridors in triumph that won bring back the dead jim
no but they may rest easier scene break during which mccoy apparently leaves
logic captain doctor leighton was murdered while the karidian company was on planet now an attempt has been made against riley while the company is on board the enterprise
doc isn sure it was murder attempt besides have an idea may prove
shh listen do you hear it that low hum
phaser
on overload starts searching
this is the captain there phaser on overload in my quarters if it blows it ll take out the entire deck evacuate all personnel in this quadrant double red alert now starts searching himself you get out of here
you can stay
go on block off this section hurry ll find it
evacuate this section seal it off clear section c4 and c5 in kirk quarters the noise gets louder and finally he sees the phaser silhouetted against the red alert light high in bulkhead he gets it dashes into the corridor and drops it into convenient pressure waste disposal unit directly opposite spock returns in time for the bang that throws them against the opposite wall
barging in without knocking we re overdue for our talk aren we
hoped you would have respected my privacy captain
moment ago we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship before that someone tried to poison one of my crewmen
am sorry to hear that
sure you are are you kodos asked you question
do you believe that am
do
then am kodos if it pleases you to believe so am an actor play many parts
you re an actor now what were you twenty years ago
younger captain much younger
so was but remember let see if you do read this into that communicator on the wall it will be recorded and compared to piece of kodos voice film we have in our files the test is virtually infallible it will tell us whether you re karidian or kodos the executioner switches on comm ready for voice test disguising your voice will make no difference
reading the revolution is successful but survival depends on drastic measures your continued existence represents threat to the well-being of society stops looking at the paper your lives means slow death to the more valued members of the colony therefore have no alternative but to sentence you to death your execution is so ordered signed kodos governor of tarsus four
remember the words wrote them down you said them like you knew them you hardly glanced at the paper
learn my parts very quickly
are you sure are you sure you didn act this role out in front of captive audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy
find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate captain here you stand the perfect symbol of our technical society mechanised electronicised and not very human you ve done away with humanity the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own resources
we ve armed man with tools the striving for greatness continues but kodos
kodos whoever he was
or is
or is kodos made decision of life and death some had to die that others might live you re man of decision captain you ought to understand that
all understand is that four thousand people were needlessly butchered
in order to save four thousand others and if the supply ships hadn come earlier than expected this kodos of yours might have gone down in history as great hero
but he didn and history has made its judgment
if you re so sure that kodos why not kill me now let bloody vengeance take its final course and see what difference it makes to this universe of yours
those beautiful words well acted change nothing
suppose not they re merely tools like this ship of yours
there are no previous records to anton karidian prior to twenty years ago
blood thins the body fails one is finally grateful for failing memory no longer treasure life not even my own am tired and the past is blank did you get everything you wanted captain kirk
if had gotten everything wanted you might not walk out of this room alive
captain kirk she enters from the next room
to karidian you better rest now there stain of cruelty on your shining armour captain you could have spared him and me you talked of using tools was tool wasn tool to use against my father
in the beginning perhaps but later wanted it to be more than that
later everything always later later latest too late too late captain you are like your ship powerful and not human there is no mercy in you
if he is kodos then ve shown him more mercy than he deserves and if he isn then we ll let you off at benecia and no harm done
captain kirk who are you to say what harm was done
who do have to be kevin is pacing up and down in the background overhearing what is being dictated
medical log lieutenant riley sufficiently recovered to be discharged but the captain ordered him restricted to sickbay to prevent contact with the passenger who calls himself karidian and who suspected of being kodos the executioner and of murdering the lieutenant family captain log stardate 2819 suspect under surveillance strategic areas under double guard performance of the karidian players taking place as scheduled
on stage tonight the karidian players present hamlet another in series of living plays presented in space dedicated to the tradition of classic theatre hamlet is violent play about violent times when life was cheap and ambition was god two pieces of paper are lined up on his desk
believe we have match captain
but not an exact match mister spock we re dealing with man life no machine can make that decision
in the long history of medicine no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of play riley don forget to but he not there
riley captain kirk mccoy here
riley gone was recording my log about karidian and kodos if he overheard
you ve made your point doctor broken into one phaser is missing
this is the captain security two alert find and restrain lieutenant kevin riley he armed and possibly headed towards the ship theatre the ghost summons hamlet
whither wilt thou lead me speak ll go no further karidian mark me
will kirk comes creeping around backstage
my hour is almost come when to sulphurous and tormenting fires must render up myself
speak am bound to hear
so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear am thy father spirit doomed for certain term to walk the night kirk spots kevin with the phaser
riley get back to the sickbay
he murdered my father and my mother
you could be wrong don throw away your life on mistake
not wrong
but that am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house
know that voice that face know it saw it he murdered them
thy soul freeze thy young blood
it an order give me the weapon takes it from riley
now get back to sickbay go on riley leaves and there is polite applause at the end of the scene on stage karidian comes backstage
it going beautifully what is it what wrong
there was voice out of the past haunting me torturing me there was another part once played long ago never told you about it now that same curtain rises again the time has come
no father the time will never come tonight after my performance the last two who can harm you will be gone
what are you saying
there were nine now there are only two and they will be gone as soon as don look at me like that
what have you done
what had to be done they had to be silenced
all of them all seven more blood on my hands
no father not anymore strong father it nothing
we ll be ready don you see all the ghosts are dead ve buried them there no more blood on your hands
oh my child my child you ve left me nothing you were the one thing in my life untouched by what done
but you re safe now father ve saved you now no one can touch you not even captain kirk see caesar come he awed by your greatness your shining brightness bright as blade before it is stained with blood
bright as blade come with me both of you
of course after the play
the play is over it been over for twenty years
was soldier in cause there were things to be done terrible things
stop it father you have nothing to justify
murder flight suicide madness never wanted the blood on my hands ever to stain you
did it for you ve saved you
by killing seven innocent men
they weren innocent they were dangerous would have killed world to save him kirk takes karidian arm
the play captain he must go on this is the great karidian
guard
you cannot deny him his last performance she grabs the security guard phaser and runs out onto the stage
lenore don
you ll never get off the ship
it will become floating tomb drifting through space with the soul of the great karidian giving performances at every star he touches kirk moves towards her know how to use this captain
no
caesar beware the ides of march
no child don as she squeezes the trigger her father steps in front of kirk and takes the shot himself lenore screams at what she has done and kirk takes the phaser from her as she kneels over karidian body
father father proud death what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou such prince at shot so bloodily hast struck the curtain the curtain rises it rises there no time to sleep the play the play the play the thing wherein we ll catch the conscience of the king
medical report hands it over she ll receive the best of care jim she remembers nothing she even thinks her father still alive giving performances before cheering crowds you really cared for her didn you
ready to leave benecia orbit captain
stand by mister leslie all channels cleared uhura
all channels clear sir
whenever you re ready mister leslie
leaving orbit sir
you re not going to answer my question are you
ahead warp factor one mister leslie
that an answer enterprise is orbiting red and white planet
well mister spock
very typical captain iron-silicon base oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere largely arid no discernible life no surprises
photographic section begin scanning tie in to visual section 988-tg computer bank 22 kirk out about four more orbits ought to do it mister lesley that ll wrap it up lay in course for starbase 200
aye aye captain
captain something suddenly rocks the ship we see shot of nebula along with the crew
mister spock
incredible captain and again
what was that
what my instruments read is totally unbelievable captain twice for split second each time everything within range of our instruments seemed on the verge of winking out
want facts not poetry
have given you the facts captain the entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked the planet below the mass of which we re measuring attained zero gravity
that impossible what you re describing
is non-existence
standard general alert signal from starfleet command captain
all stations to immediate alert status stand by
captain scanners now report life object on the planet surface below
you just did complete life survey five minutes ago how are you just picking it up now
inexplicable captain this reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside
well what is it this object its physical makeup
living being body temperature 98 fahrenheit mass electrical impulses movement it is apparently human captain
and its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out spock; almost to the second
explanation
none
speculation could this being present any danger to the ship
possible very possible
lieutenant uhura notify security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us let go any word comes through from starfleet command pipe it down immediately communications priority one captain log stardate 3087 while investigating an uncharted planet the enterprise and at least this entire quadrant of space has been subjected to violent unexplained stress and force sensors have reported the presence of human being on the planet below who might be connected with the phenomenon with my first officer and security team have set out in search of him kirk spock and four armed red-shirts arrive on rocky terrain with few scrubby bushes they walk on little way until they spot strange craft on the ground one-man flying saucer with perspex dome cockpit as they reach it man calls out from ridge
you came thank the heavens there still time it not too late we can still stop him but but need need your help he falls
nothing yet sir
woman in blue uniform report on the dilithium crystals captain
yes
whatever that phenomenon was it drained almost all of our crystals completely it could mean trouble
you have talent for understatement lieutenant without full crystal power our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours re-amplify immediately
aye aye sir
any further magnetic disturbance
negative captain scanners indicate situation normal
nothing
nothing illogical an effect of such proportions unexplainable by any established physical laws that aware of have been able to ascertain one fact though the effect whatever it was was unquestioningly widespread it was strongest here on the planet beneath us
keep checking
red two message in one minute captain starfleet command code factor one sir
repeat
code factor one
invasion status all hands this is the captain battle stations repeat battle stations this is no drill
kirk here
yes doctor quickly he ll be all right
ll talk to him later thank you kirk out
message ready captain main screen coming up
kirk here enterprise standing by commodore
yes sir in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond complete disruption of normal magnetic and gravimetric fields timewarp distortion possible radiation variations and all of them centring on the general area which you are now patrolling the question is are these natural phenomena or are they mechanically created and if they are by whom for what purpose your guess captain
thank you sir have considered all the alternatives my best guess is it could be prelude to invasion of finding out specifically kirk; aye aye sir can you assign me other starships as reserve and personnel within hundred parsecs of your position it going to be tough on you and the enterprise but that the job you ve drawn you re on your own
see you mean we re the bait
thank you sir transmission ends maintain alert status at all battle stations
aye aye sir
from the top mister spock first the phenomenon came from the planet below secondly the danger is apparently real and imminent
third closer examination of the planet surface would be in order my job sir
yes meanwhile ll talk to our unexpected guest maybe he can provide some answers
that how came to be down there captain pursuing the devil own spawn thing ve chased across the universe he humanoid outside but inside he hideous murdering monster ll get him captain swear it
you say this one man
not man thing
thing destroyed your entire civilisation
to the last man woman and child
how did you escape
was inspecting magnetic communications satellites you believe me don you
before we picked you up our ship sustained number of incredible effects
that was he he death anti-life he lives to destroy
is he the thing that attacked you
yes give you my word swear it
we don have any other facts any information
then you ll join me in my holy cause help me in visiting justice and vengeance upon him
my only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we re on you ll beam down with me and ll check your story out the flying saucer is being minutely examined
spock find anything
negative captain anything from our guest
according to him there creature of some sort down here humanoid
lieutenant uhura communicated that information ordered re-confirmation on our sensors they indicate no living creature on this planet suggest captain that you ve been lied to
captain you yourself said there were no other explanations why do you give credence to this man
fail to comprehend your indignation sir ve simply made the logical deduction that you are liar
let have it the truth this time another one of those nebula overlay events happens and lazarus starts shouting then runs off
no you ve come back in is it well don stop here am come at me again we ll finish it
can you identify that
trying captain
lazarus you stay here all personnel security red
come come it ll do you no good ll chase you to the very fires of hell we re treated to negative image of lazarus suddenly being pounced on by another person they fight as the picture keeps being rotated to make you dizzy then it all ends and lazarus staggers back on the planet surface again
lazarus what happened
saw it again the thing it attacked me
let get out of here
captain readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet almost on this very spot
told you it was thing all white black and empty terrible emptiness
let get back to the ship
he ll kill us all if we don kill him first kill kill kill kill kill captain log stardate 3088 we continue to orbit the dead planet which seems to be the source of the phenomenon which has struck the enterprise and all sections of the galaxy once again as for lazarus the story he tells me about the humanoid continues to trouble me
any luck
negative captain can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than can the first
if there shred of truth to what lazarus said
that single creature humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude
hard to believe
indeed
but the rest of his story seems to fit his wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something
affirmative
assuming there is humanoid something how does he do it he has no weapons no power
captain only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that lazarus has his alleged confrontations
doctor mccoy asking to see you in sickbay captain
don know jim maybe imagining things and maybe not you tell me
you tell me that why you brought me down here isn it
well as you know we both brought lazarus in here and treated deep abrasion on his forehead right
right
then bandaged it stepped into this room for just moment
bones ve got lot of things to do get to the point
well say he got the constitution of dinosaur recuperative powers ditto as we both know bright young medic with miraculous touch why then when returned there wasn trace of that wound on his forehead not even bruise it was like he had never been injured
where is he
don know jim this is big ship just country doctor lazarus is sitting nearby when the following conversation takes place
hi
hi coffee
is that an order lieutenant
know what you mean re-amplification finished on the dilithium crystals
yes ready and waiting they leave then lazarus follows lazarus has some sort of seizure and we get the nebula effect the fight and then he has plaster on his forehead again kirk and mccoy exit the turbolift and spot him
lazarus are you all right
yes but impatient have you decided to help me yet mccoy removes the plaster to show the cut
is something wrong
no have ship physician with strange sense of humour
this is no joke jim know what saw
go
find something
on my way lazarus you re with me bones if had time laugh
main screen on lieutenant
screen on sir kirk and lazarus enter
source of radiation captain bright flashing light on the planet
how is it the scanners didn pick it up before
because it is not there
another riddle first doctor mccoy then you
what mean captain is that according to our usual scanning procedures there is nothing there that could be causing that effect
but it is there
affirmative confess am somewhat at loss for words it may be described though loosely and inaccurately as rip in our universe
what
kind of physical warp captain in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity however with the dilithium crystals was able to localise it
yes that it the dilithium crystals with their power we could do it
you refer to the humanoid
yes we ve got him captain we ve got him
what do the crystals have to do with it all they show us the point of radiation
that just it that the key that the way to trap him that the solution captain beg of you plead demand give me the crystals
out of the question those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship
you fool there won be any ship if we don kill him he ll destroy all of you
how now you tell me how all ve heard is double-talk lies threats accusations that don hold water now you tell me how it presents danger to my ship
warn you captain you ll give me the crystals
don threaten me lazarus
no threat intended captain ll have my vengeance he leaves the bridge by the turbolift and the guard follows moment later lazarus is walking along corridor when he has another seizure and loses the head injury lazarus heads for
lieutenant masters captain calling
masters here ten minutes all dilithium crystals full power we see lazarus jump the engineer out of her sight
ll check sir she goes into the room where lazarus is hiding checks panel and leaves again
captain the chamber will be ready in ten minutes sir my assistant and will lazarus injects her neck with something
captain captain
captain security reports lazarus missing captain log stardate 3088 we are no closer to finding an answer to the strange phenomenon than we were at the beginning not only have two of my crewmen been attacked two of our dilithium crystals are missing and without them the enterprise cannot operate at full power they must be found this lazarus has his head injury back again
fact you said you needed the crystals fact an hour after you said you must have them they were missing fact two of my crewmen were attacked
and fact captain didn take the crystals not the one find my enemy find the beast and you ll find the crystals
how this beast get aboard my ship
he did isn that enough
no he didn transport up report would ve been made
tell you we re dealing with creature capable of destroying worlds
why does he need the crystals for what reason
for the same reason that do listen to me he humanoid why he he can pilot spaceship he can compute formulas to destroy races he can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape from me are you deaf as well as blind
sit down the crystals certainly aren here there an unexplained radiation source on the planet obviously some connection we ll check it out organise search party immediately mister lazarus will beam down with us
thank you captain
you may not have reason to thank me depending on what we find
what do you believe now captain
believe the missing crystals aren in your ship mister spock
unable to locate the source of radiation
why not you had it spotted on the enterprise
it has simply disappeared captain
want every inch of this terrain checked look for footprints movement anything call out if you spot anything don be afraid to use your weapons the entire party leave the little spaceship the starfleet group splits into two and take different lines along rocky outcrop lazarus heads off on his own and has one of his nebula moments there fight in negative space and then it over again kirk sends his two security men on ahead and for some reason lazarus decides to climb down cliff face he dislodges rock and it goes tumbling lazarus calls out then follows it
captain look out
he coming out of it now
the thing the thing
it all right you re on board the enterprise
the rock
how your head
aches
you saved my life down there want to thank you
why shouldn
have some questions want to ask you
not now jim
it necessary
go ahead it all right
this is computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening it calls you liar lazarus for one thing there no planet at the location you said you came from there never has been if you want help from us you better start telling the truth
you wouldn believe me if told you
try us
all right distorted fact in the interest of self-preservation for my holy cause needed help not censure freedom not captivity for being madman was afraid that what you call me if told you the truth
ll have the truth now
my planet my earth or what left of it is down there beneath us
what are you saying
my spaceship is more than just that it time chamber time-ship and am time traveller
and this thing you search for is time traveler too
oh yes he fled me across all the years all the empty years to dead future on murdered planet he destroyed help me give me the tools need to kill him the crystals don let him get away don let him get away
lazarus you re hurt know sympathise but ve got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about now where are those crystals
told you he got them he took them the thing the thing
he got to get some rest jim and would you get that muscleman out of my sickbay gestures at the security guard
dismissed the guard leaves
he in lot of pain
sometimes pain can drive man harder than pleasure sure you know that doctor
well don worry he not going anywhere not this time but once the medical bay is empty lazarus gets out of bed and has quick seizure
what have we got mister spock magnetic effect which produces winking-out phenomenon mysterious unidentified source of radiation on the planet lazarus walking powder keg your rip in the universe so-called murdering humanoid
true captain but more significant to me is the fact that our ship instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe be it energy or matter
but by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet
correct which would seem to be impossible
are the instruments in order
perfect working condition
then what you say leads obviously to one alternative the source of radiation is not from our universe
nor in our universe captain it came from outside
outside yes that would explain lot another universe perhaps in another dimension occupying the same space at the same time
the possible existence of parallel universe has been scientifically conceded captain
all right what would happen if another universe say minus universe came into contact with positive universe such as ours
unquestionably warp distortion of physical laws on an immense scale
which is what we ve been experiencing the point where they come into contact couldn that be described as hole
indeed point out that hole in the universe or in simple container can either allow the contents to escape
or what is outside to enter the invasion that commodore barstow suspected
there has been no evidence of large-scale invasion
but small scale invasion mister spock what is your analysis of the mental state of lazarus
difficult captain one moment paranoid the next calm mild rational almost as if he were two men
yes two men different but identical and hole in the universe no not hole door
through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass
take look at lazarus one minute he at the point of death the next he alive well strong as bull
the cut on his forehead first he has it then it gone then he has it again
which is physically impossible for one man
quite right unquestionably there are two of him
what going on this leaping from universe to universe this wild talk about murdering creature who destroys civilisations what the purpose
jim madness has no purpose or reason but it may have goal he must be stopped held destroyed if necessary
don follow you
two parallel universes project this one positive the other negative or more specifically one matter the other antimatter
do you know what you re saying matter and antimatter have tendency to cancel each other out violently
precisely under certain conditions when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet
like lazarus identical like both lazarus only one is matter and the other antimatter if they meet
annihilation jim total complete absolute annihilation
of everything that exists everywhere lazarus is prowling when he spots high voltage access panel he opens it removes couple of transistors then puts one back to short it out he leaves the area as smoke billows forth smoke starts to come from the main control panels
the energiser has shorted get out of here sound the alarm
come on you too lieutenant
no ve got to stay
we ve got to get out of here the whole thing might blow he bustles her out into the corridor
engineering calling bridge fire fire in the energising circuit hidden by the smoke lazarus enters engineering
fire captain engineering situation critical
all available personnel on the double spock with me two firefighters in protective gear are entering engineering
report
under control sir but it couldn have started by itself
lazarus trick to get the crystals
sir you shouldn be in here
oh didn know he knocks the poor lad out then sets co-ordinates and is beamed to the planet carrying bundle kirk and spock exit engineering
he probably beaming down with the crystals right now going after him you organise security detail follow me as soon as you can
spock to bridge lazarus climbs into his saucer and unwraps the crystals
ll get you now have threshold run run ll get you now
energise
it done it done finished finished it done it done it done it done
lazarus
done no don not you kirk leans into the saucer and vanishes
no kirk goes into that negative space and finds that there is nowhere to run to then suddenly he on the ground on the planet again or is he he walks over to the saucer and is greeted by uninjured lazarus
welcome captain wasn expecting you
no him
yes him you understand
not completely this is parallel universe
of course
antimatter
here yes
and if identical particles meet
the end of everything civilisation existence all gone tried to stop him captain that why took your dilithium crystals
he has two more
that very bad captain if he comes through at time of his own choosing but think if we hurry and you will help me he can yet still be stopped there little time left he meant to come through when you accidentally passed through it drained his crystals it ll take him about ten minutes to re-energise with the equipment aboard his ship that should give us enough time
exactly what did pass through
that hard to explain captain call it an alternative warp it sort of negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel universes meet it sort of safety valve it keeps eternity from blowing up
this corridor is it what caused the magnetic effect the winking out phenomenon
precisely captain but not because of its existence because because my foe entered the corridor is like prison with explosives at the door open the door and the explosives might go off stay inside
and the universe is safe
both universes captain yours and mine
surely lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor
of course he knows captain but he mad you heard him he lost his mind when our people found way to slip through the warp and prove another universe an identical one existed it was too much for him he could not live knowing that lived he became obsessed with the idea of destroying me the fact that it meant his own destruction and everything else meant nothing to him
so you re the terrible thing the murdering monster the creature
yes captain or he is it depends on your point of view doesn it it ready captain if we can force him into the corridor while waiting for him we can put an end to this but if he comes through at time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to find me
understand what do you want me to do
find him force him through his threshold while waiting for him into the corridor and ll hold him there
you can hold him forever
can captain you destroy his ship
if destroy his ship won yours also be destroyed
it will
and your door will be closed
yes and so will his
you ll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever at each other throats throughout time
is it such large price to pay for the safety of two universes
ready
send him to me ll be waiting lazarus activates his crystals manually and kirk vanishes then reappears on our planet and gestures to spock who has come down with two guards
lazarus kirk jumps him while he is distracted and knocks him down
stand back but lazarus has him in bear hug and they struggle together for while until kirk finally gets the upper-hand again
no no no not ready not ready kirk throws him through the threshold
take these crystals to the enterprise
must destroy that ship completely
what of lazarus
and what of lazarus
activate phaser banks
phaser banks activated
stand by to fire the bright dot appears on the planet surface
phasers standing by sir
fire phasers sustained burst hits the little saucer while the two lazarus wrestle in non-space finally it disappears
all right mister lesley let get out of here ahead warp factor one
warp one sir
everything all right mister spock for us
there is of course no escape for them sir
there is of course no escape how would it be trapped forever with raging madman at your throat until time itself came to stop for eternity how would it be
captain the universe is safe
for you and me but what of lazarus what of lazarus
captain we ve reached the designated position for scanning the coded directive tape
good puts it into decoder we both guessed right negotiations with the klingon empire are on the verge of breaking down starfleet command anticipates surprise attack we are to proceed to organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the klingons from using it as base
strategically sound organia is the only class planet in the disputed area ideally located for use by either side
organia description mister spock
inhabited by humanoids very peaceful friendly people living on primitive level little of intrinsic value approximately class minus on richter scale of cultures
another armenia belgium
sir
the weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes
captain the automatic deflector screen just popped on body approaching
configuration mister sulu everyone is thrown about as the enterprise is hit by multiple weapons fire
phaser banks lock on return fire maintain firing rate one hundred percent dispersal pattern
we ve hit him captain he hurt
damage control report to the first officer
captain the other ship doesn register only drifting debris we got him
all hands maintain general alert hold battle stations damage report mister spock
minor captain we were most fortunate blast damage in decks ten and eleven minor buckling in the antimatter pods casualties very light
maintain surveillance mister sulu
no contact captain he blew up all right
well we ve been anticipating an attack say what we ve just experienced very nearly qualifies
yes it would seem to be an unfriendly act
automatic all-points relay from starfleet command captain code one
well there it is war we didn want it but we ve got it
curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want
war or not we ve still got job to do denying organia to the klingons
with the outbreak of hostilities that might not be easy
lay in course for organia mister sulu
aye aye sir
negotiating with the organians will be time-consuming captain and time is one thing we ll have the least of
we won get it by talking about it the trigger been pulled we have to get there before the hammer falls ahead warp factor seven captain log stardate 3198 we have reached organia and established standard orbit no signs of hostile activities in this area
captain unit xy-75847 report fleet of klingon ships in their sector sir
what bearing
unable to ascertain sir
mister sulu have the phaser crews stand by their positions full power deflector screens
yes sir
mister spock and are going to the planet surface you will be in command your responsibility is to the enterprise not to us is that clear
perfectly sir
the klingon fleet is in this quadrant we know that organia will be target if they should emerge
we ll handle them sir
you will evaluate the situation if there is fleet of them you ll get out of here mister sulu
but captain
no buts you ll get to safety and alert the fleet you will not attack alone mister spock and will be all right mister spock let you and pay the organians visit they beam down in front of vaguely castle-styled wall which is completely smooth the locals are dressed in romanticised rural mediaeval-style clothing and take no notice of them at all
you think they had people beaming down every day
yes curious lack of interest notice the ruins in the distance captain quite large
yes fortress perhaps castle
whatever it is it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we ve been given on this culture man in loose purple robe opens his arms wide
welcome
reception committee
it would seem so
you are our visitors welcome welcome am ayelborne
am captain james kirk of the starship enterprise representing the united federation of planets this is my first officer mister spock
you are most welcome my friend
would like to speak to someone in authority
we don have anybody in authority but am the chairman of the council of elders perhaps would do
you people are in great danger is there someplace we can go and talk
oh yes our council chambers are nearby please
captain if you don mind should like to wander about the village and make some studies
of course my friend our village is yours captain ayelborne and four other older men seat themselves at simple wooden table beautifully polished though
gentlemen my government has informed me that the klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it base of operation against the federation my mission frankly is to keep them from doing it
what you re saying captain is that we seem to have choice between dealing with you or your enemies
no sir with the federation you have choice you have none with the klingons the klingons are military dictatorship war is their way of life life under the klingon rule would be very unpleasant we offer you protection
we thank you for your altruistic offer captain but we really do not need your protection
we are simple people captain we have nothing that anybody could want
you have this planet and its strategic location assure you that if you don take action to prevent it the klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises we will help you build defences build facilities
we have no defences captain nor are any needed
gentlemen have seen what the klingons do to planets like yours they are organised into vast slave labour camps no freedoms whatsoever your goods will be confiscated hostages taken and killed your leaders confined you be far better off on penal planet infinitely better off
captain we see that your concern is genuine we are moved but again we assure you we are in absolutely no danger if anybody is in danger you are and that concerns us greatly it would be better if you returned to your ship as soon as possible
you keep insisting there no danger keep assuring you there is would you mind telling me
it is our way of life captain
that the first thing that would be lost excuse me gentlemen soldier not diplomat can only tell you the truth
if you will excuse us captain we will discuss your kind offer
certainly the doors open on their own and spock enters he and kirk whisper in corner
captain our information on these people and their culture was not correct this is not primitive society making progress toward mechanisation they are totally stagnant there is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register
that doesn seem likely
nevertheless it is true for tens of thousands of years there has been absolutely no advancement no significant change in their physical environment this is laboratory specimen of an arrested culture
thank you mister spock that might be useful
we have discussed your offer captain our opinion is unchanged we are in no danger we thank you for your kind offer of assistance although we must decline it and we strongly recommend that you leave organia before you yourselves are endangered
gentlemen must get you to reconsider we can be of immense help to you in addition to military aid we can send you specialists technicians we can show you how to feed thousand people where one was fed before we can help you build schools educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills your public facilities are almost non-existent we can help you remake your world end disease hunger hardship all we ask in return is that you let us help you now
captain can see that you do not understand us perhaps
answering communicator excuse me sir kirk here
captain large number of klingon vessels have just arrived
they re opening fire
yes sir my screens are up can drop them to beam you aboard
mister sulu follow your orders get out of here contact the fleet return if the odds are more equal kirk out gentlemen you kept insisting that there was no danger
that is correct captain there is no danger
ayelborne eight space vehicles have assumed orbit around our planet they are activating their material transmission units
thank you trefayne
can you verify that
negative captain but it seems logical development
captain since it is too late for you to escape perhaps we should do something about protecting you
if you had listened to me
we must be sure you are not harmed
ayelborne several hundred men have appeared near the citadel they bring many weapons
how does he know that
oh our friend trefayne is really quite intuitive you can rest assured that what he says is absolutely correct
so we re stranded here in the middle of klingon occupation army
so it would seem not very pleasant prospect
you have gift for understatement mister spock it not very pleasant prospect at all captain log stardate 3201 mister spock and are trapped on the planet organia which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the klingon empire the organians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for organians
captain our phasers are gone
did you take them
yes captain took them
must ask you to return them
sorry captain cannot do that were you armed you might be tempted to use violence and that we cannot permit you captain will pass as an organian and mister spock mister spock presents problem he doesn look like an organian
vulcan trader perhaps dealer in kevas and trillium harmless to the klingons
they know that vulcan is member of the federation
vulcan merchants are not uncommon captain it is practical approach
what about the rest of you
we shall continue as before we have nothing to fear
you have lot to learn sir and if know the klingons you ll be learning it the hard way the doors open on their own and two klingons march in followed by their leader
this is the ruling council
am ayelborne temporary head of the council bid you welcome
no doubt you do am kor military governor of organia looking at kirk who are you
he is baroner one of our leading citizens
and he has no tongue
have tongue
good you will be taught how to use it where is your smile
my what
the stupid idiotic smile everyone else seems to be wearing vulcan do you also have tongue
am spock dealer in kevas and trillium
you do not look like storekeeper take this man vulcans are members of the federation he may be spy
he no spy
well have we ram among the sheep do you object to us taking him
he done nothing nothing at all
coming from an organian yours is practically an act of rebellion very good to the council so you welcome me to kirk do you also welcome me
you re here there nothing can do about it
good honest hatred very refreshing however it makes no difference whether you welcome me or not am here and will stay you are now subjects of the klingon empire you ll find there are many rules and regulations they will be posted violation of the smallest of them will be punished by death
we shall obey your regulations commander
you disapprove baroner
you need my approval
need your obedience nothing more will have it
you seem to be in command
yes am shall need representative from among you liaison between the forces of the occupation and the civil population smile and smile don trust men who smile too much you baroner you re the man
me don want the job
have asked whether or not you want it we klingons have reputation for ruthlessness you will find that it is deserved should one klingon soldier be killed thousand organians will die will have order is that clear
commander assure you our people want nothing but peace we shall cause you no trouble
sure you will not take the vulcan to the examination room to kirk you come with me will familiarise you with your new duties
and mister spock
you are concerned
he is my friend
you have poor choice of friends he will be examined if he is lying he will die if he is telling the truth he will find that business has taken turn for the worse take him you do not like to be pushed very good you may be man can deal with baroner come with me probably up in the old castle
from this day on no public assemblages of more than three people all publications to be cleared through this office neighbourhood controls will be established hostages selected somewhat lengthy list of crimes against the state kor hands the proclamation to kirk who puts it down on the desk
you do not like them spock is brought in well
he is what he claims to be commander vulcanian merchant named spock his main concern seems to be how he would carry out his business under our occupation
nothing else
the usual certain amount of apprehension regarding us the mind is remarkably disciplined
you are sure
used force four which is sufficient to break down any pretence
very well lieutenant would you like to try our little truth finder
don understand
it mind-sifter or mind-ripper depending on how much force is used we can record every thought every bit of knowledge in man mind of course when that much force is used the mind is emptied permanently afraid what left is more vegetable than human
and you re proud of it
it is tool weapon somewhat drastic but very efficient
are you sure you re all right
perfectly baroner but it was an interesting experience
all right vulcan you may go but you are an enemy alien you will be under our scrutiny at all times if have to warn you
not necessary commander understand you very well he leaves followed by the guard
return to your council baroner you will receive our official notifications as soon as they are published in the meantime keep the people in order it is your responsibility
or will be killed
that is exactly right you will be killed
that mindsifter can be all the terror they think it is
it should not be underestimated captain it reaches directly into the mind we vulcans have certain mental klingon walks past certain disciplines which enable me to maintain shield without those disciplines there would be no protection
ll try and avoid it
out of the way organian
sorry sir we did not notice you
next time keep your eyes open or ll shut them permanently
captain strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem accomplishing our mission here
you didn really think was going to beat his head in did you
thought you might
you re right but as you say we still have job to do
we ll receive no help from the organians
maybe but sooner or later they ll start resenting how the klingons run things if we could prove to them they could do something to strike back to keep the klingons off balance
verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective perhaps more direct approach
that exactly what had in mind mister spock did or did not see something that looked like munitions dump outside of kor headquarters
you did
think it time we did little simple and plain communicating tonight
very meritorious idea captain
we re short of tools
certain the klingons will provide whatever is necessary it pleasure doing business with you mister spock kirk jumps one klingon and hauls his unconscious body away spock primes grenade presumably from the munitions dump
okay so far sonic grenade
with delayed action fuse kirk; good
these crates contain chemical explosives they should make most satisfactory display he casually drops the grenade into box and they run
six five four three there short but bright fireworks show
you were right mister spock most satisfactory display
of course we blew it up deliberately
but that was violence
we did it to show you that you can fight back you don have to be sheep you can be wolves
terrible to destroy
history is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against military dictatorship we may not be able to destroy the klingons but we can tie them up blow up their installations disrupt their communications make organia useless to them
our fleet will eventually arrive in the meantime the battle is ours it can be successful one
captain implore you never to do such thing again
why are you afraid of retribution does your personal freedom mean so little to you
how little you understand us captain
all understand is that you apparently don have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones of course he had the council chamber bugged to you kor and his troops enter
you speak of courage obviously you do not know the difference between courage and foolhardiness always it is the brave ones who die the soldiers hope you will continue to savour the sweetness of your life you disgust me
what are you going to do with him commander
what is always done with spies and saboteurs he will be killed after he has had first-hand experience of our mind scanner
there no need to use your machine on him commander can tell you his name it is captain james kirk
ayelborne
what big grin spreads across his face captain of the uss enterprise starship commander and his first officer had hoped to meet you in battle but
for some reason he feels that he must destroy you commander just as you feel you must destroy him
that going to be rather difficult now isn it captain what an admirable people do you always betray your friends
didn want you to harm him sorry captain it was for the best no harm would come of it
used to the idea of dying but have no desire to die for the likes of you
don blame you captain lock up the vulcan take the captain to my office we ll have talk before do what must be done
you ll have drink with me captain
no thank you
assure you it isn drugged with our mind-scanner we have no need for such crude methods
what do you want from me
oh very great deal but first want to talk just talk
you think going to sit here and just talk with the enemy
you ll talk either here now voluntarily or under our mind-scanner the fact is captain have great admiration for your starfleet remarkable instrument and must confess to certain admiration for you know of course that it was you who destroyed our supplies last night
something was destroyed nothing inconsequential hope
hardly they were quite important to us but they can be replaced you of the federation you are much like us
we re nothing like you we re democratic body
come now not referring to minor ideological differences mean that we are similar as species here we are on planet of sheep two tigers predators hunters killers and it is precisely that which makes us great and there is universe to be taken
it very large universe commander full of people who don like the klingons
excellent then it shall be matter of testing each other wills of power survival must be earned captain tell me about the dispersal of your starfleet
go climb tree
can get what want through our mind-scanner but there would be very little of your mind left captain have no desire to see you become vegetable this friend of yours the vulcan he seems to have the ability to block our scanner think perhaps will find out why will have him dissected your friend killed you mental vegetable not pleasant prospect captain but it lies ahead for you unless you tell me everything want to know twelve hours captain
it will take lot longer than that commander
longer than that will not wait respect you captain but this is war game we klingons play to win take him to the cell with his friend and watch him closely it traditional mediaeval castle cell big iron grills straw on the floor lit by ever-burning torches in sconces on the walls
it no use jim there no way out later
how much of the twelve hours do we have left
six hours forty three minutes if the klingons are punctual
think we can count on them being punctual blowing that munitions dump wasn enough if we get out of here we ve got to carry the attack directly to kor these organians
they do not seem to understand most peculiar
nevertheless our orders still stand we ve got to make some attempt to neutralise the klingon occupation
we may not get the chance captain these walls are very thick
and there are guards every few feet down the hall there are sounds outside then the door swings silently open on it own spock and kirk are ready to pounce on whoever enters
oh there you are gentlemen trust you are in good health shall we go
go
yes your captors plan to do violence to you that we cannot permit came to take you away
you turned us over to them you expect us to trust you now
is there really choice captain offer you safety
we can stay here this is the first place they ll look
they will not come here captain you may believe me
first you turn us in then get us out what are you doing now waiting for the klingons to post reward so you can turn us in again and collect it
how little you understand us captain
nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel
please do not concern yourself about them
what happened to them
why nothing happened to them captain nothing at all
commander
don you see busy
the two federation prisoners they re gone
you mean they ve escaped
swear no one was at fault the guards ten of them were constantly on duty watching the cell then when they opened it to give them food they simply weren there and there was no way out
if you re lying to me
swear
all right lieutenant implement special occupation order number four immediately
sir
is that all you can do smile
you are free captain
want to know how free and why
indeed there are several questions would like to ask as well
this idiotic placidity of yours your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves
we have already answered that question to us violence is unthinkable commander kor the two federation prisoners have escaped obviously with outside aid
they will be returned immediately so that you will know we mean what we say listen
those are klingon phasers take the door get down gentlemen
in the courtyard of my headquarters killed kirk; two hundred of them after that until the two federation spies are turned over to us this is the order of kor
did you hear them
yes of course captain but nothing has changed
well mister spock it seems it up to you and me
it would appear so captain
the federation has invested great deal of money in our training they re about due for small return we have two hours with which to do it in
but only two more organians will die
no no more will die on account of us mister spock where are those phasers
cannot tell you
you ve told us great deal about how you hate violence unless you tell me where those phasers are you re going to have more violence than you know what to do with
you mean you would actually use force
it entirely up to you
ayelborne this is of no matter perhaps you better let him have what he wants he
very well but it will do you no good they re in that cabinet spock gets them but leaves the tricorder
gentlemen have no great love for you your planet your culture despite that mister spock and are going to go out there and quite probably die in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for
there are only two of you against an army don you realise that what you intend to do will be hopeless
come on mister spock let get out of here the doors open politely to let them leave then close again behind them
brave men
yes but so foolish
interesting however
of course we cannot allow it to stop them is very bad
it is necessary they may harm one another
trefayne
they will wait until darkness
and then
terrible inconceivable savage
we will wait outside under cover of darkness and bushes
mister spock can we get those two guards what would you say the odds on our getting out of here
difficult to be precise captain should say approximately 824 to
difficult to be precise 824 to
824 to
that pretty close approximation
endeavour to be accurate
you do quite well set your phaser on stun we re after the top dog not the members of the pack
very good
but if the situation calls for it we kill is that clear
clear captain
ll take the one on the left fire two stunned klingons fall and kirk and spock run into the building
it has begun
very well
it will be hard
prepare yourselves they close their eyes and concentrate
no results commander
nothing
cannot understand these people
they know what death is don they
they do not seem to be worried about anything
bad enough to be military governor but to govern population of sheep very well lieutenant round up two hundred more
yes sir
going into his office fools will have to kill them all the klingons march off and kirk jumps one of them from side corridor getting his belt around the lieutenant neck
if you don tell me what want to know ll kill you here and now is that clear
yes
is kor office down there
yes
what about the hostages talk talk
am to gather two hundred more
to be killed the klingon nods
mister spock spock knocks the klingon out with neck pinch
well what are the odds now
less than seven thousand to one captain it remarkable we ve got this far
less than seven thousand to one well getting better getting better
just stay where you are commander
you have done well to get this far through my guards
taking his weapon believe you ll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition
so you are here you will be interested in knowing that federation fleet is on its way here at the moment our fleet is preparing to meet them
checkmate commander
shall we wait and see the results before you kill me
don intend to kill you unless have to
sentimentality mercy the emotions of peace your weakness captain kirk the klingon empire shall win think of it as we sit here in space above us the destiny of the galaxy will be decided for the next ten thousand years can offer you drink we can toast the victory of the klingon fleet
you may be premature there are many possibilities
today we conquer if some day we are defeated well war has its fortunes good and bad do you know why we are so strong because we are unit each of us is part of the greater whole always under surveillance even commander like myself always under surveillance captain if you will note
cover spock back the klingons burst it then suddenly everyone drops their weapons everyone
shoot shoot they try hand to hand but are unable to touch each other without extreme pain up on the enterprise the crew suddenly leap out of their seats and away from their consoles
what is it spock
inexplicable captain extreme heat not only the weapons but the bodies as well ayelborne and claymare come in
we are terribly sorry to be forced to interfere gentlemen but we cannot permit you to harm yourselves
what are you talking about
we have put stop to your violence
you are stopping this you
all instruments of violence on this planet now radiate temperature of three hundred and fifty degrees they are inoperative
my fleet
the same conditions exist on both the star-fleets there will be no battle
ridiculous
suggest you contact them you too captain your ship is now within range of your communications device
kirk to enterprise come in
captain
can explain it we were just closing in on the klingon fleet when to handle then it all goes dark and he can touch the consoles again
stand by sulu
my fleet it helpless
what have you done
as stand here also stand upon the home planet of the klingon empire and the home planet of your federation captain going to put stop to this insane war
you re what
you re talking nonsense
it is being done
you can just stop the fleet what gives you the right
you can interfere what happens in space is not your business
unless both sides agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities all your armed forces wherever they may be will be immediately immobilised
we have legitimate grievances against the klingons they ve invaded our territory killed our citizens they re openly aggressive they ve boasted that they ll take over half the galaxy
why not we re the stronger you ve tried to hem us in cut off vital supplies strangle our trade you ve been asking for war
you re the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas
they are not disputed they re clearly ours and now you step in with some kind of trick
it is no trick commander we have simply put an end to your war all your military forces wherever they are are now completely paralysed
we find interference in other people affairs most disgusting but you gentlemen have given us no choice
you should be the first to be on our side two hundred hostages killed
no one has been killed captain
no one has died here in uncounted thousands of years
you are liars you are meddling in things that are none of your business
even if you have some power that we don understand you have no right to dictate to our federation
or our empire
how to handle their interstellar relations we have the right
to wage war captain to kill millions of innocent people to destroy life on planetary scale is that what you re defending
well no one wants war but there are proper channels people have right to handle their own affairs eventually we will have
oh eventually you will have peace but only after millions of people have died it is true that in the future you and the klingons will become fast friends you will work together
never
your emotions are most discordant we do not wish to seem inhospitable but gentlemen you must leave
yes please leave us the mere presence of beings like yourselves is intensely painful to us
what do you mean beings like yourselves
millions of years ago captain we were humanoid like yourselves but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies that of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake
captain it trick we can handle them have an army kirk holds him back as ayelborne and claymare transform into pulsating lights too bright to look at then they disappear
fascinating pure energy pure thought totally incorporeal not life as we know it at all
but what about this planet the fields the buildings this citadel
conventionalisations should say useless to the organians created so that visitors such as ourselves could have conventional points of reference
but is all of this possible
we have seen it with our own eyes should say the organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba
well commander guess that takes care of the war obviously the organians aren going to let us fight
shame captain it would have been glorious
you ve been most restrained since we left organia
embarrassed was furious with the organians for stopping war didn want we think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe it unsettling to discover that we re wrong
captain it took millions of years for the organians to evolve into what they are even the gods did not spring into being overnight you and have no reason to be embarrassed we did after all beat the odds
oh no no no mister spock we didn beat the odds we didn have chance the organians raided the game the enterprise is at red alert as an alien vessel approaches them
phaser banks standing by sir
range forty three thousand and closing
what do you read mister spock
configuration unidentified ion propulsion high velocity though of unique technology
any contact lieutenant
hailing on all frequencies sir all languages have been attempted no response now using standard interstellar symbols
keep trying
aye sir
magnification ten mister chekov
aye sir thirty eight thousand and closing
well scotty
it beats me but isn she beauty
interesting design
ve never seen anything like her and ion propulsion at that they could teach us thing or two
life forms mister spock
one humanoid or similar low level of activity life-support systems functioning interior atmosphere conventional nitrogen-oxygen instruments indicate transferal beam emanating from the area of the humanoid life form
directed at what
directed at the bridge of the enterprise captain
security guard
security guard to the bridge woman materialises and smiles at them
captain james kirk this is the starship enterprise the security guards rush in she presses button on her wrist band the power goes off and everyone collapses then the same happens to the crew all over the ship the woman walks over to spock and puts her hand on his head later after the opening titles the power comes back on and everyone wakes up again
what happened
helm status mister sulu
no change from last reading sir
condition reports from all decks lieutenant
aye sir
spock where spock
yes what is it
you better come down to sickbay
all right on my way
deck five personnel no damage spock is lying on biobed with bandage around his head and life-support equipment over his torso
now
functioning
thank god
spock what happened
found him on the table
like this
no not like this
what happened
don know
you ve got him on complete life support was he dead
he was worse than dead
what do you mean
jim
come on bones what the mystery
his brain is gone
his what
it been removed surgically
how could he survive
it the greatest technical job ve ever seen every nerve ending in the brain must ve been neatly sealed nothing ripped nothing torn no bleeding it medical miracle
if his brain is missing then spock is dying
no that incredible vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over his body lives the autonomic functions continue but there is no mind
that girl
aye
what girl
from that ship she took it don know why or where but she must have taken it bones how long can you keep him functioning
can give you any guarantee
that not good enough doctor
if it happened to any of us say indefinitely but vulcan physiology limits what can do spock body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support
then we ll take him with us
take him take him where
in search of his brain doctor from what you say the moment we find it we must restore it to his body or we lose him
jim where are you going to look in this whole galaxy where are you going to look for spock brain how are you going to find it
ll find it
even if you do can restore it don have the medical technique
it was taken out it can be put back in
but don know how
the thief that took it has the knowledge ll force it out of her
if you don find it in twenty four hours you better forget the whole thing jim
you and scotty have spock ready
ve got it again an ion trail matching when we first saw her
where does the trail lead to
system sigma draconis
lock on mister sulu maximum speed
warp six
no question about the trail
no mistake sir captain log stardate 5431 for fifteen hours and twenty minutes we have been following the ion trail of the spaceship that has spock brain time left to us eight hours and forty minutes
captain ve lost the trail
all scanners extreme sweep
aye sir
well
nothing sir
no signal at all captain
it gone sir sudden deaction shift
we ve lost her trail but she went into that system mister chekov put schematic of sigma draconis on the screen
aye captain
read out mister chekov
sun spectral type gamma nine nine planets three of them class possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range scanning
she was breathing our air she must ve gone to one of them show us the three class-m planets mister chekov chekov gets up and goes to the viewscreen to point out the relevant items
the one on the left number three rates letter on the industrial scale
earth equivalent approximately 1485
yes sir second planet class number four rates letter
the year 2030
but that ship captain either it was many years ahead of us or the most incredible design fluke in history
third class planet mister chekov
number six no sign of industrial development at last report in glacial age sapient life plentiful but on most primitive level
now as understand it mister chekov there are three class-m planets
yes sir
not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight
no sir
yet one of them accomplished it
yes sir
thank you mister chekov
captain picking up high energy generation on planet six
that the primitive glaciated planet
yes sir
the source of it
it could be natural volcanic activity steam any number of causes but it very regular
what do your surface readings show mister chekov
no sign of organised civilisation primitive humanoids picked up at irregular intervals
with regular pulsations of generated energy
can explain it sir
can afford to guess wrong ve got to choose the right planet get there find the brain eight hours and thirty five minutes
recommendations mister chekov
sigma draconis three it closest heaviest population
but technological rating of only three they couldn possibly have put that ship we saw into space
none of these planets could
say planet four captain at least planet four is ahead of three technologically
but advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities it be miracle if they had developed it
what would they want with his brain what would they want with mister spock brain what use is it
yes
why do they want it
yes why would they want it eight hours and thirty four minutes planet six is glaciated you say
several thousand years at least only the tropical zone is ice-free
but the energy regular it there it real
yes sir it doesn make sense but it there
have the transporter room stand by taking landing party down to planet six
aye aye sir
hunch captain
hunch mister sulu
what if you guess wrong captain
if guess wrong mister spock is dead spock will die captain log stardate 4351 we are beaming down to primitive glaciated planet in the sigma draconis star system time left to us to find spock brain eight hours and twenty nine minutes kirk scott chekov and two security guards beam onto the rocky planet
suit temperatures to seventy two life-form readings mister spock gets look mister scott
scattered widely spaced humanoid all right on the large side
watch out we know their development is primitive
aye
read out mister chekov
no structures captain no mechanised objects that can read no surface consumption or generation of energy atmosphere is perfectly all right of course temperature high maximum of forty livable
you have thick skin
captain there someone something out there in the rocks five of them humanoid large
phasers on stun want them conscious the group of bearded skin clad males with clubs move carefully towards the starfleet party
fire only on my signal flank out the primitives suddenly leap up from behind rocks throwing stones and their clubs kirk fires and stuns the leader the rest run away
we mean you no harm we re not your enemies we re your friends we only wish to talk to you
you are not the others
no we come from far place we are men
men
like yourselves
you are small like the others
who are the others
givers of pain and delight
do they live here with you
no they come they give pain and delight
do they come from the sky
they are here you will see the others will come for you they come for all like us
do they come for your women as well
women
the female of your kind
your words say nothing
don you have mate
mate
companion
will you take us where we can find the others
afraid no one wants to find them
we do we want to find them take us there and we ll let you go
captain five hundred metres in that direction there foundation under the surface huge one registrations all over the place
buildings
yes sir immensely old completely buried but they were here once
somewhere down there is where the others live scotty see if you can find way down
aye sir
no no no do not go there no no
it all right he struggles briefly with the morg who escapes and runs off
it all right let him go
what could the others do to cause such terror
what was it he said pain and delight
peculiar mixture
dead and buried city on planet in glacial age
and the male humanoid who doesn know the meaning of the word female
over here sir there food in there and whole pile of other stuff storehouse for our muscular friends they step inside carefully
don think so scotty there is pair of photoelectric cells creating an invisible trip wire across the front of the supplies
metal forged tempered our apish friends didn make these what do you think
it could be warning device to keep those creatures away from the food
or the food could be lure set by the others to bring them in here
in that case the beam would be signal
and this cave trap
if it will trap the creatures for the others captain won it trap us too
exactly
kirk to enterprise
have doctor mccoy beam down immediately
mister chekov you and the security team will remain here at the entrance we ll be in constant contact with you
aye sir mccoy and spock beam down spock is in brown overall and has device on his head mccoy is holding remote control unit with coloured buttons he presses one and spock turns left to face us
all right bones bring him along
keep him close to the right
ready he steps across the beam and metal shutter slams down sealing the cave entrance the elevator room drops rapidly
call chekov and tell him to send my stomach down
it might be long wait we may as well be comfortable he uses his phaser to heat rock and they warm their hands in its glow
phasers on stun
captain that power we picked up above we re getting closer
lot of it
enough to push this planet out of orbit
what source
either nuclear pile hundred miles across or
or what
ion power
we re slowing down the door opens and there is woman in yellow in the corridor she reaches to her wrist band but kirk stuns her first he takes her wrist band
is she all right
ll have her talking in minute
you do not belong here you are not morg
who in charge wish to speak to him
him what is him
what have you done with spock brain where ve you taken it
you are not morg or eymorg know nothing about brain
you re lying
she not jim no change in reading she doesn know
to scott see what you can pick up on your communicator
aye
we don want to hurt you what is this place
this place is here
who are you
am luma am eymorg you are not eymorg you are not morg what are you
jim it no use you ll get nothing out of that one hers is the mind of child
captain ve got something but can quite get fix on it luma tries to get away but mccoy grabs her
spock is that you
yes spock yes connected with the hearing of your voice
where are you spock
where else would be
mister spock where are you am
we ll get you spock it won be long be able to get to you
quickly they head off down the corridor scott controlling spock body then around corner comes woman in purple with two morg in uniforms
there she is that the one what have you done with spock brain the woman in purple uses her wrist band to knock out the men only spock is left standing captain log stardate 5431 immediately after making contact with spock brain doctor mccoy engineer scott and myself were taken prisoner inside highly complex civilisation hundreds of metres below the surface of planet sigma draconis seven the primitive creature we encountered above warned us about the givers of pain and delight and the frightening consequences of being captured by them luma and other women are present and occasionally giving pieces of food to the men standing around our landing party are still unconscious and sitting on stools the woman in purple comes in and four women sit at the shaped table she presses the green button twice and they wake up all the men have belts with green buckles on them
what are you why are you here you have something to speak
what have you done with spock brain
we do not know spock
this is spock you saw him on the ship you have his brain it must be restored to him immediately what have you done with it
ah yes brain you spoke to luma also of brain but we do not understand
do not know about luma but you were on the enterprise saw you
do not know these things you speak of
you came to my ship
we know only here below and here above this is our place you are not morg you are stranger
saw you on my ship
jim she may not remember or even really know disassociation could be complete it doesn seem possible she could have performed surgery on spock
no it doesn
you hurt luma it is not permitted again to hurt anyone
sorry we don want to hurt anyone
if you wish to return to your home you may go
no we ll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us
yes for instance above it cold and harsh and below it warm the air is fresh
aye there no sun but there light
wish to talk to those in charge
in charge
yes the organisers the managers the leader of your people
am leader there is no other
that impossible who built the machines
who are the doctors who operates
who controls this complex
control controller
yes the controller the controller who controls would like to meet to see him
no it is not permitted never controller is alone apart we serve controller no other is permitted near
we intend no harm
you have come to destroy us
no no no promise you
we just want to talk to somebody about spock brain that all
brain and brain what is brain it is controller is it not
yes yes in way it is the human brain controls the individual functions
bones scotty spock brain controls
it not possible
great leader great leader he kneels in front of kara we come from far place to learn from your controller
you lie you know me you have said that you came to take back the controller
he is our friend you must take us to him we beg you soon it will be too late
do not take them kara do not take them to the controller
they will be prevented
you must take us single press of the green button and they collapse writhing in agony
must learn what to do to luma come with me you will keep them here
yes mistress the women sorry eymorg leave ship log lieutenant sulu recording am holding the enterprise in orbit about planet sigma draconis seven captain kirk hunch that spock brain is on this planet appears to be correct ensign chekov remains on the surface to act as liaison between the captain and the enterprise
never felt anything like that every nerve in my body was on fire
wouldn believe the human organism could take such pain
these are on to stay for while must be magnetic lock of some kind
no wonder the morgs are so obedient and terrified morg blocks the doorway
how is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we ve met their equipment is laid out on table but another morg stops kirk getting to it
those women could never have set up anything as complex as this has to be why that takes engineering genius but there no sign of engineering genius in any of those women
they were smart enough to invent these training devices what way to maintain control over man
pain and delight he said up above
sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place
yes certainly did notice those delightful aspects but that too was strictly under command of the women
how does spock brain fit into this
with communicator we might be able to find out this fellow is keeping us from our property
isn there way to correct that situation
certainly think that science might provide an answer
it does captain
agreed doctor kirk hits the morg by the table while scott and mccoy take on the one by the door it isn easy but finally the captain triumphs
science will triumph come on scotty bones give them something to keep them out for while into communicator spock spock come on spock spock you were on this frequency spock enterprise
no we might be able to locate you if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for is it medical into infinity
body why you have none
you are disembodied brain oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing apparently pumping blood apparently maintaining normal physiologic temperature
spock we don have time for that
we came to put you back where are you
back into your body we brought it along with us might trust the doctor to remove splinter or lance boil do not believe he has the knowledge to restore brain
thank you yet exist in the galaxy
the skill to remove it exists right where we are restoring it must also be possible that why we ve got to get to you as quickly as we can behalf but must insist they are worthwhile only if there is reasonable chance for success let me ask you how much time has elapsed since
eighteen hours and twelve minutes maximum my body can
told him
that leaves us exactly five hours and forty eight minutes spock does it not
yes very brief that why we must get to you immediately beam us signal so we can home in on you
got it
bones spock body stands up and they walk out of the room
oh spock one question
we ve got pain-giving devices attached to us can you tell us how to get them off they walk along are manually controlled the red button on bracelet releases them know that does not make much sense
oh yes it does spock further along keep concentrating spock keep concentrating spock
must be in there captain kara is in there with her back to the door she hears them enter and gives them pain
jim spock no pain kirk manages to get to the control box that mccoy dropped and get spock body to walk over to kara
no go away spock holds her wrists then finally presses the red button the belts fly off
we will die you must not take the controller away we will all die the controller is young and powerful perfect
you will give life to my people for ten thousand years to come
you ll find another controller
the old one is finished there is no other than this and will not be another for ten thousand years
spock you re in black box tied in with light rays into complex control panel
you say you re breathing pumping blood maintaining temperature is it possible that you re re-circulating air running heating plants purifying water doing
he must stay he must stay
he will not stay he makes spock release her and grabs her himself taking off her bracelet now you took his brain you will put it back how did you do it
do not know
she couldn jim her mind is functioning on very simple level mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use
she was on the enterprise she must have done it how did you do it
it was the old knowledge
how do you get the old knowledge
put upon my head the teacher
what is the teacher
the great teacher of all the ancient knowledge there is transparent helmet with what look like whole lot of syringes sticking through it storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place scan it most impressive store
how does it work show us kara; cannot
you must tell us
cannot only by command of the ancients may understand
how does it work show us we ll protect you mind of the priestess leader its use is strictly predetermined by the builders kirk forces her into the helmet
no the knowledge is forbidden must not know the secret will be punished control panel comes on and she goes quiet
confident assured gentlemen the controller explanation of the functioning of the teacher is essentially correct however he is giving no credit to me provide the means whereby the knowledge is used without me captain
without you there could be no delicate miracle that kept spock brain alive
thank you doctor that was very gracious
yes from the very first appreciated your ability
good captain kirk then you also appreciate that without the teacher would not have the knowledge to use that which you have thoughtfully provided she points phaser at him
that phaser is set to kill
so it is that is the knowledge you have brought me do not move if your weapon kills it will kill you
we re not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing if you continue you ll kill spock
the controller die the controller will live for ten thousand years and we shall give him all our devotion
but spock will be dead his body dying this minute
why do you not understand that the need of my people for their controller is greater than your need for your friend
no one may kill man not for any purpose it cannot be condoned he reaches for the phaser
do not do not know killing do not wish to kill scott groans and faints distracting her so kirk can grab the phaser
the commandment must be fulfilled
you must help us when you came to the ship you had the knowledge yet when we came here you didn
correct
how long does the knowledge last
three of your hours
it would be just enough time
if you had the knowledge could you restore what you ve taken
would not
you must help us you must restore with that knowledge what you have taken
no
you must put back what you have taken
will not betray my people the controller will stay
jim it worked for her it might work for me different it could cause irreparable damage to your human brain doctor
surgeon already if could learn these techniques might be able to retain them
he might but we re sure to lose you if don try
spock didn you hear might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world jim isn it worth that risk wouldn you insist upon taking such risk yourself
go ahead doctor put the teacher on
no mccoy goes over to the device and kirk adjusts it onto his head mccoy winces in pain as knowledge is fed into his brain then falls to his knees
of course of course child could do it child could do it captain log stardate 5432 doctor mccoy is proceeding to restore spock brain our problem we do not know how long his increased surgical knowledge will stay with him any additional attempt to use the teaching device is impossible it would kill my medical officer the top of spock head is concealed by wall which mccoy is working behind
ve never seen anything like it he operating at warp speed like try at that teacher myself
you will have him back and we will be destroyed
no you won be destroyed you ll be without your controller for the first time but you ll be much better off think
we will die
no you ll live and develop as you should have all this shouldn have been done for you now the women here below and the men here above will control together
they will not help us without the pain
there are other ways you ll discover them you must move to the surface you understand
we will die above in the cold
no you won you ll learn to build houses to keep warm to work we ll help you for while humans have survived under worse conditions it matter of evolution you ll be fine mccoy is starting to pause and think
captain kirk
what is it
he forgetting
can
bones bones
all the ganglia the nerves there are million of them what am supposed to do what am supposed to do
bones you can stop now
trying to thread needle with sledgehammer what am supposed to do can remember don remember
bones
no one can restore brain
you could while ago it was child play captain log supplemental our race against time to save spock life may prove futile doctor mccoy has lost the surgical knowledge he obtained from the teacher he has been drawing on his own skills and surgical techniques in an attempt to continue the operation but he is faltering and uncertain in desperate hope that he can draw on spock brain for assistance instructed doctor mccoy to give priority to connecting spock vocal chords
well
he dying and can stop it
hoarse yes doctor mccoy
spock
if you will finish reconnecting my speech centre might be able to help
speech centre
yes that correct one thing at time ah ah mmm normal voice that better now doctor try the sonic separator
sonic separator
yes believe already have some sensation of feeling please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions one by one in each case shall tell you when the probe is correct you will then seal using the tri-laser connector
tri-laser connector ready
ready
right forefinger
twitching correct
right wrist
correct
right elbow
correct very good doctor
ll never live this down this vulcan is telling me how to operate later
closed
well
how do know could have made thousand mistakes sealing nerve endings joining ganglia the fluid balance is correct but don know spock sits up and stretches
congratulations doctor and thank you
how do you feel spock
on the whole captain believe am quite fit fascinating remarkable example of retrograde civilisation at the peak advanced beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive level which you saw and it all began thousands of years ago when glacial age reoccurred this underground complex was developed for the women the men remained above and male-female schism took place fascinating cultural development of kind which never
knew it was wrong shouldn have done it
what that
should have never reconnected his mouth slanted eyebrow hits the ceiling
well we took the risk doctor
to kara amid laughter as was saying fascinating cultural development of the kind which hasn been seen in ages the last such occurrence took place on old earth when the romans were warring with the captain log stardate 5943 we have calculated that beta niobe will go nova in approximately three and half hours its only satellite sarpeidon is class planet which at last report was inhabited by civilised humanoid species now our instruments show that no intelligent life remains on the planet kirk mccoy and spock have beamed down
the power source we detected is in this building captain
any sign of survivors
no signs of sapient life forms
how can planet full of people just disappear
if they knew that their sun was dying it could be anything up to mass suicide
reports deny that they had any space flight capability this appears to be an archive or library of some kind
then we re certainly in the right place to find out what happened where the inhabitants are and if there are any left now
well that fine where do we start
may help you am the librarian may be of assistance silver-haired man called to perfect for librarian
perhaps you can mister
mister atoz confess that little surprised to see you had thought that everyone had long since gone but the surprise is pleasant one after all library serves no purpose unless someone is using it
you say everyone is gone where they go
it depended on the individual of course if you wish to trace specific person sorry but that information is confidential
no no particular person just people in general where did they go
ah you find it difficult to choose is that it yes wide range of alternatives is mixed blessing but perhaps can help would you step this way please they walk away from atoz and another one steps in front of them from between range of shelves
may help you you may select from more than twenty thousand verism tapes several hundred of which have only recently been added to the collection sure you ll find something here that pleases you you sir what is your particular field of interest
what about recent history
really oh that too bad we have so little on recent history there was no demand for it
it doesn have to be extensive just the answers to few questions
of course reference services available at the desk where another mr atoz is sitting
you re very late where have you been
you re very agile man mister atoz just how many of you are there we came as soon as we knew what was happening
forgive me sir it is my fault must have miscalculated our readings indicated that there was no one here at all
of course know everyone on this planet was warned of the coming nova long ago they followed instructions and are now safe and you had better do the same
did you say they were safe
absolutely every single one
where did they go
wherever they wanted to go of course it is strictly up to the individual choice
see and you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety
yes yes yes they are all gone except you three of course had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas
you are the real one mister atoz
of course am the real mister atoz
as matter of fact he quite real jim
let us take you with us to place of safety
no thank you plan to join my wife and family when the time comes now don be concerned about me think of yourselves warn you most urgently make your escape before it too late the library is at your complete service will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you history of the planet is available in every detail just choose what interests you the most the millennium the century the date the moment the library is your key puts disc in reader oh it in the wrong file make your own selection but remember you re very late
we ll choose it as quick as we can how long till nova
three hours thirteen minutes
this gentleman is not
you sir think you ll find something interesting over here he leads kirk to his desk
now if these won do can bring you another file atoz goes off to machine while kirk puts disc on the player and sees town scene with horse-drawn carriages and sedan chair spock goes over to mister atoz leaving mccoy browsing images of snow-covered waste
have you made your selection sir
exactly what is it that expected to select
sure was clear the period in which you re interested
see this is fascinating machine what is it
ah this is the atavachron
interesting nomenclature how does it work may
oh no sir no must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism return and make your selection when you have chosen will prepare you through the atavachron
thank you mister atoz kirk hears woman scream from behind doorway
spock bones
wait haven prepared you kirk runs through the doorway and disappears he appears in street where people dressed as cavaliers are manhandling wench
you must be prepared spock and mccoy go through the doorway
what is this place
yes and where is the captain
you dirty thing let go of me she gets spanked with sword
vile vixen kirk grabs his weapon
come when you are bidden slave kirk pushes him down you need lesson in how to use your betters who your master
free man sir
then you want better manners free man defend yourself so kirk gets into proper sword-fight with foils and wins the two cavaliers run off and the people laugh
heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat
what wrong
something preventing my phaser from operating
oh thank you man thought be limbered sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse
what that are you all right
oh took you to be an angler but you re none of us are ya well you re bully fine coe for all of that what handsome dish ya served them the coxcombs
you better come back with me to the library you ll be safe there doctor mccoy can see to those bruises
game love lead and ll follow where library
it right over there but all he sees is blank brick wall
where the captain spock we were right behind him
what with you man let make off before coxcombs come with shoulder clappers
no do you remember when you first saw me do you remember whether came through some kind of door
oh think the rum gull must ve kicked you in the head come on love know leech who ll ask no questions
no no it must be here someplace
jim can you hear us
bones spock
captain we hear you but we cannot see you
we must ve missed each other somehow
apparently they ve all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past
mercy on us it spirits
no no no no no these are friends of mine and they re
indeed not we re in wilderness of arctic characteristics
he means it cold
can you get to the library
there is no library captain at least not that we can see we are at the base of an ice cliff
explain
just before you disappeared captain discovered machine which mister atoz called the atavachron
it must have been tied in to the tape viewer somehow
opening time portals to the past you cross through into the period which you were viewing
was looking over some material about their ice age
am here evidently because stepped through at the same instant as doctor mccoy
yes mob approaches my friends are coming back with reinforcements
there the mort accomplice arrest him
we are the law and do require that you yield to us
on what charge
thievery and purse cutting
that mistake no thief
lord help us what that
it spirits
away away spirit and let honest men approach
keep talking
they speak at his bidding stop his mouth and they ll quiet kirk keep talking now but he is overpowered and dragged away
jim what the matter jim sounded like he was in trouble
we may be in trouble ourselves we must find shelter they walk on until mccoy collapses
in this severe cold we cannot survive much longer
leave me here spock
we go together or not at all
don be fool my hands and face are frostbitten can feel my feet alone you have chance now do what say go try to find jim
we go together
you stubborn thickheaded vulcan figure wearing full length fur coat with hood approaches then turns to walk away spock helps mccoy to follow it quite homely with the stalagmites and skins laid down the lovely smooth floor and handy bed for spock to put mccoy down on
he suffering from the severity of your weather unfortunately he is the doctor not ll avoid giving him any medication at this time perhaps if he kept quiet and warm he may recover naturally it is agreeably warm here their benefactor has pushed back the hood to reveal that it is young woman
what are you called
called spock
even your name is strange forgive me ve never seen anyone who looks like you why are you here are you prisoners too
prisoners
this is one of the places zor kahn sends people when he wants them to disappear didn you come in through the time portal
yes we came through the time portal but not as prisoners we were sent here by mistake
the atavachron is far away but think you come from someplace farther than that
that is true am not from the world you know at all my home is planet millions of light years away
oh how wonderful ve always loved books about such possibilities but they are only stories this isn real must be imagining all this going mad
listen to me am firmly convinced that do exist am substantial you are not imagining this
oh ve been here for so long alone when saw you out there couldn believe it is he dying
here there the mort and there the mort henchman
open up rouse him the somberly clothed judge sits on stool opposite kirk
you re the thief who talks to spirits
stranger
where are you from
an island
what is this island
it called earth
know no island earth no matter continue
never saw that woman before tonight when she screamed as far as could tell she was being attacked
then you deny being her accomplice
yes deny it was reading in the library when heard her scream my lord the library do you remember where the library is my lord
perhaps your part in this is innocent believe you to be an honest man
he witch
take care woman am convinced of your guilt do not compound it with false accusation
he speaks to unseen spirits he witch you heard the voices
it truth my lord heard the spirit talk to him he answered and did call it bones
you re witch he cast spell he made me steal against my wish
surely you don believe
you heard these spirits
aye my lord ll witness to it
what he heard my lord were only my friends behind the wall in the library in the library
know nothing of this send for someone learned in witchcraft and let him examine him will have nothing to do with it
my lord at least arrange for me to meet mister atoz
know of no atoz
yes yes atoz
know nothing of this nothing of these matters will not hear him
let me speak to you
will not hear him judge and law man leave
at least let me talk to you
witch witch witch they ll burn ya
mccoy mccoy wake up
who are you
my name is zarabeth
zarabeth spock are we in the library
no we are still in the ice age but safe for the moment
jim what about jim
doctor you re in no condition to get up you lie down and rest shall attempt to find the captain
you find him spock don you worry about me you just find him spock and zarabeth leave him to sleep
spock who is this jim she removes the fur coat to reveal she is wearing little more than leather bikini with boots
he our commanding officer and our friend
saw only the two of you did not know there was another
he did not come with us he was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one if am to find him there is only one possible avenue zarabeth will you show me where the time portal is
but your friend he is ill
yes that is true if leave him there chance he may never regain the ship he would then be marooned in this time period but he is no longer in danger of death so my primary duty to him has been discharged if remain here no one of our party would be able to aid captain kirk
you make it sound like an equation
it should be an equation should be able to resolve this problem logically perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron if only knew more about how it worked zarabeth you said that you were brought here as prisoner may ask
why my crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely two of them were involved in conspiracy to kill zor kahn
remember that name from the history tapes in the library zor kahn the tyrant
it was not enough that he execute my kinsmen zor kahn determined to destroy our entire family he used the atavachron to send us places no one could ever find us
zarabeth must return to mister atoz and the atavachron we will carry doctor mccoy and you must come with us will send you and the doctor to the ship and shall search for captain kirk
can go through the portal again if do will die
you cannot go back
none of us can go back when we come through the portal we are changed by the atavachron that is its function our basic cell structure is adjusted to the time we enter you can go back if you go through the portal again you will die by the time you reach the other side
standing spock where are we
you are safe here mccoy
yes remember you
come doctor back to bed
why are you still here spock why aren you looking for jim
it is impossible to look for him doctor we cannot go back
what do you mean impossible we ve got to get back
zarabeth explained it to me when we came through the time portal it altered our physiological structure if we attempt to return to the library we shall die
are you trying to tell me that we re trapped here
yes doctor we are trapped just as jim is trapped wherever he is captain log stardate 5943 the people of this time believe in witches and witchcraft is what ve been accused of five witnesses heard mccoy voice speak to me and thought it was an evil spirit from what know of witchcraft trials don have much chance unless can get to the prosecutor
no supper for you love lets the wench out of her cell come on up you go
give me your cup kirk manages to grab his arm and pull him against the bars
cry out and ll break it don move he takes the keys and unlocks his own cell lets himself out knocks out the jailor and drags in inside shutting the door behind him the judge comes down the steps
jailor jailor
being falsely accused you know that
you will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal there the matter of your witchcraft will be decided
there are no such things as witches
jailor that is sacrilege if they hear you they will burn you for such beliefs
you re the only one that can hear me and that the truth there are no witches why do you deny it
do not let them hear you there are witches there are you yourself may be discovered to be witch by the inquisitor no what are you doing no kirk drags him inside the cell
help help
ll denounce you to the inquisitor you came here from the future just as did therefore you too are witch
beg you do not implicate me they would burn me
then help me
will do everything can to prove you innocent will disprove all the charges of witchcraft but you must never again speak to the comrades you left behind
help me return to the library ve lost my way must get back there
you cannot get back
tell you must had two friends with me who are lost in another time period must find them you ll come back with us
we can never go back we must live out our lives here in the past the atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain patterns to make life natural here to return to the future would mean instant death
prepared was not prepared your mister atoz did not prepare me in any way
then you must get back at once if you were not transformed you can only survive for few hours here in the past come hurry hurry
zarabeth you are beautiful cook have you ever been told that
not recently
oh well you ll find that spock is quite delinquent in those matters
hadn noticed it
oh well now that feeling better you ll notice distinct difference in our approach
really
it something to look forward to think you must be well enough doctor to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer
no not yet
at your rate of progress it will be soon can see
doctor mccoy is making excellent progress
and mister spock has been practicing medicine without license don let him doctor you the doctor around here
and known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the enterprise
wonder where she is
five thousand years in the future
thank you zarabeth leaves them
wonder where jim is
who knows we can only hope that he is well wherever he is
what do you mean we can only hope haven you done anything about it
what was there to do
locate the portal it can be too far
we ve been through all that doctor what the point of rehashing that subject we can get back wasn that clear to you
yes that was clear to me
then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can get back means
don believe it spock it just not like you to give up trying
then ll repeat it for you get this through your head we can get back that means we are trapped here in this planet past just as we are and we ll stay here for the rest of our lives now do you understand
yes understand never thought hear it but understand you want to stay here as matter of fact you re highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste
the prospect appeared quite attractive to you moment ago
you listen to me you pointed-eared vulcan
don like that don think ever did and now sure
what happening to you spock
nothing that shouldn have happened long ago
long ago of course long ago back in the street at the wall kirk came through
this is where it is can remember the exact spot kirk feels along the wall until his hand disappears into it
that it that is the portal cannot wait any longer the judge hurries away and kirk slips through the wall back into the library
spock mccoy kirk to enterprise come in
how much time before the sun blows up away
we can scotty spock and mccoy are missing by
no under no circumstances send anyone else here without my orders prepare to warp out and stand by kirk out mister atoz where are you
may help you it you you re lucky you found your way back here now let me process you through the atava
no mister atoz my friends and are from another planet we don belong in your history we don belong on your planet at all
just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong
no want to find the exact disc that they were viewing
please go back
sorry mister atoz mister atoz they tussle
must prepare to escape kirk pushes him into side room and shuts the door then turns to face another atoz
ll let you out in minute still up to your little game of replicas which are you this time real or not he knocks this one out
you are evidently suicidal maniac don understand what you re trying to do but if you continue both of us will die and for one do not wish death
if you help me we won die promise you that
don trust you
which one are you now the replica or the real one
am the real atoz you ve done away with my replicas regret what must now do
you don really want to hurt me do you you ve been trying to save my life realise that put that thing away but atoz fires the little tube at kirk and he falls to the floor
cannot pretend to be sorry that you are here though realise it is misfortune for you here against my will too just as you are
sorry know of no way to return you to your own time
it not that wish to return this is my time now ve had to face that but it has been lonely here do you know what it like to be alone really alone
yes know what it is like
believe you do have something to eat please
if it pleases you this is animal flesh
there not much else to eat around here afraid
naturally because of the climate what is the source of heat in the shelter
there an underground hot spring
excellent then it will be possible to build greenhouse of sorts meanwhile this will have to do as the only source of nourishment he takes bite
there aren many luxuries around here zor kahn only left me what was necessary to survive
but he evidently intended that you continue living
yes he gave me weapons shelter food everything needed to live except companionship he did not want it said that he had me killed but to send me here alone if that is not death what is very inventive mind that man
but insensitive to send such beautiful woman into exile the cold must ve affected me more than realised please pay no attention not myself behaving disgracefully have eaten animal flesh and have enjoyed it what is wrong with me tell you you re beautiful but you are beautiful is it so wrong to tell you so
have longed to hear you say it they kiss then he picks her up and smiles broadly
you are beautiful more beautiful than any dream of beauty ve ever known he lays her down and sets the scene for many fan-fictions kirk wakes up lying on sled which atoz is pushing towards the portal
just stay where you are sir ll see you get to safety kirk rolls off so atoz tries to push him through he fails and gets overpowered
now you re going to help me look for my friends
you re most determined man
kirk here
no time to explain are you ready to warp out
stand by to beam us up but when that star explodes don wait get out fast kirk out now we re going to start looking they were in frozen waste could hear the wind
all right all right all right it must be the sarpeidon ice age five thousand years ago let me look
we ll both look mister atoz
spock you ve been dishonest with me spock and that is also something new for you
ve given you the facts doctor
the facts as you know them or did you just accept zarabeth word because it what you wanted to believe
you were told the truth if zarabeth is the source what difference does it make
zarabeth is woman condemned to terrible life of loneliness she would do anything to anybody to change that wouldn you zarabeth
told you what know
did you you said we can get back the truth is you can get back
she would not jeopardise other lives
she would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness she would lie she would cheat she would even murder me the captain the entire crew of the enterprise to keep you here with her go ahead zarabeth tell spock the truth go ahead tell spock you would kill
what are you doing to her spock pins mccoy against the cave wall
are you trying to kill me spock is that what you really want think what are you feeling rage jealousy have you ever had those feelings before
this is impossible impossible am vulcan
the vulcan you knew won exist for another five thousand years think man what happening on your planet right now this very moment
my ancestors are barbarians warlike barbarians
who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions spock you re reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born
ve lost myself do not know who am can we go back
don know only know that can go back
know going to try spock because my life is back there and want that life so mccoy heads off through the arctic winds with just fur shawl for protection
do you think that the right one
don know
if we re to get the portal set for the proper time period you must be specific
didn see it
well try calling out
bones spock mccoy you ve got the wrong one
please there no time left let me go
try again zarabeth and spock join mccoy at the ice cliff
there no portal here doctor it hopeless
suppose you re right
you re too ill to remain out here any longer give it up atoz views another disc
bones spock
it jim here we are jim
ve found them can you still hear me
follow my voice hear me keep following my voice spock mccoy
this must be it
what are you waiting for hurry
come on spock
you start ahead doctor do not wish to part from you
cannot come if go back will die
what are you waiting for hurry
how much time do we have
scotty how much time is there
come on spock now spock pushes mccoy towards the cliff but he doesn go through
something wrong
what the matter why can he get through
don know unless it because they originally went through the portal together
spock mccoy you can get through unless you both come back at the same time scotty
no wait time is running out zarabeth turns and leaves them mccoy and spock return without their furs atoz switches discs and runs through the portal
he had his escape planned glad he made it kirk to enterprise
there no further need to observe me doctor as you can see ve returned to the present in every sense
but it did happen spock
yes it happened but that was five thousand years ago and she is dead now dead and buried long ago
scotty are you there
beam us aboard and go to maximum warp as soon as we re there kirk out small craft which looks like tholian dart with small nacelles is being pursued by the enterprise
it is definitely the stolen space cruiser captain the aurora read six aboard
hailing frequencies aurora this is the uss enterprise captain james kirk commanding acknowledge aurora this is the enterprise do you read me
they are receiving us captain
read no evidence of malfunction
repeat federation orders to detain you for
they re veering off sir
change course pursue and overtake
aye aye sir
stand by tractor beams
standing by sir
if it continues on course it will enter romulan space
engage
tractor beam engaged
bring them in
they ve not cut power sir they re struggling to escape
their engines are seriously overheating captain
aurora cut power you are overtaxing your ship
power approaching critical they cannot continue
emergency power to tractor beams bridge to transporter room scotty are you ready to transport
aye captain
power beyond critical explosion is imminent the little ship glows red
are we within transportation range
not yet sir
aurora personnel stand by to be transported aboard energise the little ship makes big bang
are they aboard scotty are they aboard
aye captain they are and nice lot too say hello to the space hippies captain log stardate 5832 the son of the catullan ambassador is one of six we have beamed aboard from the stolen cruiser aurora we have been ordered to handle him with extreme delicacy because the treaty negotiations now in progress between the federation and catualla are in crucial phase
scotty take them to the briefing room
irina the hippies are seated on the floor of the transporter room
what going on
why
don know they re sitting on the floor the lot of them you can hear for yourself shall send for security
no ll be right down mister spock
no go no go no go
which one of you is tongo rad purple haired lad with shaggy eyebrows stands up
you can thank your father influence for the fact you re not under arrest in addition to piracy you ve left yourself open to charges of violating flight regulations entering hostile space and endangering the lives of others as well as your own
bleeding
in addition you ve caused an interstellar incident which may have destroyed everything that been negotiated between your planet and the federation
you ve got hard lip herbert
if you have an explanation am prepared to hear it rad sits down again
mister spock take them to sickbay for medical check there may have been radiation from the explosion
captain with your permission
by all means spock steps forward and makes triangular sign with his hands
one
an older male with alien ears obviously the leader we are one
one is the beginning
red-headed youth are you one herbert
am not herbert
he is not herbert we reach
if you will state your purpose and your objectives perhaps we can arrive at mutual understanding
if you understand one you know our purpose
would prefer that you state it
we turn our backs on confusion and seek the beginning
what is your destination
the planet eden
that planet it is myth
and we protest against being harassed pursued attacked seized and transported here against our wishes
right brother
we do not recognise federation regulations nor the existence of hostilities we recognise no authority save that within ourselves
well whether you recognise authority or not am it on this ship am under orders to transport you back to starbase peaceably from there you ll be ferried to your various planets because of my orders you are not prisoners but my guests expect you to behave as such
oh herbert you are stiff
mister spock you seem to understand these people you will deal with them
we respectfully request that you take us to eden
and after they are finished in sickbay see to it that they re escorted back to their proper quarters and given whatever care they need
yes captain
we respectfully request that you take us to eden
have orders to the contrary this is not passenger ship
herbert herbert herbert
herbert herbert herbert herbert herbert herbert
lieutenant palmer notify starbase we have the six aboard who stole the space cruiser aurora regrettably the space cruiser itself was destroyed
aye sir
personal note to the catullan ambassador his son is safe
captain
yes what is it
sir believe know one of them at least think recognise her voice her name is irina galliulin we were in starfleet academy together
one of those was in the academy
yes sir she dropped out she
do you wish to see her permission to leave your post
thank you sir spock enters
are they in the sickbay
yes captain chekov leaves
mister spock do they really believe that eden exists
many myths are based on truth captain and they are not unintelligent their leader doctor sevrin is man
doctor sevrin is their leader
yes brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics communications and electronics on tiburon he was dismissed from his post when he started this movement tong rad inherits his father extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies
well but they ve rejected all that and all that this technology provides and they seek the primitive
there are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created it is almost biological rebellion profound revulsion against the planned communities the programming the sterilised artfully balanced atmospheres they hunger for an eden where spring comes
all do the cave is deep in our memory
yes that is true captain
but we don steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible
what makes you so sympathetic toward them
it is not sympathy so much as curiosity captain wish to understand they regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds condition with which am somewhat familiar
spock what does herbert mean
it is somewhat uncomplimentary captain herbert was minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought
well shall try to be less rigid in my thinking the teenagers are having an impromptu concert
playing guitar without sound box looking for the good land going astray don cry don cry oh can have honey and can have cream gonna live not die gonna live not die rad plays bongos stand in the middle of it all one day ll look at it shining all around me and say here here in the good land in the new land here
excuse me is irina galliulin with you
she getting her physical gonna crack my knuckles and jump for joy got clean bill of health from doctor mccoy you know irina
say tell me why do you wear all those clothes how do you breathe chapel and two med-techs enter
to sevrin you re next the techs carry sevrin into the next room chapel leaves and irina enters
irina
pavel andreievich had thought we might encounter each other
you knew was on the enterprise
had heard
irina why come
how could you do this to yourself you were scientist and now look at you
look at yourself pavel
why did you do it
why did you
am proud of what am believe in what do can you say that
yes oh we should not tear at each other so pavel we should meet again in joy today when first knew it was your ship that followed us thought of you and wondered what would find and remembered so much in spite of that uniform still see the same pavel used to know
are you happy in what you do
yes
then accept what you do
you even talk like them why did you go away
it was you who went
came back to look for you looked where did you go
stayed in the city with friends
you never felt as did never
did
you don have it in you to feel so much even when we were close you weren with me you were off thinking of something else why did you stay away
because you disapproved of me just as you do now oh pavel you have always been like this so correct and inside the struggle not to be give in to yourself you will be happier you ll see
go to your friends irina leaves and there is commotion in the corridor
free doctor sevrin free doctor sevrin we want to see him right now
we want to see him now chekov joins the security guards and chapel trying to keep the kids out of sickbay
herbert herbert herbert herbert
thought all the animals were kept in cages
what going on bones
trouble your friend here didn want checkup turns out there reason
refuse to accept your findings
you don have the choice
they re the product of prejudice not science
don know what this man was planning on doing on primitive planet but assuming one did exist can tell you what would have happened had he settled there
untrue
there wouldn have been enough primitives left to bury their dead
fantasy fantasy
wish it were there nasty little bug evolved in the last few years jim our aseptic sterilised civilisations produced it synthococcus novae it deadly we can immunise against it but haven learned to lick all the problems yet
does he have it what about the others
all the others are clear he doesn have it he carrier remember your ancient history typhoid mary he immune as she was but he carries the disease and spreads it to others
is the crew in danger
don know they all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too but regular programme of shots is necessary ll have to check everyone on the ship there could be some skips in the meantime he should be placed in total isolation
this is outrageous you re not isolating me you re imprisoning me you invent crime find me guilty and sentence me
would you like to run the test doctor you knew you were carrier before you came aboard didn you
no
then why did you fight the examination
it was an infringement on my rights
put him in isolation the two med-techs haul sevrin away
be ready for the objections jim they are vocal lot
yes ready kirk to security want guard maintained on doctor sevrin until further notice bones how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection
it ll show in twenty four hours it virulent strain sulu is being chatted up by brunette
you don belong with them you know what we want you want it too come join us
how do you know what want
you re young think young brother
you make it tempting
mister sulu mister sulu explain
no explanation sir
doctor sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe
singing stiff man putting my mind in jail and the judge bang the gavel and say no bail gonna lick his hand and wag my tail
herbert herbert
yes scotty what is it you call ems the boot out of here she came in bold as brass tried to incite my crew to disaffect
thank you scotty mister spock don seem to be able to communicate with these people do you think you can persuade them to behave
shall make an attempt captain
thank you mister spock if it weren for that ambassador son they all be in the brig
yes sir captain log stardate 5832 the arrogance of doctor sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the enterprise if it continues ll be forced to use controls which might not agree with starfleet suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance
have no influence over what they do
they respect you they will listen to your reasoning for their sake you must stop them doctor sevrin in position to help you and your group can use the resources of the enterprise to determine whether or not eden actually exists and to plot its exact location can present case to federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet neither you nor your people are at present charged with crime however incitement to disaffection is criminal the federation will never allow the colonisation of planet by criminals if they persist they will be so charged and forever barred from eden
as have been barred
then you knew you were carrier
of course knew you ve researched my life you ve read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology because of what my body carries
what fail to understand is why you disobey those orders
because this is poison to me this stuff you breathe this stuff you live in the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet the programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you they bred what my body carries that what your science have done to me you ve infected me only the primitives can cleanse me cannot purge myself until am among them only their way of living is right must go to them
your very presence will destroy the people you seek surely you know that
shall go to them and be one with them and together we shall build world such as this galaxy has never seen world life life so now you re going to try to persuade me that your technologies will find cure for me and then ll be free to go
yes doctor
and for that reason should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed
yes doctor
all right you send them in ll talk to them
doctor sevrin is insane ve not consulted doctor mccoy but have no doubt of it
ll have bones check him out spock sorry you had great respect for him but it does explain some of what they ve done
his condition does not affect my interest in the movement there is no insanity in what they seek made promise which should like to keep with your permission must locate eden shall work in my quarters may have the assistance of mister chekov in auxiliary control
certainly mister chekov assist mister spock bridge to sickbay
bones
like to talk to you captain log stardate 5832 have asked doctor mccoy to check starfleet medical records to verify mister spock suspicion that doctor sevrin is insane in spite of doctor sevrin antipathy to us he has promised mister spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations
come in
am crossing you
no
was just thinking sees the lyre hey brother do you play is it vulcan can try it spock gestures his permission and the young man strums chord
oh ho that now that real now reach that brother really do give he hands the lyre to spock who plays it briefly
hey how about session you and us it would sound that what came for wanted to ask you know great white captain upstairs but he don reach us but would he shake on session mean we want to co-operate like you ask so asking
if understand you correctly believe the answer might be yes
ll spread the word
am allowed in
yes
have been looking for you pavel what room is this
auxiliary control
what it for
should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage we can navigate the ship from here what do you want
to apologise should not have teased you it was cruel
it does not matter
oh but it does it is against everything believe in
let us not discuss your beliefs
and do not like having you angry with me or disapproving
then why do you do such things
what are you working on
am assisting mister spock in locating your eden
oh now you are teasing me
am not these tapes contain star charts and we project the orbits of the various planets here by mathematical process we determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted
do you know all these things
what do not know find out from the computer banks if if knew nothing at all could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there they contain the sum of all human knowledge they solve our problems of navigation of control of life support
they tell you what to do and you do what they tell you
no we use our own judgment also
could never obey computer
you could never listen to anyone you always had to be different
not different what wanted to be there is nothing wrong in doing what you want chekov gives in and kisses her am not receiving
am sorry mister spock was momentarily delayed
his name is sulu specialist in weapons and navigation his hobby is botany
can
can reach botany it my favorite of studies what yours
vulcan spock is practically one now
everything can be handled from auxiliary control the computers contain all the information we need we can do it
it starts to chime
when will it
soon like he said now we should all go out and swing as many as possible over
can you suggest any special ways to swing them
just be friendly you know how to be friendly then they ll be friendly sounds are being laid down in session and piped through the ship
singing talkin bout you talkin bout me long time back when the galaxy was new man found out what he had to do found he had to eat and he found he had to drink and long time later he found he had to think uh huh yes think standing here wondering
what
if man tells another man out of my way he piles up trouble for himself all day but all kinds of trouble come to an end when man tells another man be my friend uh huh my friend well what it going to be
singing there mile wide emptiness between you and me spock arrives with his lyre
can reach across it hardly even see
someone ought to take step one way or other
with chorus let say goodbye or let say brother brother brother hey out there hey out there hey out there hey out there see you see you see you see you let get together and have some fun don know how to do it but it got to be done then spock plays accompanied by girl playing what looks like wire-spoked wheel in the brig rad climbs up ladder and uses pressure points to knock out the guard then he releases sevrin from his cell many of the crew are moving to the beat
at least we know where they are and what they re doing don know why young mind has to be an undisciplined one they re troublemakers
used to get into little trouble when was that age scotty didn you rad takes out the man on duty in auxiliary control then he and sevrin sit down and start changing things
captain get no response from controls we re going off course
it shorted no it channeled over somewhere to auxiliary control
bridge to auxiliary control bridge to auxiliary control
captain it seems as though someone else is running the ship all his followers are there now
am all functions life support as well you cannot interfere as have frozen the doors to the control room to you until and unless we reach eden
if am in any way prevented from reaching that destination shall destroy this ship and all aboard
can he do it
he has the capability captain
start trace-back of all circuits
do that and shall retaliate
captain we re now leaving the neutral zone bearing into romulan space
any patrols
negative
there will be soon doctor sevrin you are violating romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy military intrusion and attack bring the ship about now if you bring her about
and return to starbase no charges will be leveled
like you said brother sevrin
if you do not you will never reach eden you and this ship will be destroyed
adam
you are being led by man who is insane
spock you tell them
adam there is file on doctor sevrin in our computer banks in it you ll find report attesting to the fact
that he is carrier of bacillus strain known as synthococcus novae
sarcastic ain that just awful
you ll also find report from the same hospital giving full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his
yay brother
adam you know reach you believe in what you seek but there is tragic difference between what you want and what he wants
you re making me cry
there it is they ve established eden brother sevrin
pavel said they would our original course must have been somewhat in error
when will we get there
at this speed three hours
they ll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they ll attack
how do you plan to stop them by cutting off their life support
have another weapon take control brother rad sevrin takes the cover off wall access point
what are you doing
making an adjustment on their circuits
singing headin out to eden yea brother headin out to eden no more trouble in my body or my mind gonna live like king on whatever find eat all the fruit and throw away the rind yea brother yea
we are within sensor range of eden and continuing to approach
whatever they re going to do they re going to do now we have no choice mister spock mister scott
when will you use that
at the proper time let me know when we re in orbit
approaching right on the dot just as they plotted it brother sevrin
what will that do to them what is it
well using sound against them beyond the ultrasonic it will stun them and allow us time to leave we ll go in one of their shuttlecraft
sound pitched that high doesn stun it destroys remember when we read in the text that it
ve gone beyond those texts irina it correct for you to be concerned but be assured also
we are in orbit over eden brother sevrin it does destroy
we cannot allow them to come after us it will not reach us in here can control it all have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after few moments and allow us time to escape then after we ve gone it will automatically reactivate rejoice brethren soon we shall step together into eden flame appears in the wall behind them scott is trying to cut into the room with phaser sevrin turns on his sonic weapon and spock is instantly stricken with pain
spock it all right spock it stopped
no captain it hasn stopped it has gone beyond now it affects kirk scott is already unconscious
captain they re using all over the ship people fall to the floor
steppin into eden yea brother steppin into eden yea brother no more trouble in my body or my mind gonna live like king on whatever find eat all the fruit and throw away the rind yea brother
now we may leave scott kirk and spock are waking up
in pain captain go you must destroy the
what is it
ultrasonics the panel kirk staggers into the room and turns off the sound
kirk to engineering bridge hangar deck kirk to transporter room kirk to bridge do you read me come in and then
never mind do we have control of the ship
can we break out of orbit if we have to
think so sir
kirk here
sir one of the shuttlecrafts has been taken we were all knocked out
stand by do you read any romulans
negative captain however am picking up the shuttlecraft
where
it has landed except for those aboard the craft read no life at all either humanoid nor animal
auxiliary control to doctor mccoy bones are you all right
stand by transporter room full medical gear sir
no no they tried to destroy us let them think they succeeded want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down we won be visible to them scotty you have the conn if any romulans appear try to make them understand do not want to provoke combat mister spock mister chekov join us in the transporter room looking remarkable like miramanee planet right down to the lake or maybe the pleasure planet
the legends were true captain fantastically beautiful planet
eden
is this what they believed they find then can understand spread out approach with caution into communicator doctor sevrin chekov screams
what is it
the flower sir touched it it like fire his palm is covered in blisters
it burned all this plant life is full of acid even the grass jim
will our clothing protect us
it should for while
captain our young minstrel is spread out on the ground half-eaten fruit beside him
bones
poison the fruit is deadly
his name was adam
there the shuttlecraft the door opens the hippies have blisters on their feet and can walk kirk picks up irina and carries her
here we ll help you the youngsters come out and finally sevrin
doctor sevrin bones
he should be beamed aboard jim he needs more than can do for him here
spock to enterprise
stand by to beam aboard injured parties medical team to the transporter room
no we re not leaving
we can help you aboard the ship
we re not leaving eden none of us
be sensible doctor
we re not leaving sevrin runs off on his blistered feet and climbs fruit tree
come back here you fool
sevrin don you ll kill yourself
don bite into that
stop but man takes bite of the forbidden fruit and loses eden forever
it was so beautiful
have starbase now captain
alert them that we have the four and we re ready to beam them down and mark the incident closed
aye sir
bridge to transporter scotty are they there
stand by mister chekov do you wish to attend
captain wish first to apologise for my conduct during this time did not maintain myself under proper discipline endangered the ship and its personnel by my conduct respectfully submit myself for disciplinary action
thank you mister chekov you did what you had to do as did we all even your friends you may go
thank you sir irina enters
was coming to say goodbye
and was coming to say goodbye to you kiss be incorrect occasionally
and you be correct
occasionally
miss galliulin it is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for eden have no doubt but that you will find it or make it yourselves
thank you irina leaves
we reach mister spock captain log stardate 5121 orbiting the second planet in the minarian star system this star has long given evidence of entering nova phase and six months ago research station was established to make close-up studies of the star as its end approaches minara is now entering critical period and the enterprise has been ordered to evacuate the station before the planet becomes uninhabitable yet our attempts to contact the station personnel have been so far unsuccessful
dust apparently these instruments have not been recently used
record tape maybe it ll tell us something about the personnel that lived here
kirk here what is it enterprise
our instruments have picked up gigantic solar flare accompanying it
how bad
our sensors indicate the cosmic ray concentration measures three point five one on the ritter scale that ll play the very devil with the crew as well as the ship
at that rate it will take exactly seventy four point one solar hours for the storm to pass
get that ship out of here stay at minimum distance for absolute safety
aye aye sir we ll beam you up in us
get that ship out of here mister scott
mister spock what about that tape
remember captain what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago godforsaken place ninety five verse four looks like he was listening piercing noise makes them cover their ears then ozaba vanishes he vanishes too
what happened to them the same noise comes again
where does that sound coming from spock can you pinpoint it
negative captain it doesn register spock disappears then mccoy
bones spock he tries to leave but falls back into the floor then he vanishes too leaving just body print in the dust the three awaken lying on the floor of big bare room blue floor red walls
spock bones where are we
exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface captain
how did we get here
residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by matter-energy scrambler similar to our own transporter mechanism
that nasty cut jim does it hurt
no
captain picking up life-form reading bearing four two mark seven
one of the missing scientists
negative although humanoid it is definitely not homo sapiens
identification
impossible can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid
let find out phasers on stun they start walking
approaching the life-form captain
what is it
still undistinguishable light reveals young woman lying on what might be bed which is itself on stepped platform mccoy moves towards her
be careful
she seems harmless enough
the sand-bats of manark four appear to be inanimate rock crystals doctor until they attack she wakes using big gestures and mimes her fear of kirk phaser
we re not going to hurt you is this your home do you live here what about it spock analysis
from what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet life-form such as hers could not evolve here they put their phasers away
are you responsible for bringing us here don be afraid bones what wrong with her
she mute jim no vocal cords not even vestigals and don think it pathological condition
explain
she appears to be perfectly healthy as for the other her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species whatever that is
race of mutes like the civilisation on gamma vertis four
that my observation for whatever it worth
without speech how she going to be able to understand us unless she telepath
an unlikely possibility captain since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them she made no attempt to contact our minds
we can keep referring to her as she as if she weren here
do you have any ideas
well don know about you but going to call her gem
gem doctor
well that better than hey you
want to know why we re here want to know what going on and she knows two big-headed aliens in silver robes appear first cousins to the talos people by the looks of them
captain
we are aware of your identity captain
who are you why did you bring us here
we are vians do not interfere
what do you intend to do with us
delay us no longer
we come moves forward and gets pushed back by weapon since you already know who we are you must also know that we come in peace our prime directive specifically prohibits us from any interference the vians fire their weapons several times and the landing party is caught in some sort of enery field the vians go to gem
can seem to stand up
don fight the force field there something about it that upsets the body metabolism
not quite doctor the field draws its energy from your bodies the more you resist the stronger the force field becomes sufficient the vians vanish then the forcefield
mister spock there must be an exit other than the one we just saw
correct captain spock goes off scanning with his tricorder
do you feel all right jim
don worry about me they may have hurt her kirk takes her hands she takes deep breath and turns away
did they hurt you then gem turns back and touches the cut on kirk head it disappears from him and appears on her forehead instead then vanishes
the pain is gone she touched my head and the pain is gone
the wound is completely healed it fits jim she must be an empath her nervous system is so sensitive highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions they become part of her spock returns
thank you
captain in that direction my tricorder is now picking up substantial collection of objects
details
electronically sophisticated devices fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there
well they re there now let go check them out to gem staying here alone could be dangerous come with us the group comes to collection of computer-like items girder structures holding up nothing glass tubes herein called the laboratory
fascinating
look at this stuff
bones spock come here he has found the scientists preserved in perspex tubes in the same positions that they vanished from the research lab
jim spock there are three empty tubes with the away teams names on them
we are on schedule some further simple tests are necessary
we ve seen the results of some of your tests
found our missing men dead another one of your experiments
you re wrong their own imperfections killed them they were not fit subjects come time is short
yes your time is running out this sun is about to nova when it does it ll destroy you this planet and this insane torture chamber spock neck-pinches the alien
let get out of here
readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction as they head off lal wakes up and watches them go he is joined by the other alien strong wind is blowing as they emerge from cave
kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise come in out of range readings mister spock
research station six kilometres in that direction captain
let get there as fast as we can if the enterprise has search party it ll be there the group run on gem isn very good at running and mccoy falls over stone once
spock much further
just ahead
hey jim look scotty and search party
scotty
scotty
stay there come on
we re coming when gem stumbles again kirk sees the aliens watching their progress he sends her on ahead of him
keep going
their will to survive is great
they love life greatly to struggle so
the prime ingredient scott and the rescue team vanish
where they go
believe they were never actually present doctor it was mirage gem gestures to them to go back with her
where kirk they find kirk on the ground
jim
what are you doing here where scotty
captain it was mirage
captain kirk we have decided that one specimen will be sufficient you will come with us
what about the others
we ve no interest in them they may go
very well
you can go back there you ll end up like the other two
captain request permission to be allowed
denied
but captain
you have your orders mccoy spock and gem vanish
what happened to my men
they are safe
one specimen you said one specimen what happened to my men
indeed the prime ingredient
where are they tell me you said you let them go
mister sulu will you give us an estimate of how much longer we ll have until those solar flares will subside
aye sir readings now indicate two point seven two one on the ritter scale at the present rate of decrease we ll have to wait at least seventeen hours more before we can even attempt to enter orbit
aye well as long as we re stuck out here we might as well relax until the storm passes
the storm already lasted four hours longer than we ve anticipated do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger
that not likely the planet atmosphere will give them ample protection and if know captain kirk he ll be more worried about us than we are about him kirk is currently stripped and dangling from couple of chains crucifixion-style he is suffering and gem is watching
what is it you want to know
we seek no information as you mean your civilisation is yet too immature to have knowledge valuable to us
you don need any knowledge from us yet you re willing to kill for it is that what happened to linke and ozaba
we did not kill them their own fears killed them
well what did you expect from them and what do you want from me
we ve already observed the intensity of your passions and gauged your capacity to love others now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will
why what is it you hope to prove if my death is to have any meaning at least tell me what dying for
if you live you will have your answer
come on spock the passageway was there before it got to be there
doctor unable to lock in on the previous readings can find no exit out of here flash gem and clothed but unconscious kirk appear along with the forcefield to restrain mccoy and spock
captain kirk wakes jim what is it what have they done to you gem starts to try to heal kirk but recoils at the pain
help him don be afraid to help him she does taking the pain from his shoulders and the wounds from his wrists gem collapses the forcefield is gone
jim you lie still ll check her out right away
will she live
she seems fine now
can you explain what happened
complete empathy she must be totally functional empath her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength she virtually sustained your body physiological reactions
she weakened could feel it is her life in danger
it impossible to say yet but supplying your body with life support did drain her
her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death doctor only your urging her on caused her to continue
that true fear would naturally be her first reaction perhaps she doesn know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him
could the strain really have killed her
oh yes however assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it how do you feel
tired
can you recall what happened captain
remember the laboratory and they wanted to know something but can remember
take it easy
what the matter with me
you have all the symptoms of the bends nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain now how would one get the bends down here
you ll have to ask the vians will live
well you could use some time in decompression chamber but otherwise say your recovery is about miraculous wish could take the credit for it but she did the work
captain noted that light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the vian laboratory
spock why do you have to get so analytical at time like
no he right continue
conclude such light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source spock refers to the hand device they took off lal
can you tap into it
if can determine the frequency at which this device operates might be able to cause it to function for us
and get us out of here the same way we were brought in
would say so
then would say proceed
you are called captain you are responsible for the lives of your crew is this correct
it is
we find it necessary to have the co-operation of one of your men in our efforts
we will not co-operate
when we resume our interrogations you will decide which of your men we shall use it is essential there is an eighty seven percent chance that the doctor will die and while commander spock life is not in danger the possibility is ninety three percent that he will suffer brain damage resulting in permanent insanity later
how it coming spock
do not know captain beginning to understand its operating principles but that is all
spock it won be long before the vians come back you better find out how that thing works and soon
take it easy bones
men weren intended to live this far underground it just not natural
and space travel is
some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface
doctor not coal miner
ve recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder doctor should the vians return there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments
not mechanic couldn get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left
possibly not but you and the captain together will be able to do so
in any case spock you re the logical one to leave with the captain
the decision mine if there are any decisions to be made ll make them if and when it becomes necessary kirk appears to be in discomfort mccoy prepares hypo and injects him
don need any
still chief medical officer of the enterprise ll tell you what you need and when you need it would you rather have the bends that it just lie down and relax
how long will he be asleep doctor
between the emotional strain and that attack of bends he in pretty bad shape
not criticizing your action doctor on the contrary quite grateful for it the captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult decision you have simplified the situation considerably
how
while the captain is asleep am in command when the vians return shall go with them
you mean if hadn given him that shot
precisely the choice would have been the captain now it is mine mccoy turns away spock sits to carry on working gem puts her hand on spock shoulder and smiles mccoy comes up behind him and gives him an injection
your action is highly unethical my decision stands spock falls asleep next to kirk
not this time spock the vians return
the choice has been made to gem you stay here with my friends they ll take care of you do you understand
come then mccoy puts down his bag and tricorder then the three vanish now it is mccoy who is being crucified from the chains
doctor please understand that if there was any other way to accomplish our purpose
get on with it so they do
why did you let him do it
was convinced in the same way you were captain by the good doctor hypo
anything
hmm most unusual device it is control unit but not control mechanism in fact it is not mechanical device
what exactly is it
this control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it it is activated solely by mental commands
can you adapt it re-attune it to fit our brain pattern
shall attempt to do so however it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at time am of course most familiar with my own pattern therefore with your permission
do whatever you have to to make it work spock what disturbs me is why the vians let us keep it
fascinating they must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it
and that we would use it to escape
the only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go
and they keep mccoy
that is evidently their intention captain
to gem somehow you re the crux the focal point of all this even before we got here she was prisoner they didn hurt her they didn even threaten her
indeed the facts would indicate that she essential to their purpose
yes there is purpose but what is it has all the pain and terror happened or been made to happen for you
completed captain the adjustments are delicate they may not survive more than even one use however there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the enterprise
will it take us to mccoy
if you so desire
the best defence is strong offense and intend to start offending right now aim for the lab spock kirk and gem arrive at to find mccoy alone still suspended from the chains gem is horrified
bones spock get him down his wrists they lie him on couch his pulse is almost gone how is he
severe heart damage signs of congestion in both lungs evidence of massive circulatory collapse

don talk don speak take it easy until we get you back to the ship what is it what the matter
he dying jim we can make him comfortable but that is all
you don know you re not doctor
internal injuries bleeding in the chest and abdomen haemorrhage of the spleen and liver seventy percent kidney failure
he right jim being doctor has its drawbacks always wondered why coughs so they turn him on his side thanks
how long
it could happen anytime
the correct medical phrase ay spock you ve got good bedside manner spock
can we do something
afraid not
gem might be able to help him the way she helped me but could his nearness to death also kill her
uncertain captain dr mccoy analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it however we cannot be positive
if she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death we might be able to save him forcefield stops them from getting to where gem is crouching in fear
no interference will be permitted
she can save his life let us help her to go to him
she must not be urged or forced to take action
all must proceed without interference
the purpose that brought us together
what purpose can all this serve except the fulfilment of some need of yours
we have but one need left in life and that is to see the completion of the final moment of our test
be patient
patient our friend is dying
perhaps
what purpose can be served by the death of our friend except to bring you pleasure surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct your sun will nova
we know
then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed
that is why we are here
this arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure will it prevent this catastrophe
no it will not but it may save gem planet of all the planets of minara we have the power to transport the inhabitants of only one to safety
if gem planet is the one that will be saved we must make certain beyond any doubt whatsoever they are worthy of survival
how will the death of our friend serve this purpose
his death will not serve it but her willingness to give her life for him will you were her teachers
we were what could she learn from us
your will to survive your love of life your passion to know they are recorded in her being
her planet will be fortunate
each of you is willing to give his life for the others we must now find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to gem small earthquake shakes the room
time grows short
you were correct captain everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them this has all been great laboratory and we have been the subjects of the test
no we only created the circumstances that was necessary
your actions were spontaneous everything that is truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed by you those are the qualities that make civilisation worthy to survive gem goes and sits by mccoy
behold that is most significant an instinct new to the essence of her being is generating
compassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life system gem moves her hands over mccoy not quite touching him his bruises and cuts heal transferring to her before disappearing she slumps crying silently then she tries for the internal injuries but falls away in agony
she is afraid
she saving herself she does not yet have the instinct to save her people
we have failed
no no not yet
captain dr mccoy life is not solely dependent on gem the vians too must be capable of saving his life
true
then you cannot let him die
his death is not important we must wait to see whether her instinct for self-sacrifice has become stronger than her instinct for self-preservation mccoy starts to wake gem returns to him
don touch me stay away jim spock are you here
yes bones
don let her touch me she ll die jim can destroy life even if it to save my own can you know that can let you do it mccoy pushes gem away
captain
what is it
the intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field
yes know
it draws its energy from us captain in spite of what we see all emotion must be suppressed that might weaken the field
ll try spock leaves the forcefield but kirk remains trapped
yes
spock
you cannot use our powers to change what is happening
you must save the life of our friend
no we will not her instinct must be developed to the fullest the test must be complete
it is complete gem has earned the right of survival for her planet she offered her life
to offer is not proof enough
if death is all you understand here are four lives for you kirk returns the two devices
we will not leave our friend you ve lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought gem here to experience you don understand what it is to live love and compassion are dead in you you re nothing but intellect lal goes over to mccoy and heals him then picks up the unconscious gem
farewell they recede into the darkness
strange
what is puzzling you captain
not puzzled mister spock am awed
with you captain she awed me
no no wasn thinking of gem was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with gem
captain the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by civilisation as advanced as the vians
not to dispute your computer mister spock but from little what you ve told me would say she was pearl of great price
what scott
do you not know the story of the merchant the merchant who when he found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it
yes she was all that and whether the vians bought her or found her makes little difference she was of great value
well personally find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most
perhaps the vulcans should hear about this
mister spock can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news
possibly captain shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due
mister sulu ahead warp factor two
aye aye sir warp factor two the enterprise is at red alert as six missiles head towards it spock is in the captain chair
do we have maximum magnification lieutenant
yes sir kirk enters
missile spread mister spock
very archaic type captain sub light speed
aye and chemically fuelled to boot sir
anything on communications lieutenant uhura
no sir all bands clear
course of the missile mister spock
it would appear that the enterprise is the target captain
prepare phaser banks one and two mister sulu
aye sir
mister chekov get fix on the missile point of origin
aye captain
phasers one and two locked in and ready
fire phasers the missiles are obliterated mister chekov alter course to the missile point of origin
aye sir
warp factor three mister sulu
warp factor three sir
am nurse first doctor mccoy and member of the crew of the enterprise second
you re excused you may return to your quarters
no sorry doctor ve called the captain and ll wait until he comes kirk enters
what the emergency
said you were excused nurse please christine promise you ll give the captain full report chapel leaves
that was quite scene
ve just completed the standard physical examinations for the entire crew
excellent what the emergency
the crew is fit found nothing unusual with one exception
serious
terminal
what is it
xenopolycythemia it has no cure
who
he has one year to live
who is it
the ship chief medical officer
you
ll be most effective on the job in the time left if you ll keep this to yourself captain log stardate 5476 have just had the sad duty of informing starfleet about doctor mccoy condition and have requested an immediate replacement the enterprise has arrived at an asteroid
mister spock
yes captain
confirm chekov co-ordinates for the missile point of origin
correct captain we are approaching those co-ordinates
that object on the screen
an asteroid two hundred miles in diameter
could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid
negative captain we ve had that area on scanners constantly
then the asteroid is the missile point of origin
correct captain
full sensor probe mister spock
typical asteroid chemically but it is not orbiting it is pursing an independent course through this solar system
how could that be unless it powered spaceship
it is under power captain and correcting for all gravitational stresses
source of power
atomic very archaic leaving trail of debris and hard radiation
mister chekov plot the course of the asteroid vessel
aye sir
asteroid has an outer shell which is hollow it surrounds an independent inner core which has breathable atmosphere sensors read no life forms
then it must be on automatic controls
then the passengers or builders are dead
course of asteroid mean spaceship two four one mark one seven
interesting
yes
the course ensign chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it on collision course with daran five
daran five inhabited
correct population approximately three billion and seven hundred twenty four million if memory serves me correctly estimated time of impact three hundred ninety six days
mister sulu match enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel mister spock and are transporting aboard mister scott you have the conn
aye sir
lot can happen in year please give yourself every minute
doctor mccoy mister spock and will handle this
without me jim you never find your way back
well think it would be wiser if
like to go fine captain
all right doctor if that what you want dead flat soil rocky outcrops orange sky
you swear you were on the surface of planet
one fails to see the logic in making ship look like planet
wouldn know this was spaceship kirk to enterprise
transported without incident kirk out they go exploring and see large tubular structures sticking out of the ground
no apparent opening
you found no intelligent life forms mister spock but surely
the asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old doctor still no sign of life forms captain two tubes lift up to reveal openings and aggressive men in plaid suits leap out and attack them woman watches mccoy sees her and gets knocked out kirk and spock are overpowered the phasers and communicators are handed to her
these are weapons
of sort weapons communication devices let me go to my friend she allows kirk to go to mccoy
you all right
think so
am natira the high priestess of the people welcome to the world of yonada
can say think much of your welcome
take them everyone gets inside the tube and goes down the stairs natira leads the way along corridor the people bow to her natira opens the door by waving her hands in front of carved symbols
you will kneel kirk spock and mccoy kneel natira steps onto pentagonal platform and kneels in front of an obelisk with sun-burst on it
she called this the world these people don know they re on spaceship
they ve been in flight ten thousand years maybe they don realise it
oh oracle of the people most perfect and wise strangers have come to our world they bear instruments we do not understand she stands and turns to face the three
who are you they stand too
am captain kirk of the starship enterprise this is my medical officer doctor mccoy my first officer mister spock
for what reason do you visit this world
we ve come in friendship there sound of lightning
then learn what it means to be our enemy before you learn what it means to be our friend the away team are lit up as if by electricity they collapse unconscious they wake up in nicely furnished room mccoy and spock are lying down kirk slumped over table
spock he wakes doctor mccoy bones bones but mccoy doesn wake
the doctor must have received an excessively large electrical shock
no that not it
nothing else could ve caused this captain at least nothing that has happened here
you re right spock the shock was serious because of mccoy weakened condition
may ask precisely what is troubling the doctor
don think he would ve told you himself but think you should know now it xenopolycythemia
yes know of it captain
then you know that nothing can be done mccoy finally wakes up
bones how is it
all right are you all right mister spock
very well doctor the captain and seem to have suffered no ill effects
oh that oracle really got to me must be especially susceptible to its magic spells
spock knows
well we better get to the control room
are you in any condition to get up
don worry can make it jim
captain informing these people they re on ship may be in violation of the prime directive of starfleet command
no the people of yonada may be changed by the knowledge but it better than exterminating them
logical captain
and the three billion on daran five
also logical captain
gentlemen believe we have visitor silver-haired old man in purple and orange looks around nervously before bowing then taking bottle from his cummerbund he hands out tablets
for strength many of us have felt the power of our oracle this has been of benefit
it tastes like an ancient herb derivative
you are not of yonada
no we re from outside your world
where is outside
up there outside up there everywhere
so they say also he winces in pain many years ago climbed the mountains even though it is forbidden another wince
why is it forbidden
am not sure wince but things are not as they teach us for the world is hollow and have touched the sky now he clutches his head as he collapses in agony
what is it bones
there something under the skin red light goes out he dead
for the world is hollow and have touched the sky
he said it was forbidden to climb the mountains
yes of course it is because if you did you touch the sky and find out that you were living on big ball not planet but spaceship and that knowledge seems to be forbidden natira arrives with two women bearing food and drink
what happened
we don know he just suddenly screamed in pain and died
to woman fetch the guard kneels and prays forgive him for he was an old man and old men are sometimes foolish but it is written that those of the people who sin or speak evil shall be punished guards arrive he served well for many years take him away gently the body is removed and mccoy sits down
you do not seem well it is distressing to me
oh no quite all right thank you
it is the will of the oracle that you now be treated as honoured guests she goes to help the women prepare the food and pour drink
you seem to be the special favourite
indeed doctor the young lady did show marked preference for your company
well now nobody can blame her for that can they
personally find the lady taste questionable but she obviously prefers you and you obviously don seem to mind if you could arrange to be alone with the young lady spock and would be left alone to find the power controls of this world
it is time to refresh yourselves glasses are handed out
thank you mister spock to our good friends of yonada
we are very interested in your world
that pleases us
good then you wouldn mind if we looked around
not at all the people know of you now to mccoy are you well enough to go about
perhaps not
then why not remain here rest we will talk
you are very kind
you are free to go about and meet our people
thank you and thank you for taking care of doctor mccoy
not at all we shall make him well
mister spock kirk and spock leave one woman offers plate of food
no thank you
leave us the women leave
curious how did the oracle punish the old man
cannot tell you now
there is some way the oracle knows what you say isn there
what we say what we think the oracle knows the minds and the hearts of all the people did not know you would be hurt so badly
it all right suppose we had to learn the power of the oracle
mccoy there is something must say since the moment it is not in the manner of the people to hide their feelings
honesty is usually wise
is there woman for you
no there isn
does mccoy find me attractive
oh yes yes do
hope you men of space of other worlds hold truth as dear as we do
we do
wish you to stay here on yonada as my mate
but we re strangers to each other
but is not that the nature of men and women that the pleasure is in the learning of each other
yes
let the thought rest in your heart mccoy
incredible as it may seem these people have no idea they re living on spaceship
wonder how many generations have lived out their lives and been buried here without ever knowing that their world is hollow
the people in the fullness of time will reach new world rich green lovely to the eyes and of goodness that will fill the hearts of the people with tears of joy you can share that world with me rule it by my side
how long will it take you to reach this new world
soon the oracle will only say soon
if you only knew how needed some kind of future natira
you have lived lonely life
yes very lonely
no more mccoy there will be no more loneliness for you
there something need to tell you
there is nothing you need to say
but there is
then tell me if the telling is such need
have an illness for which there is no cure have one year to live
until saw you there was nothing in my heart it sustained my life but nothing more now it sings could be happy to have that feeling for day week month year whatever the creators hold in store for us they kiss
captain the oracle room
the problem to get in
believe that can kirks stops him as women walks past the writing is definitely fabrini captain recognise it
fabrini didn the fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets
yes towards the end the fabrini people lived underground as these people do to protect themselves
some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to another planet and these are their descendants once the coast is clear now spock waves his hand in front of some symbols and the door opens
the oracle doesn seem to know we re here wonder what alerted it the first time
captain if remember correctly the oracle reprehensible conduct was initiated when natira knelt on that platform
think you re right continue investigating the clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere spock reads the wall panels
nothing here which would indicate this is anything but planet there no question but that the creators would be considered gods they spot an unusual obelisk
this plaque is representation of star and its solar system
eight planets captain that is the number in the fabrina solar system
then there no doubt these people are the descendants of the fabrini
and no doubt they ve been in flight on this asteroid ship for ten thousand years the door opens they hide behind the obelisk as natira enters and kneels on the platform
speak
it is natira
yes natira
it is written only the high priestess of the people may select her mate
it is so written
the strangers among us the three visitors there is one called mccoy wish him to remain here as my mate
does he agree to this
have asked him he has not yet given me his answer
he must become one of the people worship the creators and agree to the insertion of the instrument of obedience
he will be told what must be done
if he agrees to all things it is permitted teach him our laws carefully so he commits no sacrilege no offence against the people or the creators
it will be done most wise she gets up opens the door and electricity hits kirk and spock she dashes back to the platform
who are the intruders
two of the strangers kirk and spock
mccoy is not with them
no
kirk and spock have committed sacrilege you know what must be done
know guards run in when the oracle releases them take them fools you think we are children you think you can do as you please commit whatever offence amuses you
what are you going to do to my friends
they entered the oracle room
and the punishment is death
yes can make no other decision we gave them our trust they betrayed us
they acted out of ignorance natira
they said they came in friendship
please let them return to the ship
cannot
for me ve made my decision staying here on yonada natira what they did they did because they felt they had to please let them return to the ship you won regret it how do you think feel if stayed here with the chance to be happy for the first time in my life but knowing my friends had died
yes so be it this will do for mccoy for our happiness and future mccoy hands communicators to kirk and spock
you re returning with us
no not
bones this isn planet it space ship on collision course with daran five
on kind of collision course myself jim
doctor mccoy order you to return with us
and refuse
bones if we can correct the course of this ship we ll have to blast it out of space
intend to stay on this ship with these people whatever happens
your decision is most illogical doctor
is it mister spock is it really natira asked me to stay and staying
as her husband
yes is that too much to ask jim
kirk to enterprise
we re beaming over lock in on our signal
and transport mister spock and myself immediately
he staying scotty kirk out mccoy is kneeling on the platform
to become one of the people of yonada the instrument of obedience must be made part of your flesh do you now give your consent
do
proceed
say now because once done it is done
let it be done she touches his head with the device in her hands
you are now one with my people she kneels beside him may give you the love you want and make the time you have beautiful
we re now of one mind
one heart
one life they kiss
it is done most wise our living link with the creators
teach him then what he must know as one of the people natira takes mccoy to the obelisk that kirk and spock were looking at when they got caught she touches three of the planets and it opens to reveal white-covered book
this is the book of the people to be opened and read when we reach the new world of the promise it was given by the creators
do the people know the contents of their book
only that it tells of our world here and why soon one day we must leave it for the new world
has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you
no it has not
don you long to know its secrets
no it is enough for me to know that we shall understand all when we reach our home captain log stardate 5476 we are on parallel course with yonada it is still on collision course with daran five our failure to correct its course and the critical nature of doctor mccoy illness made the extraordinary event of contact with starfleet command imperative with your wish to stay but hope you recognise the necessity that you continue your mission at once
that is the problem sir restate it you have been relieved of all responsibility for the asteroid ship yonada starfleet command will take care of the situation end of conversation
believe it time to move on
yes those are the orders
kirk here
put him on
yes bones
you ve located the controls
no but ve seen the book that contains all the knowledge of the creators and if you he gets warning pain but fights through it
if you can get to it spock
where is it mccoy collapses crying out in pain
bones are you all right natira runs in bones what is it mccoy what happening what happening mccoy short while later kirk and spock beam in
you are killers of your friend will have you put to death
help him
until you are dead he will think of you and disobey will see you die
spock take care of mccoy kirk drags natira away so spock can remove the instrument of obedience
in tears he is not part of our people you ve released him from his vow of obedience
we have freed him from the cruelty of your oracle
mccoy
bones bones you said something about book where is it
they must not know
the oracle room
you will never see the book it is sacrilege guards guards guards
now listen to me you must listen to what have to say give me one moment to speak to you one moment natira if you don believe what about to tell you you can call the guards we ll accept any punishment you decree
what do you wish to say
you must believe that what about to tell you is the truth
your truth of your world
yes my world and your world of yonada
you don obey the law of the creators how can you understand my world
understand understand natira ten thousand years ago sun was dying and with it its world it the world you see on the plaque in the room of the oracle
that is world of which yonada is part
no it is the world of your ancestors your creators it no longer exists
you are mad
no not now listen to me hear me out when your ancestors discovered that their world was dying they built great ship and chose their best people they wished for their race to survive they sent the ship out into space
you wish me to believe that yonada is ship
yes
but we have sun it did not die at night see the stars
no you are living inside hollow ball your ancestors created it to take you on journey to promised new planet
why should the she gets pain why should the truth wait for you to come to yonada
because flaw developed in the controls and unless we correct it yonada will kill millions of people and destroy world it doesn even know
why should the truth be kept from us why should the creators keep us in darkness no no you do not speak the truth believe only the oracle believe
let us remove the instrument of obedience the way we did for mccoy natira she runs from the room
do you think she understood me spock opens the door looks out nods to passers-by
she evidently understood something there are no guards to detain us
you have listened to the words of the non-believers
yes have listened
that was the first transgression you felt the pain of warning
yes did
why did you listen further
they said they spoke the truth
their truth
is truth not truth for all
the truth of yonada is your truth there can be no other for you repent your disobedience
must know the truth of the world she falls unconscious off the platform kirk mccoy and spock enter mccoy cradles her as she wakes
your friends have told me of your world
they spoke the truth
believe you believe the creators kept us in darkness there nothing can do believe with you husband mccoy removes her instrument of obedience
is she all right
she will be ll stay here with her the book is in the monolith
it is sacrilege to the temple
we do this for the survival of the people of yonada
you are not believers you are forbidden to gaze at the book
we mean no desecration to the faith of yonada we must consult the book to help you
it is blasphemy you are forbidden the punishment is death strong wind blows and some of the panels on the wall glow deep red the air shimmers in the heat
temperature one hundred eleven degrees and rising
mccoy how do you open this thing
temperature one hundred fifteen degrees
press the three lower planets on the left-hand side simultaneously kirk does and takes the book
one hundred twenty degrees
here the plan must be in there is it indexed
yes it is
hurry spock
it refers to the altar apply pressure to the centre until it opens the altar slides forward revealing small door to another room which is also shimmering in the heat room full of 1960 ibm-style computers spock gets to work flipping switches
let get her out of the heat
ve neutralised the heating elements it cools very quickly
we ll be all right here now jim kirk goes to join spock
the oracle can no longer punish us
your friends have prevented it
yes
and will they send this this ship again to the land the creators intended
yes
that is good
active and functional not too different from the enterprise
there seems to be weakness in one of the eight tubes
enough to turn it off course
yes let me check that engine very simple problem easy to correct
then come they stand
no
don be afraid
do not fear the punishment of disobedience well then come we must hurry to join
no cannot go with you it is not fear understand the great purpose of the creators shall honour it
you intend to stay here on yonada
shall stay willingly and because that is what must do
then won leave you
will mccoy stay here to die no mccoy will not let go of life and the fullness of years
now more than ever wish to search through the universe to find cure for myself and others like me and want you to be with me
this is my universe you came here with great mission to save my people shall abandon them perhaps one day if it is permitted you will find yonada again
believe we can attempt the course correction captain
good going back to marked headings
guidance control taking over believe we can allow this ship to go back to its automatic control
steadying on course marked in red
spotting shelves of discs captain intelligence files their banks contain the total knowledge of the fabrini ready for the people to consult when they arrive at their destination scans them and they seem to have amassed great deal of medical knowledge mccoy is on the biobed chapel gives him an injection at spock signal
excellent doctor the white corpuscle count is back to normal mccoy groans
your haemoglobin count is back to normal doctor which indicates that the flow of oxygen to each cell of your body is back up to its abundantly energetic level
thank you mister spock for bringing back the knowledge of the fabrini
doctor mccoy the fabrini descendants are scheduled to debark on their promised planet in approximately three hundred and ninety days think that we could manage to be in that vicinity at that time if you wanted to thank the fabrini personally conifers stand on the slopes down to lake where three figures beam down onto trackway
look at those pine trees
and that lake
swear that honeysuckle smell
swear that little orange blossom thrown in it unbelievable growth exactly like that of earth on planet half galaxy away what are the odds on such duplication
astronomical captain the relative size age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to earth in any way
what in blazes is that bizarre structure on dais with steps leading up to it
analysis spock
an alien metal of some kind an alloy resistant to probe readings can even measure its age accurately these incised symbols are fascinating evidently some form of writing
any theories about what it is
negative captain structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own
meadows and no meteor craters the whole place is an enigma biologically and culturally
what the nearest concentration of life forms mister spock
bearing one one seven mark four
and how much time did you say we have to investigate
if we are to divert the asteroid which is on collision course with this planet we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem perhaps past solution
you did say thirty minutes
yes sir
then let go let find out what life forms are blessed by this environment standing on the opposite side of the lake from collection of tipis and lodge
why they look like swear they re american indians
they are doctor mixture of navajo mohican and delaware believe all among the more advanced and peaceful tribes
it like discovering atlantis or shangri-la mister spock is it possible there more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet one capable of building that obelisk or developing deflector system
highly improbable captain sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here
shouldn we contact them jim tell them
tell them what that an asteroid coming to smash their world into atoms
too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight doctor our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them
we ve got job to do let get back to the enterprise along the path
what the matter jim
what oh nothing it just so peaceful uncomplicated no problems no command decisions just living
typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting back in the twentieth century we referred to it as the tahiti syndrome it particularly common to over-pressured leader types like starship captains
ah the tahiti syndrome let go take care of that asteroid but first want another look at that obelisk kirk walks up to it as mccoy scans with the tricorder
doctor
yes
suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid
standing next to the symbols kirk to enterprise and drops suddenly out of our sight inside the obelisk chamber kirk starts to stand and is hit by and electrical discharge he collapses across control panel captain log stardate 4842 first officer spock commanding numerous search parties and repeated sensor probes of the area have failed to locate captain kirk spock is standing where kirk was when he disappeared
spock to enterprise
prepare to beam us up mister scott we re warping out of orbit
leaving you can be serious spock
doctor that asteroid is almost as large as your earth moon far enough away the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute but as the asteroid approaches this planet the angle becomes so great that even the power of starship
the devil with an asteroid it won get here for two months spock
if we arrive at the deflection point in time it may not get here at all
in the meantime what about jim
once the asteroid has been diverted we ll return here and resume the search
that may be hours from now he may be injured or dying
picking up two stoned to illustrate his point doctor assume this is the planet we re on this is the approaching asteroid if we don get to that deflection point in time it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid in that case everyone on this planet will die including the captain
can few more minutes matter spock
in the time it taken me to explain the problem the asteroid has moved from here to here the longer we delay the less the likelihood of being able to divert it beam us up mister scott place is this what are these phaser and communicator feel should know they re familiar and yet unfamiliar how did get here who am try to remember he finds flight of stairs and walks up out into the sunshine two young women are approaching carrying baskets of food
wait they kneel at the sight of kirk then one gets up and walks up the steps to him and puts his hand to her forehead
who are you
we are your people we ve been waiting for you to come to us captain log stardate 4843 first officer spock commanding we ve been en route to the asteroid for several hours our delay on the planet surface has made it imperative that we proceed at maximum warp speed for period which exceeds the recommended safety margin
can give you warp nine much longer mister spock these engines are beginning to show signs of stress
stress or not we cannot reduce speed do not intend to miss that
all right but we re moving further into the danger range all the time
objection noted mister scott carry on
miramanee has said that you appeared to her and to her handmaiden from the walls of the temple just as our legend foretells we do not doubt the words of our priestess but these are troubled times and we must be sure
ll answer anything can but as told you many things are strange to me
he knows nothing of our danger how could he save us
it is against custom to interrupt tribal elder at council even for the medicine chief
elder words will not save us when the skies darken we must be certain say he must prove he is god
our skies have darkened three times since the harvest the last time worst of all our legend predicts such danger and promises that the wise ones who planted us here will send god to save us one who can rouse the temple spirit and make the sky grow quiet can you do this
came from the temple as miramanee said and it was beginning for me here but came from the sky too only can remember can remember
salish terrible thing has happened the boy was attending the fishnets and he became entangled in them and sank to the bottom of the river lumo brought him up quickly but he doesn move
there is no sound in the body there is no light in the eyes he will move no more
wait moment kirk gives the kiss of life
wait kirk massages the boy legs and he coughs waking up
he ll be all right now
my people are grateful
it simple technique it goes way back way back
only god can breathe life into the dead do you still question give him the medicine badge miramanee takes the headband with the metal disc from salish head and puts it on kirk they all salute him the enterprise has arrived at the asteroid
deflection point minus seven
the relays will reject the overload mister spock
then bypass the relays and go to manual control
want full power mister scott
all right you lovelies hold together full power mister spock
magnification factor twelve mister sulu
aye sir
deflection point minus four
all engines stop hold position here
prepare to activate deflectors
aye sir
power dropping sir the lights dim
engineering maintain full power full power replace it
not now
zero deflection point now sir
activate deflectors beam shoots out and pulses against the big lump of rock
power dropping sir
degree of deflection mister sulu
not enough mister spock it only point zero zero one three degrees
recircuit power to engines maximum speed heading three seven mark zero one zero
aye sir
that heading will put us directly in the asteroid path sir
correct mister chekov intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams
what for
to destroy it narrow beam concentrated on single spot will split that mass
it might also cripple the ship and we would be crushed by the asteroid
incorrect we ll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power
jim won be able to get out of its path
that doctor is another calculated risk we must take miramanee has just filled skin with water
miramanee what are you doing
must see to the needs of the god as is my duty
you should be working on our ritual cloak
there will be no ritual between us now salish
what do you mean we cannot go against tradition
it is because of tradition that cannot marry you
but you are promised to me
that was before he came
tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined
he is medicine chief now salish choose another any maiden would be honoured to join with you
wish no other
you have no choice
miramanee if you could choose would you choose me she lowers her eyes and walks away kirk is carving hole in gourd
perhaps you would like to bathe now
miramanee tell me about the wise ones
tell but god knows everything
not this one tell me
the wise ones brought us here from far away they chose medicine chief to keep the secret of the temple and to use it when the sky darkens
secrets of the temple
there are no lacings his uniform top how is this thing removed
the secrets were passed on from father to son
yes how does this open
well why doesn salish use it why are the people in danger
his father did not wish to share his power too soon he died before he told salish the secret two young women enter with trays of fruit then the tribal elder comes in
our people rejoice and wish to honour your name but did not know what you wish to be called what may tell them
ki kir
kirok the women leave
have we displeased you
no no everything is fine
then it must be ourselves the way we live perhaps we have not improved as quickly as the wise ones wish
your land is rich your people happy who could be displeased with that
but there is something tell us we will change it
can tell you anything all can tell you is that happy and peaceful here not sure but think ve never felt that way before the elder leaves
why are they so sure can help them
well you came from the stone metal did you not bring life to the child
yes but need time to remember
here there is much time for everything
co-ordinates mister chekov
tau eight point seven beta point zero four one
that is our target the asteroid weakest point
almost dead centre sir
lock all phasers on that mark maximum intensity narrow beam want to split that fissure wide open
you sound like you re cutting diamond
very astute doctor
all phasers locked sir
we ll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as mister scott can maintain power
standing by sir
fire phasers
phaser one firing
that vulcan won be satisfied till these panels are puddle of lead
main relay out again mister scott
phaser four firing all phasers fired sir
rig for simultaneous firing mister sulu commence simultaneous bombardment there are flashes and sizzling sound from the engines then they go dark
my bairns my poor bairns kirk is dressed in decorated buckskins
the ritual cloak is finished if it pleases you would like to name the joining day
the joining day
the daughter of the chief tribal law betroths me to our leader if there is another will step aside
no miramanee there no one else in my mind or my heart
god wish is above tribal law
name the joining day
the sooner our happiness together begins the longer it will last tomorrow they kiss an image of the obelisk is on the monitor spock looks as if he is meditating upon it star drive is completely burned out the only thing we have left is impulse power
estimated repair time
hanging here in space forever darlings is the nearest repair base
ve already surmised that thank you mister scott
well spock you took your calculated risk in your calculated vulcan way and you lost you lost for us you lost for that planet and you lost for jim
accept the responsibility doctor
and my responsibility is the health of this crew you ve been driving yourself too hard and want you to get some rest
mister chekov resume heading eight eight three mark four one
back to that planet without warp speed it ll take months spock
exactly fifty nine point two two three days doctor and that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way
well then what the use we might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive we might not be able to save anything including this ship you haven heard word ve said all you ve been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk
another calculated vulcan risk doctor miramanee is attended by three young women preparing her for her wedding
this joining means the end of darkness
it time for joy for all my people kirk is having ritual signs painted on his face
you will wait until walk the holy path to the earth lodge first to give me time to tell the priestess that you follow and that the joining will take place he leaves kirk to rejoice in his new life happiness salish blocks kirk way he has knife
get out of my way salish
even though you be god kirok cannot permit this joining
nobody asking for your permission
then you must strike me dead
have no intention of striking you dead salish cuts kirk hand
you bleed you bleed kirok behold god who bleeds behold god who bleeds they fight and kirk gets salish pinned to the ground
kill me kill me kirok for will not rest until prove to my people that you are no god kirk throws down the knife and walks away in the earth lodge kirk is dressed in the cloak of many coloured feathers and he and miramanee stand in front of the elder
thought you were reporting to sickbay
there isn time doctor must decipher those obelisk symbols they re highly advanced form of cipher writing
you ve been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet fifty eight days
aware of that doctor also aware when we arrive at the planet we ll have barely four hours to effect rescue believe those symbols are the key
well you won read them by killing yourself you ve hardly eaten or slept for weeks now if you don let up you re going to collapse
am not hungry doctor and under stress we vulcans can do without sleep for weeks
well your vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured and as for the pressure that green ice water you call blood
my physical condition is not important doctor that obelisk is
well my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt you re blaming yourself for crippling this ship just as we blamed you well we were wrong so were you you made command decision jim would have done the same my prescription is rest now do have to call the security guards to enforce it spock goes and lies on his bed mccoy leaves spock gets up again and returns to his study of the symbols bare-chested kirk is chasing laughing miramanee through the trees
miramanee come here miramanee he catches her and they kiss
each time your arms hold me is as joyous as the first
happy so happy if it weren for the dreams my mind would be completely at peace
thought you no longer had the dreams that you no longer saw the strange lodge which moves through the sky
they ve come back they were gone for while but they ve come back and see faces too very dim feel should know know them feel my place is with them not here don deserve this happiness
have gift for you
gift what
it may make you happy wait with each passing day however the dreams return every night fragments of memories can almost get hold of them and then miramanee returns with what native american women carry their babies in
bear your child
you they embrace again kirk has made puddle in the mud floor of their home and is explaining irrigation to miramanee
canal and with it we ll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge and we can expand the system and irrigate the fields and double the food supply
and with the power of the lamp lamp
lamp
which turns night into day we can cook twice as much food and as you taught us pre
preserve
preserve
preserve miramanee@ for times of famine that is why you made the lamp kirok so that would never know when it was night and would be forever cooking
oh no no no no no no that not why made the lamp at all to keep you forever cooking thunder and lightning as they kiss then wind starts up
it only the wind and the thunder
act like stupid child have nothing to fear you are here she looks outside it is time kirk; time
to go to the temple the people will be waiting
why
to save them
but it only the wind the wind can harm them
the wind is only the beginning soon the sky will darken the lake will go wild and the earth will tremble only you can save us
but can do anything about the wind or the sky
if we don go now it will be too late you must go inside the temple and make the blue flame come out
don know how to get inside the temple
but you are god
bursting in kirok kirok
why are you not at the temple kirok soon the ground will begin to tremble the people need your help
we ll go to the caves it ll be safe there
the caves surely legend can do more than that for his people
when the ground trembles the caves are not safe kirok if you do not rouse the temple spirit we will all die
there is nothing you cannot do my husband
well what do you wait for god your robes
take care of miramanee salish watches from distance as kirk beats on the obelisk wall trying to work out how to get inside
am kirok have come am kirok salish smiles at his failure spock is playing his lyre
prescribed sleep
you prescribed rest doctor the symbols on the obelisk are not words they are musical notes
musical notes you mean it nothing but song
in way yes other cultures among them certain vulcan offshoots use musical notes as words the tones correspond roughly to an alphabet
were you able to make sense our of the symbols
yes the obelisk is marker just as thought it was left by super-race known as the preservers they passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them so to speak where they could live and grow
ve always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy
so have apparently the preservers account for number of them
that probably how the planet has survived all these centuries the preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet
which has now become defective and is failing to operate
and we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order otherwise
precisely doctor salish has brought crowd armed with stones
there the false one they throw their stones at kirk
die die die
no no don hurt him salish holds her back
miramanee
don hurt him he can save us
he false
belong to him
then go go die with your false god
you ll be killed kill him we re all doomed die impostor you lied to us you re not god we ll kill you now spock and mccoy beam down as miramanee and kirk fall under the hail of stones the crowd runs away when they see them mccoy checks kirk first
need nurse chapel
spock to enterprise
we ve located the captain beam down nurse chapel with an emergency surgical kit
my wife is she all right
wife
hallucinations chapel beams down
miramanee spock rolls miramanee onto her back and chapel gives her an injection
the nurse has given you something to ease the pain why were you being stoned
kirok could not get back into the temple
naturally since he did not come from there
saw him come come
does he recognise us
his brain is unimpaired everything else is functionally normally except his memory
can you help him
it take time
time doctor mccoy is the one thing we do not have in abundance communicator beeps spock here margin
report noted doctor is he strong enough for the vulcan mind fusion
we have no choice so spock places his hands on kirk face and starts the procedure
am spock you are james kirk our minds are moving closer closer closer closer james kirk closer
no
james kirk
miramanee no miramanee
our minds are one
am kirok am kirok
am kir
am kirok am
spock he breaks the link
what is it
his mind he is an extremely dynamic individual
it worked kirk goes to miramanee
captain were you inside this structure
yes what inside is loaded with scientific equipment
this obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism it is imperative that we get inside immediately captain we do not have much time
mccoy mccoy and chapel start tending to miramanee
don know how to get inside
if we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes this entire planet will be destroyed
the key must be in these symbols we ve got to decipher them
already have to some extent captain they are musical notes
you mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on musical instrument
that would be one method another would be series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence
give me your communicator tonal control consonants and vowels must have hit it accidentally when contacted the ship
if you could remember your exact words captain
flipping open the communicator kirk to enterprise the hatch slides open with miramanee still lying on it
scotty if the deflector isn activated within twenty minutes get out of orbit get the enterprise out of the danger zone the landing party is expendable the enterprise isn kirk out miramanee bones stay with her do what you can
it is similar to deflector panels ve seen captain but far more complicated
careful must have hit something accidentally beam caught me and that when stopped remembering
probably memory beam you must have activated it out of sequence
more symbols can you read them
do have an excellent eye for musical notes captain they would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper
spock just press the right button spock presses the middle button of row of three and other sections light up blue beam shoots out of the top of the obelisk and pushes the asteroid away
how is she
she had bad internal injuries jim
will she live
no
in pain kirok it is true you are safe
and so are your people miramanee
knew you would save them my chief when am better it will be as it was will it not
if that what you want
we will live long and happy lives will bear you many strong sons ll love you always
and ll love you miramanee always he kisses her
each kiss is as the first she dies captain log stardate 5725 the enterprise is en route to memory alpha it is planetoid set up by the federation solely as central library containing the total cultural history and scientific knowledge of all planetary federation members with us is specialist lieutenant mira romaine she is on board to supervise the transfer of newly designed equipment directly from the enterprise to memory alpha
you re the sanest the smartest the nicest woman that has ever come aboard this ship
anything else
anything else ll keep to myself for the moment of his life is suddenly revealed to him his whole heart once throbbed only to the ship engines he could talk only to the ship now he can see nothing but the woman
didn think mister scott would go for the brainy type
don think he even noticed she has brain
mister scott mister scott
turning from mira hmm
as soon as we re within viewing range of memory alpha you and lieutenant romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor you ll prepare for direct transfer of equipment
aye captain
we re ready sir
lieutenant may offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the federation
yes good luck lieutenant
thank you
captain picking up high intensity reading
is that memory alpha
no sir there bright thing in the middle of the viewscreen an engineer touches scott arm to attract his attention
excuse me
magnification eight what is that
indications are storm captain although ve never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation
readings
all sensor readings are at maximum calibration
captain it approaching at warp factor two point six and accelerating
check that no natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light
it is definitely doing so captain therefore it cannot be phenomenon of nature
deflectors on condition yellow
condition yellow sir
shields activated captain the bright thing invades the ship with sparkles only mira does not shield her eyes from it then the sparkles withdraw
mister sulu get us the devil out of here full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the bridge lieutenant all decks damage report mira gently falls to the floor
mira
doctor mccoy to the bridge emergency emergency
mira mira her eyes and mouth are open what that you re saying mccoy enters
was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance
don know did you notice scotty
well after the disturbance was over she just collapsed how she doing doctor
well think she coming around now
easy now easy you had quite fall
fine
you let me be the judge of that do you feel like walking to sickbay
fine doctor really am is everybody else all right
aye they are now you just do what doctor mccoy ordered
why feel
get to sickbay lieutenant that an order
yes sir
captain would it be all right if went along to sickbay
no mister scott stay at your post for the moment
but captain
lieutenant uhura damage report
yes sir all stations are operative sir
mister spock
some equipment was temporarily out of order my sensors were inoperative
any damage to the warp engines
none captain
good from the action of that storm we ll need all the speed we can get
captain it was not storm
captain during the disturbance memory alpha was hailing wanted to respond but couldn make my hand move
captain it was not hands that were paralysed it was eyes could not force my eyes to look down and set new course
no it was speech that was affected couldn utter sound
mister spock explanation
only of the result not of the cause in each case different area of the brain was affected our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure
or attack
attack might be more precise formulation captain
and lieutenant romaine seems most susceptible
are the readings corresponding nurse
everything appears normal doctor
thank you scott enters
what that you re doing nurse
recording your responses in this computer
but why haven had single response worth noting
lieutenant please
well have
lieutenant there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship you re the only one that passed out and want to know why
want to know why too you re the doctor you tell me this is new experience for me
this whole thing is new experience for all of us
all of you are accustomed to new experiences it part of your work not
she might have something there doctor mccoy this is her first deep space trip and you know that affects people
well if we can get on with this scotty we might make that determination now then tell me what did you feel before you passed out
nothing
nothing
absolutely nothing
lieutenant
doctor there is nothing more can tell you
lieutenant you re being completely unco-operative
are you putting that into my record it not true
ll put the facts into your record if can get them
come on now mira we must help the doctor tell us what happened
perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in starfleet requires discipline and co-operation
sure that what the lieutenant wants she just didn understand did you now lass mccoy leaves
with bedside manner like that scotty you re in the wrong business chapel leaves
when the record of this is forwarded ll be sent back won
oh you will not that ridiculous this getting used to space travel that takes some doing and not everybody takes to it
did you
well me that different was practically born to it
want to continue
you will you passed your starfleet preliminary examinations and this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs
hope that all it is
captain ve plotted the storm path
main screen projection
on its present course it will hit memory alpha planetoid as it did us
lieutenant try and warn memory alpha of the proximity of that phenomena give me an eta for its possible impact
cannot sir it has the ability to change speed
sir unable to establish contact with the planetoid hailing on all frequencies no response
it is of little consequence captain memory alpha has no protective shields
no shields
none captain when the library complex was assembled shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose since the information on the memory planet is available to everyone special protection was deemed unnecessary
wonderful hope the storm is aware of that rationale
completing approach to planetoid
it is already over memory alpha captain its speed is incredible it hitting the planetoid
are we within orbit range mister chekov
making final approach
lieutenant try and warn them of
sorry sir can break through this interference
mister spock how many people are on memory alpha
it varies with the number of scholars researchers and scientists from the various federation planets who are using the computer complex
captain we are within orbit range
lock into orbit
aye sir
it is leaving memory alpha captain
sensors give no readings of generated energy from memory alpha captain
any life readings
none
let find out what going on down there kirk to engineering mister scott report kirk to engineering mister scott where the devil is he scotty report to the bridge report to the bridge have the transporter room stand by taking landing party down
aye aye sir
scotty where ve you been where are you
in the sickbay
are you sick
och no was just checking on the lass she going to be fine now there nothing wrong with her
well relieved to hear your prognosis mister scott is the doctor there with you or will find him in engineering
mccoy here jim
think she in good shape meet me in the transporter room on the double mccoy and scott leave then we see in mira eye the sparkles and an image of dead alien presumably on memory alpha captain log supplemental stardate 5725 the storm has cleared memory alpha it is heading away at incredible speed we have been unable to make contact with the planetoid its silence is ominous we are beaming down to investigate
somehow find transporting into the darkness unnerving
scotty can you get us some more light
afraid this light ll have to do captain the generator is inoperative
damage report spock
disaster for the galaxy captain the central brain is damaged the memory core is burned out the loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable
captain they go into the next area and find the body we saw in mira eye along with others
very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity captain
locate him and keep him alive we need more information about this enemy mccoy finds her on the floor around corner
over here captain
bones can you do something
not thing jim the woman mouth is moving the same garbled sounds lieutenant romaine made when she fainted after the storm
are you sure
absolutely sure
kirk to enterprise
beam down lieutenant romaine immediately the woman face turns different vivid colours
spock have you seen anything like that before
negative
bones
she dead
what did she die of
severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems dissolution of autonomic nervous system all basic personality factors captain
the attack was thorough
what did the others die of
each had different centre of brain destroyed cause unknown
different centre of the brain you say
yes captain can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship computers mira beams in
mira the captain has some questions
yes captain
lieutenant when you were unconscious you were speaking
what did say
don know the words were unfamiliar to me
what did it sound like
they sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician
what technician
we found one person in there just barely alive the rest were dead and we mira runs to see
lieutenant lieutenant
we must get back to the ship
why tell me why
that storm it returning
how do you know
know you ll be killed if we stay
lieutenant assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet it is probably seeking other victims
tell you will kill us
enterprise to captain kirk
kirk here scanner and is closing fast
what its course
beam us up the four men materialise on the pads
mister sulu this is the captain get the enterprise out of here
wait captain we ve lost mira
delay that order mister sulu
stabilise her
something interfering with the transporter signal have her co-ordinates but she suspended in transit
let me finally mira arrives feeling dizzy
all right mister sulu get us out of here mister scott check emergency manual monitor for transporter control
captain it changing course
plot the new course mister chekov
present course is one two six mark twenty
plot it present course will bring it across our starboard side sir
mister spock you made statement that phenomenon is not storm explain
no known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon
what is it
having difficulty with the ship sensors they seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of memory alpha were
then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted
ship sensors are operating at the moment perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself
saw those men dead in their exact positions
listen to me ve told you what strange tricks space trip can play on your mind now that all it is
no scotty
have you ever had visions of the future events before this
never
well if you ask me nobody ever has that seeing to the future it pure bunk you know that don you
ve always believed it
and you were perfectly right
then what is it scotty what frightening me ever since that storm hit ve ve had such strange thoughts such feelings of terror
space space that all it is
then don have to report it
well if you want to spend the rest of the trip in sickbay but what good would that do doctor mccoy can no more cure it than he can cold
captain it heading straight for us
activate shields
shields activated
mister chekov change course to one four three mark three
one four three mark three
storm course mister sulu
one four three mark three
take evasive action
evasive action
hard starboard two one seven mark five
two one seven mark five still with us sir
hard port one one seven mark two
one one seven mark two still with us sir
is it closing
negative captain maintaining its distance however it is matching each manoeuvre we execute and am receiving increasing magnitude of energy
your analysis spock what is it
not what is it captain what are they there are ten distinct life units within it all powerfully alive and vital
who are they where are they from
impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis
it clear we can outrun them can we shield against them
do not believe the enterprise shields would prove an effective defence
there must be some defence we can use
captain we are dealing with community of life units their attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain which is most compatible
maybe we can avoid another attack lieutenant uhura open all channels tie in the universal translator mister spock says it alive maybe can talk to it
all channels open translator tied in
this is captain james kirk of the uss enterprise we wish you no harm physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms please do not come any closer to our ship
perhaps it did not understand
captain change in velocity recorded they are passing our starboard side and manoeuvreing in front of us switching to forward scanner captain change in velocity recorded it has accelerated its approach
help scotty
what
hold me it happening again no
mira
perhaps it understands another kind of language condition red alert prepare for phaser firing
mira
no scotty no no scott holds her close
lock in phaser tracking controls locked in sir
adjust phasers to fire across its course do not hit it
locked in sir
fire reaction mister sulu
none sir they re still approaching us
apparently shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community
locked in sir
fire mira falls to the floor clutching her stomach in pain
scotty
mira mira
the phasers seem to have stopped their approach they re holding position
lock in for another blast
locked in sir
killing lieutenant romaine
aye when you fired the phasers they stunned her and she crumpled
get her to sickbay at once
ready for firing captain
cancel that order another attack on that alien life form will kill lieutenant romaine
it appears so
if she is to survive we can attack
not directly
can the computer supply defence based on the data you ve been accumulating
negative captain have not been able to gather sufficient data for that captain there is only one possible defence if we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form
and yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects captain kirk to doctor mccoy
is the girl well enough to be questioned
have the lieutenant and mister scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible bring all available biographical material with you kirk out mister spock come with me
go easy on her jim she in pretty bad state
ll try scott and mira enter
lieutenant romaine
didn mean to be unco-operative doctor
of course you didn told the captain
we must get to understand what is happening
ll tell you everything know
ship investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to new crewman don let us upset you
trust all of you implicitly want to help
this investigation has been prompted by two events first is the time you passed out on the bridge and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you
you mustn worry about hurting me
now this is how we ll proceed mister spock has all the information available to us about our attackers doctor mccoy has access to starfleet exhaustive files on you comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves all right gentlemen doctor mccoy will you proceed
romaine mira lieutenant place of birth martian colony number three parents lydia romaine deceased jacques romaine chief engineer starfleet retired
mister spock are you prepared with the background history of the attackers
am captain have fed all obtainable data to the main computer it should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible
thank you mister sulu what is the status of our friends the same distance
continue evasive manoeuvres keep me informed kirk out doctor do you have medical record of lieutenant romaine available
yes captain
like few items from her psychological profile checked any history of psychosomatic illness
occasional and teenage routine incidents
any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities
none
any pathological or unusual empathic responses
no captain not empathic however an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked
go ahead doctor
after our phasers hit that thing gave lieutenant romaine standard steinman analysis the results might be interesting
go ahead
the comparison of our steinman with starfleet records shows that lieutenant romaine fingerprints voice analysis all external factors remain exactly the same as before however according to two hyperencephalograms her brain wave pattern has been altered
that impossible
that what was taught but the bcp is just as consistent as fingerprints
let see it jagged graph comes up on the monitor spock raises an eyebrow
doctor mccoy according to your records lieutenant romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers
that right spock but exceptional pliancy was indicated that might be factor
and you are sure that this is the correct slide
yes mister spock that is tape deck brain circuitry pattern of lieutenant mira romaine
gentlemen it also happens to be tape the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units
nurse chapel followed this every step of the way there can be no error
check it spock spock puts his computer disc in and the two patterns overlap and match exactly
as said captain this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run computer run detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns tape and tape
comparison tape brain circuitry patterns of lieutenant mira romaine and tape brain circuitry patterns of alien life unit identical identical
fascinating
there has been no error
doctor mccoy is correct captain there is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of lieutenant romaine their thoughts are becoming hers
bridge to captain kirk distance
continue evasive action keep me informed kirk out
mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance
why didn you report it
you don report space sickness that all thought it was
what did she see
the first attack on the ship the attack on memory alpha and the time we nearly lost her
those were all acts carried out by our attacker
and and
yes scotty what else
thought for moment there was something else but guess was wrong
was he wrong lieutenant
yes there was one other time
what did you see
saw scotty
where
don know
what was he doing
he was dying now understand what been happening ve been seeing through another mind ve been flooded with thoughts not my own that control me oh scotty scotty rather die than hurt you rather die scott@ all right now what all this talk of dying they ve called the turn on us three out of four times now that better average than anybody deserves it our turn now we ll fight them so let not hear anything more about dying
kirk here
what success did you have
at their present force they will get through the shields this time captain
warp eight mister sulu
they ll be here very soon they may destroy you and us as they did memory alpha you are especially susceptible to their will but we have one chance to survive don resist let them begin to function through you if we can control that moment we have chance will you try
tell me what to do
captain kirk to medical lab
prepare the antigrav test units let go
attention all personnel attention alien force has penetrated the ship personnel the alien being has penetrated the ship take defensive action alert repeat general quarters security condition three intruder alert
as soon as she has entered the gravity chamber secure all ports the pretty lights enter the room
don touch me scotty stay away then enter mira she changes colour and makes the strange noise
we ve lost her to them
stay where you are
she could kill us all in this state
she will unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned
stay with us mira please stay
trying want to be with you they are too strong
don lose yourself to them hold on
am mira romaine will be who choose to be will stay away scotty they are with me they will kill you
you won let them
through mira she cannot stop us you cannot prevent it
mira mira captain
that not mira talking
captain we must deal with them directly now while she still retains partial identity we can speak to them they will answer using her voice
captain james kirk of the spaceship enterprise do you understand
yes we understand you we have searched for millennium for one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives
who are you
we are from zetar
that is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed
you can be from zetar all life was destroyed there long ago
yes all corporeal life was destroyed
then what are you
the desires the hopes the mind and the will of the last hundred of zetar the force of our life could not be wiped out
all things die
at the proper time our planet was dying we were determined to live on at the peak of our plans to go sudden final disaster struck us down but the force of our lives survived at last we have found someone through whom we can live it out
the body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead
she will accept ours
she will not she is fighting for her own identity
her mind will accept our thoughts our lives will be fulfilled
will she learn the way people on memory alpha learned
we did not wish to kill
but you did kill
no resisting us killed those people we did not kill them
the price of your survival is too high
we only want the girl
you can have her you re entitled to your own life but not another
life was given to me it is mine want to live it out will
the girl life reading is becoming match to the zetarians she losing
do not fight us
they will not accept their own deaths
they ll be forced to accept it
you will all die
captain if we cannot complete the plan they will carry out their threat
we must get her into the pressure chamber
jim you realize the pressure needed to kill the zetars might kill the girl too
mira will not kill me scott picks her up and gets her into the chamber before being thrown across the room
told you she wouldn kill me
secure the chamber neutralise gravity
the zetars are growing stronger
the weightless state has become their natural condition
pressurise the unit bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second continue increasing pressure pressure spock pressure
the pressure is dangerously high captain it may damage her
continue spock the lights leave mira
pressure the lights fizzle away
we ve done it jim they re gone
intercom it all right mira they re gone they re gone she looks at him and smiles
reduce the pressure very very gradually spock
we may tax mister scott patience doctor
lie perfectly still lieutenant try not to move at all take deep regular breaths now don hold it continue to breathe deeply in out in out that it now you ll be in there another twenty minutes so why don you just try to relax
now we have all the time in the world
bones are you able to judge the long range effects on lieutenant romaine
when the personality of human is involved exact predictions are hazardous
particularly where humans are involved doctor
however despite starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the lieutenant she put up valiant struggle to retain her identity and find that encouraging
doctor mccoy is correct captain while the truth was difficult to accept when it was revealed the girl reacted well would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure
would either of you credit scotty steadfast belief in her as factor
you mean love as motivation humans do claim great deal for that particular emotion suppose it is possible however
there are no howevers about it mister spock it was factor and it will be factor in the girl recovery
do take it both of you agree that lieutenant romaine need not return to starbase for further treatment
well should think work would be better therapy
logical
captain kirk to mister scott
mister scott how lieutenant romaine
yes mister scott do take it you say that she is fit for duty
thank you kirk to bridge
mister sulu set course for memory alpha lieutenant romaine has lot of work to do there
well this is an enterprise first doctor mccoy mister spock and engineer scott find themselves in complete agreement can stand the strain captain log stardate 5784 we are responding to desperate distress calls from an unknown planet my science officer mister spock is unable to account for this since he reported no signs of life on the planet it is rich in kironide deposits very rare and long-lasting source of great power kirk spock and mccoy have beamed down into place of greek columns and plenty of marble from the spaceship enterprise
that right the huge shadow is an optical illusion the person who walks in is dwarf with normal voice
alexander at your service sing dance play all variety of games and good loser very good loser please sir try to bear that in mind now would you please accompany me
who are the inhabitants of this planet
oh platonians sure you ve never heard of us our native star is sahndara millennia ago just before it went nova we managed to escape our leader liked plato ideas plato platonius see in fact our present philosopher-king parmen sometimes calls us plato children although we sometimes think of ourselves more as plato stepchildren excuse me someone waiting for you he stiffens and scurries off backwards as if dragged by an invisible leash the landing party follow man is lying on couch
welcome to our republic whom among you is the physician
am what the problem
my spouse his leg come this way
well what happened to that leg
suppose scratched it
don understand this should have been attended to immediately
sheer ignorance is there anything you can do
well we re certainly going to try the infection is massive let me give you hypo to ease the pain mccoy opens pouch and the hypo flies out on it own
where
in the arm the injection is given without human hand
philana they came to help they deserve better than to die his hand is stuffed into his mouth
alexander you talk too much captain log stardate 5784 doctor mccoy is endeavouring to treat the leader of strange group of people when their planet novaed millennia ago they transported themselves to earth in the time of socrates and plato after the death of the greek civilisation they idolised they came to this planet and created for themselves utopia patterned after it
what is it what is your prognosis doctor
ll let you know when have the results and from now on it would be better if handled the instruments without your help
bones can understand why simple cut like that could become so serious
neither do but it has how do knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn show any information on platonius bacteria all can do and this is going to take time is to try to match his bugs with known strain and hope alexander is playing near life-size game like chess with two other men
your pan is in jeopardy
moving an urn by thought it isn now win
well played eraclitus
thank you dioniyde they leave
this psychokinetic power of yours how long have you had it
two and half ever since our arrival here on platonius
how is the power transmitted
brain waves
do these waves cease while you are asleep
no not if they re embedded in the unconscious
what about medicine why no doctors
we haven had any pressing need for the medical arts you see while still on sahndara we instituted mass eugenics programme we re the result pared down to population of thirty eight we re perfect for our utopia we re bred for contemplation and self-reliance and longevity how old would you say am don be afraid not vain
thirty five
that old stopped aging at thirty well anyway you re off by two thousand years two thousand three hundred years old we were married very young was only hundred and seventeen and he was hundred and twenty eight so you see we scarcely have to move anymore let alone work
that why you have no resistance
that right break in the skin or cut can be fatal column falls over and breaks the chess pieces start flying around the room
fascinating believe we re experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of parmen delirium even the enterprise is rocking
scott to captain kirk
kirk to enterprise
captain we re in the midst of storm seen anything like it there
ten scale turbulence right now emergency gyros and stabilisers at maximum last
engines at full speed get her out of orbit and into space
ve tried that sir she locked tight
then there nothing you can do but batten down and weather
right captain
parmen mind is not something flies past them very fast watch it he not only throwing around furniture he tearing up the enterprise as well bones knock him out fast mccoy tries to give the injection but gets flung away by parmen mind alexander gets jerked around too
help save me
alexander stand behind me kirk takes psychic punches
his mind will find me anyhow don save him let him die the others will kill each other trying to take his place
hurry up with that shot
now doctor mccoy is able to give the injection
apparently throttling himself can breathe choking
bones shake him break his concentration parmen passes out and relaxes alexander can breath again
kirk to enterprise
it all right captain the turbulence has abated
good think you ll find the orbit lock is broken as well assess damage and repair whatever is necessary
don know how can ever thank you not only for platonius but for myself
no thanks is necessary
alexander show our guests to the south wing
oh thank you we must return to the ship
think better wait until the fever breaks
well in that case we ll stay
anything you want just ask me anything
thank you alexander
think nothing of it you saved my life think should tell you that
tell me what
well just that never knew any people like you existed
where is everyone
they re all in chambers meditating
alexander are there other platonians like you
what do you mean like me
who don have the psychokinetic ability
thought you were talking about my size because they make fun of me for my size but to answer your question the only one without it was brought here as the court buffoon that why everybody slave and have to be ten places at once and never do anything right
how does one obtain the power
as far as know it just comes to you sometime after you re born they say throwback and am and so are you sorry shouldn have said that
don worry about it we re happy without it
you know believe you are listen where you come from are there lot of people without the power and my size
alexander where come from size shape or colour makes no difference and nobody has the power
nobody somebody wants me and whirling round he is dragged out of the room by that invisible leash of someone mind
captain it will be very gratifying to leave here
that might not be easy should parmen die
even if he shouldn
yes this utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secret in the galaxy screening themselves from our sensors locking us into orbit all this adds up to pattern mccoy enters happy
jim my concoction actually worked the fever broken and what recuperative powers the infection begun to drain already
doctor mccoy you may yet cure the common cold
if ever there was time to get out of here it is now kirk to enterprise scotty come in
scott here sir
afraid can do that sir everything frozen
the turbulence hit you that hard
it not the turbulence sir damage to the ship is minimal
don know sir and those are the facts
did you get up into space
and subspace communication with starfleet it completely severed
all right scotty ll handle it down here stand by alexander is entertaining his master by singing whist playing lyre
great pan sounds his horn marking time to the rhyme with his hoof with his hoof forward forward in our plan we proceed as we began kirk enters alexander sings in greek from aristophanes the frogs
Î²ÏÎµÎºÎµÎºÎµÎºÎµÎ¾ ÎºÎ¿Î±Î¾ ÎºÎ¿Î±Î¾ pronounced bre-ke-ke-kex ko-ax ko-ax thanks larry
your excellency
parmen will do philosopher kings have no need of titles
would like to know why the ship instrumentation and weaponry is frozen and why the enterprise is locked in orbit
captain please you are mistaken assure you
parmen ve talked to the engineer aboard the ship we ve showed our good faith now you show yours want this ship released immediately
the amenities captain allow me to remind you that am the head of this principality guests do not come barging in here making demands and issuing orders kirk phaser flies into parmen hand
guests you don know the meaning of the word guests aren treated like common prisoners
do not take that tone with me kirk is forced to slap his own face repeatedly
kirk to enterprise acknowledge acknowledge enterprise come in enterprise can raise them
obviously parmen does not wish any contact made with the enterprise
he may still need the ship medical stores why prevent contact
to shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of starfleet captain
no mister spock one thing for certain parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety
agreed captain and parmen wouldn have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the enterprise mccoy suddenly stands up stiffly and moves towards the door
where are you going
don know don want to go but can help myself kirk and spock also move as if pulled along by something alexander sounds horn as the door opens and the unwilling three stagger in
gentle spacemen we are eternally in your debt we ve some trifles for you please accept them as tokens of our gratitude they stem from the very source of our inspiration to our noble captain the shield carried by pericles as symbol of gallant leadership the round shield flies to kirk arms
to our silent and cerebral mister spock this kithara to pluck music to soothe his ever-active brow it too flies to him
and lastly to the physician doctor mccoy who saved platonius and my spouse this ancient collection of greek cures penned by hippocrates himself scroll wings it way to mccoy
has the enterprise been released yet
captain wait know what you re thinking my humble apologies you were badly used in my own defence allow me to say that my illness was more profoundly disturbing that myself realised am sure that you too have been out of sorts and have been driven to fits of temper and rage unlike you however what think and feel whether for good or ill is instantly translated into reality so please find it in your heart to forgive me
certainly has the enterprise been released yet
it will be shortly
then good day and thank you for the presents
not at all but there is one final request after my nearly fatal infection it has become obvious to us all that we cannot afford to be without skilled physician therefore we should like you doctor mccoy to remain
very sorry but that impossible
your duties will be extraordinarily light you ll be free to read meditate conduct research whatever you like you ll want for nothing
the answer is no
we should like to keep it cordial but we are determined to have you stay doctor
doctor mccoy saved your life
am losing patience captain
and you consider yourself disciple of plato
we manage to live in peace and harmony
whose harmony yours plato wanted truth and beauty and above all justice
my dear mister spock admit that circumstances have forced us to make few adaptations of plato but ours is the most democratic society conceivable anyone can at any moment be or do anything he wishes even to becoming ruler of platonius if his mind is strong enough
and if his mind isn strong enough he gets torn apart like alexander
oh come now we are not children in your culture justice is the will of the stronger it is forced upon people by means of weapons and fleets of spaceships our justice is the will of the stronger mind and for one consider it vast improvement
we don use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice
farewell captain
come on doctor mccoy
can move jim they re going to keep me here no matter what leave please
no you re the doctor they don want to force you they need your goodwill they re trying
captain go while you still can
we re not leaving until mccoy is released
this is not the enterprise you are not in command captain
why even discuss it get rid of them
no my dear that might offend the good doctor you wish to stay by all means you can help us celebrate our anniversary in the process hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic
you won persuade me
think we will mccoy is pulled over to sit beside parmen and philana laurel wreaths are thrown in front of kirk and spock who are forced to kneel and put them on then standing again they are made to dance around each other and sing this rhyme
tweedledee he tweedledum
two spacemen marching to drum
we slith among the mimsey toves and gyre among the borogoves on their knees again
you re not staying mccoy no matter what he tries to prostrate on the floor
being your slave what should do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you
stop it don do this to him parmen
mccoy no matter what he makes me say or do the answer no
no parmen stop it kirk rolls in agony
well doctor
have my orders
as you wish doctor
is this your utopia your grand vision of the future you don even screams
we ve had enough or your moralising
and we ve had too much of yours ll never get me to stay here
you will be happy to stay it takes little time doctor but you will be happy to stay spock is forced to dance close to kirk head flamenco-style think ending with boot directly over kirk face then spock is allowed to rest and he starts to laugh heartily he crawls over to alexander who cannot help but join in
he vulcan you can force emotion out of him
you must be joking doctor
you ll destroy him
we can let him die laughing can we now spock cries
beg you
spock spock don let them break you hold on don
parmen they saved your life ashamed to be platonian ashamed kirk is on all fours like horse and alexander has to climb on his back and ride him around the room kirk rears and neighs during this
how can you let this go on spock is very withdrawn alexander watches helplessly
can you do anything for him
there is no medicine that can help him he ll have to come through this himself
trust they did not injure you too much captain
my muscles are sore that all
the humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear can understand
the release of emotions mister spock is what keeps us healthy emotionally healthy that is
that may be doctor however have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you
which just goes to prove that there no such thing as perfect solution
so it would seem captain
yes spock
do you still feel anger toward parmen
great anger
and you doctor
yes spock and hatred
then you must release it gentlemen as must master mine might have seriously injured you captain even killed you they have evoked such great hatred in me cannot allow it to go further must master it must control spock breaks goblet with one hand
jim this is senseless ve thought it over staying
you can
parmen has promised me you ll be safe
promised parmen he let us beam up to the enterprise and plunge the ship back into the atmosphere
why why trick me
because if he killed us outright in front of you you retaliate you re doctor you have the means bones know you re trying to do the right thing but if any one of us escaped parmen knows starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay and you sign our death warrant
he right should have warned you they were treating you the same way they treat me just like me only you fight them all the time thought it was me my mind that couldn move pebble they even told was lucky they bothered keep me around at all and believed them the arms and legs of everybody whim look down don meet their eyes smile smile these great people they were gods to me but you showed me what they really are and now know don you see it not me it not my size it them it them it them alexander breaks an urn and takes sharp shard of pottery
put it down
no this is the best thing for them
put it down do what say
going to cut their going to cut them parmen first and they ll all get infected but this time listen whatever they say don save them let them die
give it to me
at least let me give them taste of what they gave me please they re going to kill you anyway you know that
in that case what the point in you dying too alexander give it to me
that the first time anybody ever thought of my life before his own should have told you when you first came here that they were going to kill you because knew but was afraid was afraid
that all right it all right alexander listen we haven given up and there may be something you can do to help
anything can do to help you just tell me
all right did the platonians always have this power
no not until we came to this planet
alexander it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop
how could forget that it was exactly six months and fourteen days after we got here that they started pushing me around
and would you know how many months supplies you brought with you
well four think or three
that close enough alexander fascinating their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods
that right
then it is logical to assume that there is connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods
then why wouldn alexander have the same power as the others
perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element
bones think it be good idea if you took reading of alexander blood
not that afraid or anything but will it hurt much
you won even know it happened
you still have tricorder reading of parmen blood don you
of course parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability and alexander the lowest in the same environmental conditions
the probabilities are that alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to platonius
ll run both their blood samples through for full comparative test on the tricorder
and if our theory works out we ve got weapon
the one significant difference between parmen blood and alexander is concentration of kironide broken down by pituitary hormone
kironide it high-energy source that could be it
the pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis they also regulate body growth
oh you mean the same thing that kept me from having the power made me dwarf
yes it also obvious why parmen kept this little utopia secret anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power
exactly mccoy there must be quick way of building up concentration of kironide in our blood
it ll take some doing but it is possible
what are we waiting for mccoy takes couple of ampoules from his bag then hesitates
what is it bones
even if the kironide reaches the desired effect it still may not help us get out of here
yes there are thirty eight of them
the point is well taken however the psychokinetic power is not additive if it were considering the platonians hostile propensities two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed parmen
he right do you know parmen says each has his own separate power frequency because before when they ve tried to combine their powers and use them together it never worked
ready
let not any waste time give us double the concentration in parmen bloodstream mccoy injects kirk and spock
the time factor concerns me it may take days or even weeks before there enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us
yes what about alexander
since the kironide broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream it should work on him as well as us better in fact because he acclimated
oh no not after what they ve done to me
why not you could conceivably take parmen place and run the whole planet
you think that what want become one of them become my own enemy just lie around like big blob of nothing and have things done for me want to move around for myself if going to laugh or cry want do it for myself you can keep your precious power all ask is one thing if you do make it out of here take me with you just drop me any place they never heard of kironide or platonius
alexander two figures beam in
nurse lieutenant uhura the women try to speak but no sound comes then they turn and leave the room
guess we weren sufficiently entertaining uhura and chapel are dressed in long robes kirk and spock enter in short tunics wearing laurel wreaths
are we ever glad to see you
we were forced in the transporter and beamed down it was like becoming someone puppet
thought was sleepwalking couldn stop myself captain what is it what going on
spock do you feel any effect of the kironide shot
have experienced slight flush captain
so did let try simple test concentrate on raising this plate of fruit nothing shutters draw back to reveal their audience the platonians and mccoy
fellow academicians twenty five hundred years ago band of hearty vagabonds arrived on this barren rough-hewn planet there was desperate hardship of backbreaking toil and then divine providence graced our genius and our dedication with the power of powers and through it our every need instantly materialised we thereupon determined to form utopian brotherhood this night is indeed festive occasion for tonight we welcome into that brotherhood its first new member
not yet parmen you have to convince the doctor first
they ll never do it jim
doctor please you have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies we must recapture it at once know what would be better than serenade from the laughing spaceman spock uhura and chapel are dragged over to couch alexander plucks his lyre
singing take care young ladies and value your wine be watchful of young men in their velvet prime deeply they ll swallow from your finest kegs then swiftly be gone leaving bitter dregs ah bitter dregs with smiling words and tender touch man offers little and asks for so much he loves in the breathless excitement of night then leaves with your treasure in cold morning light ah in cold morning light
and now let the revels begin the four toys are paired up and the furniture moves around chapel and spock on one couch kirk and uhura on the other the men swap then return
oh how faithless and fickle
make up your minds
so ashamed please make them stop
we have tried
please please make them stop
haven the power deeply sorry we ve failed you
for so long ve wanted to be close to you now all want to crawl away and die finally they are forced to kiss
careful mister spock too much love is dangerous
remember cupid arrow kills vulcans general laughter
in kirk arms so frightened captain so very frightened
that the way they want you to feel it makes them think that they re alive
know it but wish could stop trembling
try not to think of them try
thinking thinking of all the times on the enterprise when was scared to death and would see you so busy at your commands and would hear your voice from all the parts of the ship and my fears would fade and now they are making me tremble but not afraid am not afraid as the camera closes in uhura head is turned to obscure our view and the lips don quite touch
parmen let get on with it
you are so impatient my wife observe the doctor and learn he quite content to wait for the piece de resistance table with whip and other weapons slides across kirk and spock approach it kirk takes the whip spock the red-hot poker just as they get to the women kirk turns
you re half dead all of you you ve been dead for centuries we may disappear tomorrow but at least we re living now and you can stand that can you you re half crazy because there nothing inside nothing and you have to torture us to convince yourselves you re superior kirk cracks the whip in front of uhura face alexander creeps away
stop it parmen stop it ll do whatever you want me to do ll stay and serve you but stop it
parmen alexander is frozen in the act of trying to stab parmen
alexander again he likes to play with knives very well we shall indulge him alexander struggles not to stab himself when suddenly he is released
who did that
throwing down the whip did
impossible
quite possible and logical spock throws away the poker
what is this
what going on
platonians listen to me the next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities but at twice your power level
not twice mine parmen controls alexander and sends him to attack kirk but kirk sends him back to and fro he turns until finally the dagger is inches from parmen body
captain no captain beg of you ll do anything you say do not wish to die captain do you hear me
don stop me let me finish him off
do you want to be like him alexander puts down the knife by his own choice parmen is dragged out of his seat
parmen listen to me could have had your power but didn want it could have had your place right now but the sight of you and your academicians sickens me despite your brains you re the most contemptible things that ever lived in this universe
captain you knew that intended to destroy both you and the enterprise yet you spared me
to us killing is murder even for revenge but there will be other starships
there no need for concern they ll be safe of late have begun to think that we ve become bizarre and unproductive we are existing merely to nourish our own power it time for some fresh air we shall welcome your interstellar visits
don believe you
that would be highly uncharacteristic we must expect parmen that the moment we leave here your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you
just remember we can recreate that power in matter of hours so don try anything
understood captain and you re right none of us can be trusted uncontrolled power will turn even saints into savages and we can all be counted upon to live down to our lowest impulses
you re very good at making speeches parmen just make sure that this one sinks in now move aside alexander kirk to enterprise mister scott prepare to beam us up have little surprise for you bringing visitor aboard captain log stardate 5029 responding to distress call from our scientific colony on triacus we are beaming down to investigate on the ground beneath purple sky adults are lying motionless kirk mccoy and spock investigate one man gets up from behind rock
professor starnes the man has phaser and looks terrified it kirk the man collapses without speaking
he dead captain
he didn seem to know me kirk takes the dead man tricorder then goes over to woman and removes vial from her mouth
cyalodin
self-inflicted kirk replays the tricorder within the enemy
all this self-inflicted mass suicide the sound of children playing then the kids run into the scene there girl three small boys and one older boy
you missed me
did not
hi who are you
kirk of the starship enterprise
tommy starnes this is mary steve ray and don
come on play with us come on they make circle and dance around kirk ring around the rosy pocket full of posy ashes ashes we all fall down ring around the rosy pocket full of posy ashes ashes we all fall down captain log supplementary we have buried the members of the starnes exploration party everyone has been deeply affected by what has happened here with some important exceptions grave markers with just surnames stand behind one or two mounds of soil kirk plants ufp standard the children have had enough
let go and play they run off to the cave entrance and play tag
no sign of grief
no jim no indication of any kind
or of fear
they seem completely secure and unafraid
and you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock
don insist jim but can dismiss the possibility
child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead can believe it
humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful
not these children to this extent it incredible
what those children saw is incredible jim the way those deaths occurred any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia that my diagnosis until specific tests can be made it remains that
ll be guided by that opinion doctor for the present what about questioning them
not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour forcing them to see this experience now could cause permanent damage
accepted doctor one of the boys knocks over the ufp standard
careful
sorry captain kirk
children children listen to me it late and it time to go up to the ship
oh not yet
but we re just beginning to have fun
not now
sorry sorry you ll go up with the doctor
come on it time to be going
whatever happened here is locked up inside those children
the attack on professor starnes party must surely have been unprovoked
attack mass suicide is what it seems to be
stand corrected captain induced would be more precise term induced by an outside force
such as
the release of bacteria or helpless mental depression and state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced
what would make the children immune
do not know but it is possible
then the children would have been exempted by conscious design
valid assumption would say
and their present behaviour explained by fear of punishment
or the promise of reward
an attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet this planet is uninhabited mister spock to the best of our information
at present yes his tricorder beeps odd
getting reading
there seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave
picking up any life-forms mister spock
definitely not humanoid captain impossible to make any specific identification the readings do not correlate with any known information
shivers oh that strange that very strange getting feeling of anxiety in this place it doesn sound very scientific does it but it strongest right here
not aware of it captain
maybe that what registering on your tricorder
am not familiar with anxiety but wasn aware it could be registered on sensors
no of course that that me that me but what causing your tricorder to react kirk dashes out of the cave
are you all right captain
yes fine fine just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here let get back to the ship want to check out those tapes from professor starnes tricorder and am going to question those children assume it is although there are lot more plants around the room than we usually see
all right children each card is different flavour you take your pick and the computer will mix your favourite combination now what would you like call out your favourites
vanilla chocolate cherry banana the kids grab cards and dash to the food dispensers
well would you like surprise stevie
he gets his ice cream it coconut and vanilla they re both white
there there now stevie there are unpleasant surprises as well as pleasant ones that was your unpleasant surprise now what would you like for your pleasant surprise
chocolate wobble and pistachio
well coming right up
and peach
all right it going to be wonderful surprise this bowl is lot bigger
the tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying they behave as though nothing had gone wrong they check out sound physically there are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state have no answers jim
there has to be an answer
well can it wait till we get to starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists
we re not leaving here until we find out what went on or what going on
well won prevent you questioning them but it could harm the children if you do
it could be far worse for them if don and for us too
be careful
after this we can all play games
yeah kirk enters
how do you like getting ice cream out of computer
that was fun
well well well you re all having such good time think ll join you is that all right
please do
ll have dish too
oh of course
little one very small one it better than triacus isn it
that dirty old planet
what so good about that place
yeah
you weren there very long you don know
don think your parents liked it very much either
yes they did
yeah mine sure did
parents like stupid things
oh don know about that parents like children
ha that what you think
sure your parents loved you that why they took you with them to triacus so they wouldn be so far away from you for such long time that would make them very unhappy and miss you sure that you would miss them too there silence then
busy busy
busy busy busy busy the running around starts again
guess what we are
know swarm of bees
watch out watch out ll sting you she rushes at kirk and he picks her up
now wait minute
can we have some more ice cream please
no don think so it ll spoil your dinner
see what told you they all say it
yeah
all right children you ve had busy day think you could use some rest nurse chapel will see you to your quarters
very good idea captain
aw do we have to chapel ushers the little ones out
tommy just moment like to ask you question come and sit down tommy will you tell me what you saw
saw where
in the cave on the planet on triacus
you were there
did you see your father today
saw him
did he seem upset
yeah he was very upset
what about
didn ask him
what was going on that would have upset him
how should know he was always upset just like you captain kirk
not upset with you tommy or your friends we invited you aboard the enterprise why would do that if didn like you
you have your reasons
aren you unhappy about leaving triacus
that place that for adults
aren you upset about leaving your parents
my parents they love it down there always busy he nearly chokes up they re happy can go now tired too you know
yes certainly ll take you
know the way tommy leaves
kirk to security post guard on the children they re to be kept under constant watch the children are in circle chanting
hail hail fire and snow call the angel we will go far away for to see friendly angel come to me hail hail fire and snow call the angel we will go far away for to see friendly angel come to me hail hail green figure of large man shimmers into view
echoy voice you have done very well my friends you have done what must be done you have come aboard the enterprise now our destination is federation settlement captain kirk will undoubtedly choose closer station do not let that deter you marcos twelve has millions of people on it nearly million will join us as our friends the rest will be our enemies together with our other friends who will join us we will defeat our enemies as we defeated them on triacus million friends on marcos will make us invincible no one will tell us where to go when to sleep where to eat the universe will be mine to command yours to play in to accomplish this great mission we must first control the enterprise to control the ship we first must control the crew you know how to do that that is your next task and as you believe so shall you do so shall you do as you believe so shall you do so shall you do as you believe so shall you do so shall you do
maintaining standard orbit captain
lieutenant uhura any report from the planet security team
everything is quiet sir
enters captain have extracted the salient portion of professor starnes tapes
good
among the technical facts he gathered professor starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses
let see them triacus ve felt certain growing feeling of uneasiness at first attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with any new project however ve found that the rest of my associates are also bothered by these anxieties the only ones not affected are the children bless them they find the whole thing an exciting adventure ah to be young again
let see some more of these unscientific hypotheses mister spock been experiencing is growing worse
there is another portion captain which believe you ll find particularly interesting today although whatever civilisation that might have been here was destroyed by some natural catastrophe it would appear that one of the race took refuge in the cave tommy enters the bridge and for our efforts we are becoming only more apprehensive tommy clenches his fist as if some unseen force were influencing us the picture on the monitor breaks up and ends
what happened
unknown
didn see you come in tommy
captain after we leave here can you take us to marcos twelve
no we ll probably take you to federation starbase
but have relatives on marcos twelve
sorry tommy marcos twelve is not within our patrol area mister spock we ll pursue this in my quarters
captain can stay here and watch ll be very quiet
all right tommy lieutenant have doctor mccoy report to my quarters for brief conference mister leslie kirk and spock leave
hi there
hi tommy does the fist clenching thing sulu blinks and presses some buttons and turns the navigation dial enterprise leaves orbit mary arrives with her security guard
what is that
blissfully unaware of reality the planet triacus
will we see that all the time we stay here
yes we will all the time we re here
he sees triacus on the screen
he thinks he sees it
seeing reality mister sulu the screen we re out of orbit tommy influences her too the planet is back
will we reach marcos twelve soon
very soon don influences the crew then scott walks in
when did we change course
we haven changed course
what do you mean we haven changed course look at your bridge control monitor
we re still in orbit sir
have you gone completely blind that not orbiting position
don touch the controls sir
what the devil do you think you re doing
we must remain in this orbit till the bridge orders change
you blind fool can you see in front of you we re not in orbit
will not disobey an order from the bridge
you are disobeying an order from the bridge now step aside
you re losing control of yourself
not yet scott throws the engineer aside to get to the controls but the other one present grabs him finally the first man knocks scott out things that do not make sense even went so far as to call starfleet command to request spaceship to be used as transport it was only when couldn tell them what wanted to transport that began to realise that my mind was being directed decided to send dispatch to starfleet warning them god forgive us must destroy ourselves alien upon us the enemy from within the enemy
he never completed the entry and the dispatch was never sent except for scenes of family life games and picnics with the children that is the complete record whatever overwhelmed them must have done so with incredible speed otherwise the professor would have provided details of the experience he was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth
that could be what destroyed him
possible captain evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth
or by misleading the innocent
misleading the innocent wonder
do you mean the children may be involved
yes doctor spock what do we know about the race that lived here
according to the legend triacus was the seat of band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of epsilon indi after many centuries the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon
is that the end of it
no like so many legends this one too has frightening ending it warns that the evil is awaiting catalyst to set it again into motion and send it marauding across the galaxy
is it possible that the evil found the catalyst
was speaking of legend captain
but most legends have their basis in fact spock
think read you jim but as medical officer must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children you are treading dangerously
understand your diagnosis doctor and ll respect it but not to the exclusion and safety of the enterprise thank you mccoy leaves
spock what other expeditions have visited triacus
according to federation records this is the first
what was it professor starnes said about the unseen force
he said an unseen force was influencing him that he recognised it was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for ship
ship yes ship for triacus but why by whom into comm security detachment ready for relief duty on triacus assemble in the transporter room immediately ll have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they re beamed up think it about time we found out whether professor starnes enemy within is on the planet below or here onboard ship with us come on two security men are already on the transporter pads
your tour of duty will last one hour be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings don wait to investigate beam down the guards the two men disappear
beam up the security detachment from triacus no one appears spock what wrong
am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates
why not
it appears we are no longer orbiting triacus
that impossible if we re not orbiting triacus then the men beamed down are dead
captain we are no longer orbiting triacus
activate the bridge monitor screen the starfield appears on the wall monitor
captain to bridge
with all respects captain you re wrong have triacus on my screen now and all five children standing near him
you re off course coming right up the children are doing their chant as kirk and spock rush onto the bridge
hail hail fire and snow call the angel we will go far away far to see friendly angel come to me
sulu
fire and snow call the angel we will go far away far to see friendly angel come to me
friends we have reached moment of crisis the enemy have discovered our operation but they are too late they no longer control the ship we do we shall prevail they will take us any place we desire go back to your stations maintain your controls if resistance mounts call upon their beast their beast will serve us well the fear in each one of them is the beast which will consume him remember how it was on triacus if they resist so shall it be on the enterprise if you need me call and will appear our new goal is marcos twelve it is our new beginning we must not falter the appararition vanishes
go to your stations mary you remain here with me
helmsman disregard what you see on the screen what you think you see on the screen set course for starbase four tommy does the fist thing and sulu sees swords on the viewscreen
helmsman did you hear me
yes sir
lieutenant uhura contact starbase four tell them we re bringing the children there tell starfleet command suspect them of being alien in nature and want thorough investigation made upon our arrival
aye aye sir for some strange reason there is mirror in front of her and tommy changes what she can see in it
lieutenant what are you staring at
see my death long death disease and pain see my death
lieutenant there nothing there
oh god captain don let it be
mister spock you make the call to starfleet mister sulu ordered you to change course mister sulu
captain stay away from the controls if you touch them we ll be destroyed
mister sulu there nothing there
captain why are we bothering starfleet
that was an order spock
this bridge is under complete control
complete
there is no need
take look around you spock tries to reach for his controls but tommy intervenes
cannot obey your order captain vain communications officer who cannot ignore reflection helmsman who thinks he is flying the ship through tunnel of swords kirk goes to the security guard
take mister sulu to his quarters he is relieved of duty but tommy stops the guard and everyone else from hearing what the captain is saying it sounds total gibberish only spock manages to clear his mind
confine them to quarters did you hear me did you hear me tommy summons kirk beast to haunt him loss of confidence and control fear of indecision
captain we must get off this bridge
yes we must losing command losing my ability to command losing the enterprise
losing command losing the enterprise the ship is sailing on and on alone alone alone losing command
captain
ve lost command ve lost the enterprise
jim
ve got command ve got command ve got command
correct captain
where to captain
auxiliary control my vulcan friend this ship is off course
scotty want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot course for starbase four
can do that sir
why not
these are very sensitive instruments will not have you upset their delicate balance we would all be lost forever lost spock sees don go away now go away or we ll kill you
scotty listen to me the enterprise has been invaded by alien beings its destination is marcos if we take it there millions will die the way they died at triacus kirk tries to jump the engineer at the controls but he and spock are forced away they retreat
no all right spock my beast is finished it won return
captain so long as the children are present there is danger they are the carriers
spock they re not the alien beings they re children being misled
they are followers without followers evil cannot spread
they re children
captain the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children
they don understand the evil that they re doing
perhaps that is true but the evil that is within them is spreading fast and unless we can find way to remove it
we ll have to kill them tommy and chekov arrive with two guards captain kirk
what is it ensign
have been instructed to place you and mister spock under arrest
by whose order
starfleet command sir
where did you hear this order ensign now listen to me this order is false want you and your men to return to their stations
sorry but must insist you and mister spock come with me to the detention section
ensign listen to me
drawing his phaser do not force me to kill you sir will if have to will you come peacefully captain
ensign listen to me this is false order ensign
have never disobeyed an order captain you know have never
know that ensign you have never disobeyed an order but an alien being is aboard this ship
will not disobey now cannot disobey
ensign listen to me you will disobey this order starfleet command supersedes your order sir spock and kirk jump them tommy fist is working overtime to try and control the situation but kirk and spock win the fight
enough take these men to detention then join me on the bridge tommy is in the captain chair grinning
the enterprise will never reach marcos twelve we will not be landing there
the crew will take us the crew believes
the crew does not understand when we make them understand as understand they won take you to marcos
they will they will
we are going to marcos we are going to follow our friend
your friend where is your friend where is that stowaway why does he hide
he will come if we call him
but we won we don need him we re not afraid of you
good glad you re not afraid of me takes his seat but your leader is afraid what he afraid of
he not afraid of anybody
he not afraid of anything
he afraid to be seen and when the crew sees and hears him they ll understand that he is not their friend and they won follow him
he is our friend
then let him show himself bring him out let him prove to me that he is my friend and ll follow him to marcos twelve and to the ends of the universe
no spock enters the bridge
mister spock playback the chant the children sang to summon up the gorgan away for to see friendly angel come to me hail hail fire and snow call the angel we will go the other children enter the bridge far away for to see friendly angel come to me
the time has come to see the world as it is come on gorgan appears
who has summoned me
did gorgan my beast is gone it lost its power in the light of reality command again and ordered you here
no captain command here my followers are strong and faithful and obedient that why we take what is ours wherever we go
you take from those who do not know you
and we know you
then you know must win captain
not if we join together to fight you
foolish you will be destroyed would ask you to join me but you are gentle and that is grave weakness
we re also very strong
ah but your strength is cancelled by your gentleness you are full of goodness such as you cannot be changed you are like the parents you must be eliminated
children have pictures of some of you on triacus like to show them to you would you like to see them mister spock the pictures
forbid it
why should you fear it
fear nothing
so we were told mister spock the pictures the children are waiting film of the children playing with their parents appears on spock overhead monitor they smile as they watch themselves having fun then they see their parents lying dead and the smiles are gone
they would not help transport us they were against us they had to be eliminated
tommy father would have destroyed you but he recognised you too late
you are also too late the kind ones always are
not always gorgan not this time you can hide from them they see you as we see you they know what you are even the children learn
you are my future generals together we can raise armies of followers go to your posts the first great victories are upon us you will see we have millions of friends on marcos twelve we shall exterminate all who oppose us our purity of purpose cannot be contaminated by those who disagree who will not co-operate who do not understand they must be annihilated but now the children are crying
don be afraid look at him without you children he nothing the evil remains within him gorgan becomes ugly
command you command you to your posts carry out your duties or will destroy you you will be swept aside to make way for the strong
look how ugly he really is look at him and don be afraid
death death to you all death to you all death to you all death to you all gorgon fades away sulu swords vanish mccoy enters
it all right
they re crying jim don know how it happened but it good to see
it all right mary it all right it all right isn it doctor
yes it all right we can help them now
marcos twelve dead ahead sir
reverse course mister sulu
aye sir mccoy leads the children off the bridge
course reversed captain
set course for starbase four mister sulu
yes sir
on mark eight and closing
steady as she goes phaser crew stand by there strange object on the viewscreen
range forty five thousand kilometres captain
fascinating
range forty three thousand kilometres and closing
sensor readings
mechanical device of unknown properties read no life forms aboard
analysis science officer
obviously it intends to intercept us it has made several course changes corresponding with our own
thirty eight thousand and closing thirty five thousand and closing
unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us
thank you science officer come to one eight one mark seven
aye aye sir the object swings back into the centre of the viewscreen
it staying with us
indeed
full stop mister chekov hold your position
aye sir you will turn back immediately this is the only warning you will receive
vulcan captain
english
it was russian sir every word
no captain it was swahili
interesting telepathy
unquestionably most impressive
our orders are very clear we re to establish contact with the melkotians at all costs
true telepaths can be most formidable and we have been warned
what previous contacts have been made with the melkotians
no recorded contacts if they ever ventured into space they evidently withdrew immediately
lieutenant hailing frequencies
tied in sir
this is captain james kirk of the starship enterprise representing the united federation of planets we ve contacted your buoy and understand its message we hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you lieutenant answer
nothing sir clear on all frequencies
try again
still no response sir
opinion mister spock
prefer being welcomed guest captain but there seems to be little choice
none whatsoever mister chekov deflectors at full intensity increase speed to achieve planet fall as scheduled
aye sir standard orbit in five minutes the buoy does not obstruct them
lieutenant uhura advise doctor mccoy and engineer scott to meet me in the transporter room mister spock mister chekov let go find out what it is they re afraid of captain log stardate 4385 we have transported down to the melkotian planet and have encountered conditions which are completely contrary to what we were prepared for the landing party are surrounded by dense fog
spock what is this
unknown captain sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area
knew it had to happen it fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down
impossible doctor mccoy my transporter was working perfectly
then what are we doing here
tricorder readings mister spock
unknown captain unlike mister scott transporter this unit is not functioning
then let get out of here kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise come in
no use captain obviously none of our devices will function apparently that melkotian buoy
pair of red eyes in the fog aliens our warning was plain you have disregarded it you shall be punished you captain kirk the disobedience was on your orders yours is the responsibility yours shall be the pattern of your death
we come in peace but we ll defend ourselves if necessary
you are outside you are disease the disease must be destroyed your plea has been heard and sentence has been pronounced it is done and suddenly they are standing in wild west street with six-shooters and holsters instead of phasers
fascinating
where are we now captain the sheriff office is just the front of the building no sides back or roof
spock evaluation
obviously this represents the melkotian concept of an american frontier town circa 1880
it just bits and pieces it incomplete
perhaps the melkotians have insufficient data about this era
or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death
and these captain the guns
beautiful specimen
crude but dangerous
whatever the melkotians have planned for us it won be pleasant these could be useful just remember one thing to individuals at close range these could be as deadly as phasers
in the midst of what seems so unreal the harsh reality this is not dream
reading from newspaper pinned up october 26 1881 tombstone arizona
tombstone hell for leather right out of history
but why here and why now
captain the melkot said you were the pattern he looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment
because my ancestors pioneered the american frontier
yes the violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution
what the matter with us we re talking like we really are in tombstone arizona in 1881
precisely in terms of what the melkots intend for us
there something about that date october 26 1881 but what was it the sheriff comes over grinning
ike ike frank billy tom shakes kirk hand ike was afraid you weren going to make it
looks like we did
knew you wouldn let them scare you away they re bunch of hot air if you ask me
are they really
now they re going to have to fight after the way they shot off their mouths
you know us
funny that what like about you lke you always see the funny side
barrel of laughs
nobody can say johnny behan doesn have sense of humour walks on
johnny he called me lke you frank bones tom and billy ike clanton tom and frank mclowery billy claiborne billy clanton
captain pride myself on my knowledge of your earth history the names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of america the united states of america that is
in the late nineteenth century in arizona two factions fought for control of the town of tombstone the earps morgan virgil and wyatt who were the town marshals along with doc holliday
and the clanton gang on october 26th they had it out
who won
the clantons lost mister chekov
and we are the clantons
we are the clantons and if this is replay of history
history cannot be changed there brawl in the saloon and window is broken man in black wearing badge shoots another man the group run over
it impossible things like this can happen
is this dead man doctor
very dead mister spock
that one thing we can be sure of death is real tables chairs bar pianola no roof or walls
ike frank hiya boys didn think see you again
billy oh billy kisses chekov billy baby knew they couldn keep you out of town
oh you knew that
come on she takes him to table while the man in black walks slowly past the group
maybe you shouldn have
and pass up an opportunity to see you don be silly
it taking crazy chances with morgan earp right in the same room the man in black
yes of course the man who kills on sight morgan earp
captain since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately without moving muscle of either hand if remember correctly that would involve you in what was called the fast draw it initiated unfortunate events everyone sits slowly
you boys want your usual
absolutely half gallon of scotch
you know we ain got nothing but bourbon unless you want corn whiskey
wish it was all over saw virgil out patrolling this morning
good old virgil we can always count on him
they ve been blowing off all over town about how they chased the clantons out guess you ll show them now won you morgan walks over to sylvia who is massaging chekov shoulders
don think we re going to have any choice
you ll dirty yourself with this scum come on
get your hands off her

no no no all right all right all right we don want any trouble
if you don want any trouble what are you doing in my town
just leave us alone mister earp that all we ask
five of you you like me to draw wouldn you all right will soon enough soon enough morgan earp leaves
believe he was actually trying to provoke dispute with mister chekov
bringing bottle and glasses close ike lucky there wasn two of them
guess so
sylvia right they ve been bad-mouthing something fierce all over town you boys watch it
assure you sir we shall watch it and everything extremely closely
billy you were wonderful she kisses him
er mister chekov
what can do captain you know we re always supposed to maintain good relations with the natives he kisses her
young lady young lady
yes ike
like to talk to mister to billy alone if you don mind
all right understand billy claiborne you be careful sylvia leaves them
mister chekov you be careful mister spock except for our hand guns we haven changed not even our clothing yet these people see and hear us as the clantons
don think that such bad thing captain
the day is still young ensign
all right what have we got we re here in tombstone arizona october 26 1881 the day of the gunfight at ok corral and we re the clantons and morgan earp has just gone to tell his brothers we re here
and if this is indeed some sort of replay of history the earps will kill the clantons at the ok corral at five clock this afternoon
well we re not going to be at the ok corral at five clock this afternoon you bartender ed you er you claim you know us
ain making no big claims about you to nobody just so happens
take close look at me
yeah
who do you think am
ike clanton who do you think you are
know this is hard to understand but captain james kirk of the spaceship enterprise these men are part of my crew we re not really here we re from the future we haven been born yet feel the material in my shirt now feel the material in your own shirt do you notice any difference
no
do these clothes look like yours
not exactly
have you seen clothes like this before
sure
where
on the clantons you clantons are always great with your jokes that why we like you
not joking
the only difference between you and the earps is that they never joke
not joking not ike clanton
it okay with me ike anything you say don make no difference who think you are your problem is who does wyatt earp think you are the marshall is wyatt earp and morgan is also there when kirk walks in
good morning gentlemen my name james kirk afraid there been some sort of misunderstanding
clanton don know what you re trying to pull but we warned you not to show your ugly face in town again
yes of course you did and wanted to talk to you about that
we re done talking clanton
there been some sort of mistake misunderstanding
all right clanton one more chance your last you ve got until five tonight to get your horse-stealing scurvy crew out of town all the way
yes we be glad to we don want to fight
always said you was yellow clanton
ll make one more attempt to get through to you mister earp my name is not clanton it kirk
oh yeah we heard the talk about your jokes
not joking
sure well glad to meet you mister kirk morgan punches kirk and they fight briefly kirk gets morgan in front of him as shield from wyatt gun then lets him go
draw clanton
not me mister earp
you draw or will
no wyatt let me when the time comes ll pay him for this
we don want any trouble we ll be glad to co-operate
five clock clanton is that clear if you re in town at five oh one we ll kill every one of you whether you draw or not is that clear mccoy is tending to kirk lip he flinches from whatever mccoy has put on the cloth
what the matter
what do you call that stuff fire
taos lightning straight bourbon try some in small amounts it was considered medicinal
label it for external use only
it just takes bit of getting used to captain actually man could grow quite fond of this stuff
take it easy mister scott hate to think what that stuff doing to your stomach lining
and your reflexes we re going to need fast reflexes from now on there no negotiating with the earps we know that
aye if we only had phaser
or communicator it be pleasure to watch those earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty
could we make communicator
impossible captain in this century there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours
the problem is clear spock we re going to have to seek contemporary solutions where chekov
mister chekov is involved captain
you shouldn have come back to town billy morgan ll kill you because he wants me
with his outdated weapon if he shoots at me will just step out of the way
you can joke about it ve seen them in action especially morgan
lot of people and things have tried to kill me you be surprised
mister chekov mean billy come along
yes sir
billy please don even go near him
gentlemen
where are we going captain
to exercise the better part of valour but when they get to the city limits notice they are stopped with sizzle
well that settles that force field then clock face in mid-air strikes three
it is obvious the melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town
if we could only contact the enterprise
yes but where is the enterprise
mister chekov if you were in charge of the enterprise what would you be doing
be using the ship sensors trying to locate us
very good if we could find the place where we beamed down the ship might lock in and beam us up
well let get there
there no way we can know where it is doctor
it could be anywhere within thousand mile radius
mister spock why don you join us common humanoids in trying to find way out of here and quit explaining why we can get out of here
we have until five clock to find that way now consider this what materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the earps on their own terms
showing his gun we have these captain
no the melkots gave us those to execute us we have to find way to put the earps out of action is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap
all those western cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus plants
bones the venom the plants can you make use of them
tranquilliser of course jim can make tranquilliser
could make device to deliver it on target
first bones the ingredients you require
know the place to get the proper drugs ll need mortar and pestle
chekov mortar and pestle mccoy and chekov leave
how do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target
shall need some fusing and cotton wadding
cotton wadding try the apothecary
aye leaves
shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister more familiarly known as gas grenade the sign on the wall says teeth pulling by appointment there man in the chair having shave
ll be about five minutes yet you could come back
well thank you mind if look around bit checking the bottles crude but very useable
wouldn touch that stuff if was you
oh you don have to worry know how to handle this have an urgent need for small supply of this drug too
that stuff ain mine it belongs to him you better ask him
oh so you re the dentist well physician and have serious emergency wonder if you mind if borrow small quantity of this
you want it now
my name is mccoy doctor
that joke is all around town already mclowery but my name is still holliday doc holliday
the emergency is real need these things
your emergency sure is real go on take the stuff have some more fun take my bag only best you be finished before five clock
that is my intention doctor
because at one minute past five you ll find hole in your head right from this gun sawn-off shotgun mccoy leaves with the bag and bottles
ahem
sylvia hello
billy claiborne you know how crazy am about you
that very nice
well aren you going to ask me what ve got in my shopping bag
that just what was preparing to inquire have you been shopping
of course silly what else would be doing on beautiful afternoon with the dance only one week away or have you forgotten that already
no no haven forgotten am looking forward to it most eagerly
you will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown going to make found this most scrumptious material yards and yards of it you know what was thinking billy was thinking what beautiful wedding gown it would make why don we just turn that dance into wedding ball it would be so heavenly
married afraid that wouldn be possible
but positive the gown will be ready what else is there to stop wedding
but it is absolutely impossible am not someone you can marry if only could make clear to you what really am
do you think don know billy claiborne you are cattle rustler and horse thief and don care what else
warned you claiborne stay away morgan punches chekov knocking him down
you don have to take anything from that scum not while here
mister earp get your hands off her chekov walks towards morgan and gets shot kirk and spock hear sylvia scream and arrive on the scene the same time as mccoy followed by scott wyatt and holliday also turn up
there nothing can do jim
come on clanton let do it now
captain let me
no
yeah come on captain let him
captain we can just stand here and take it
yes we can
but they murdered chekov if you think going to
scotty they re trying to push us into something we re not ready for
and it is not yet our time spock is working on the grenade mccoy and scott on the tranquilliser
let it go jim he dead
maybe he wouldn be if hadn ignored the melkot warning
we all knew the risk when we joined the service now let it go
gentlemen there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us specifically our future
but not this minute spock it takes us little longer
understand the feeling captain
you talk about another man feelings what do you feel spock
my feelings are not subject for discussion doctor
because there are no feelings to discuss
mister spock chekov is dead say it now and can hardly believe it but you worked closely with him that deserves some memorial
spock will have no truck with grief scotty it human
bones scotty
captain it quite all right they forget am half human the clock strikes four
we don have much time
captain vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage but am confused
about what
since each of us represents members of the clanton gang you ike clanton frank mclowery then mister chekov would be the other billy would he not
william claiborne that right
but did not william claiborne survive the battle at the ok corral
get to the point spock
mister chekov is dead but in the actual gunfight william claiborne survived
yes yes that right that means it doesn have to happen the way it happened we can change it bones how the tranquilliser coming
ll have it ready before spock
spock
another hour
and we ll have tranquilliser grenade
not precisely
forget precision will it work
it should
make sure it does spock if we don tranquillise them we ll have to fight them
and if we fight them we all die we know that
negotiating with them could buy us more time captain
but not with the earps ve tried that that out there must be way history has been changed in the fact that billy claiborne didn die but chekov is lying there dead that means there must be way to change this history
it would be worth try at least until we re certain of the device then perhaps we could quiet things down
not with the earps there is one other place can try
you looking for somebody
yes sheriff want you to stop the fight
stop it who wants to stop it sure don you don you didn yesterday
do now
since when does clanton run crawling to the law for help
how else is he going to get justice
indicating gun from this you and your boys set up this whole thing to take care of the earps it little late to decide you don have the belly for it
it not too late sheriff sheriff there must be plenty of decent people in town who don like the earps let organise them
don talk nonsense the people in this town are counting on you to get rid of the earps for them
then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them
you can talk that way after what the earps did to billy today nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge
yes want revenge want to crush the life out of the earps but can just kill them
you listen to me get down to the ok corral keep out of sight when the earps come looking you bushwhack them
can get it through your stupid head can just kill them can murder them
it the only way
can kill them can kill them
kill them any way you can there ll be no questions asked honest guarantee that
these crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well
doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this
perhaps they would ve been if they had your ingenuity doctor kirk enters
captain
how soon will that be ready
right now
good how long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect
three or four seconds
how did you manage to test it
it has not been tested
it not necessary captain it very simple nothing can go wrong
up to now everything has gone wrong want it tested now
would volunteer solve the problem
it would
all right on one condition that wide awake and with you at five clock
guaranteed
aye has slug of whiskey it to kill the pain
but this is painless
well you should ve warned me sooner mister spock fire away spock pulls the thread on the can and gas comes out scott stands close to it then he picks it up so the gas obscures his face
it should have worked did you inhale the gas scotty
aye deeply
you still feel all right
never felt better
no dizziness no sweating no palpitations
it doesn work
fascinating
it was our last chance
captain you don seem to understand it did not function but it must function
nothing could go wrong captain it should work
scientific fact but if the tranquilliser does not function which is clearly impossible then radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order
we need weapon an answer
you don have to worry about that now jim look at the clock
ten minutes and it all going to end at the ok corral well we re going to wait right here until well after five clock we re not going to move from this spot famous last words captain
let get out of here but there is forcefield to stop them
scotty bones and it all the way around we re trapped they got their way we ve got to stand and fight
good if they want fight let gie em fight
they re experts at gunfighting we don have chance
then we better become experts and fast
that may not be necessary
spock you ve got something
fact captain physical laws simply cannot be ignored existence cannot be without them
what do you mean spock
mean doctor that we are faced with staggering contradiction the tranquilliser you created should have been effective
it would ve been effective anywhere else
exactly doctor in your opinion what killed mister chekov
piece of lead in his body
wrong his mind killed him
come on spock if you ve got the answer tell us
physical reality is consistent with universal laws where the laws do not operate there is no reality all of this is unreal
what do you mean unreal examined chekov he dead
but you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust we judge reality by the response of our senses once we are convinced of the reality of given situation we abide by its rules we judged the bullets to be solid the guns to be real therefore they can kill
chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him
he may indeed be dead we do not know
but we do know that the melkotians created the situation if we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real they cannot kill us
exactly know the bullets are unreal therefore they cannot harm me
we must all be as certain as you are mister spock to save our lives
precisely
but that not possible there always be some doubt
the smallest doubt would be enough to kill you
we re just human beings spock we don have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do we can turn it on and off
we must spock vulcan mind meld
very well sir engineer the clock strikes five wyatt earp puts on his gun belt
your mind to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts the marshalls gather as the lightning flashes and the wind blows
to mccoy the bullets are unreal without body they are illusions only shadows without substance they will not pass through your body for they do not exist
they do not exist holliday joins the earps spock to kirk unreal appearances only they are shadows illusions nothing but ghosts of reality they are lies falsehoods spectres without body they are to be ignored the melds have been completed when the four killers arrive at the corral
captain
draw kirk reaches for his gun and the earps fire we see the bullets splintering the wood behind the landing party the earps empty their guns then kirk engages wyatt in good old-fashioned fisticuffs he beats him but chooses not to shoot him everything disappears mccoy is examining chekov at his station
captain don understand
neither do he in perfect health
what happened where have been
right here it seems
but that girl she was so beautiful so real
do you remember anything else
no
good perhaps that explains why he here nothing was real to him except the girl
captain the melkotian object
sensor readings
the object is beginning to emit m-rays of highly unstable nature captain
lieutenant sound red alert mister chekov deflector shields on full phaser gun crews lock on target
energy output increasing beyond measurable levels captain
phaser guns stand by to fire the melkotian buoy explodes
it it gone sir
damage report lieutenant
no damage sir all decks report fully operational of your kind
it is we fight only when there no choice we prefer the ways of peaceful contact speak for vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing we have sought you out to join us our mission is still one of peace delegation will come out to meet you our warning threats are over
excellent lieutenant cancel red alert mister chekov resume original course warp factor two
warp factor two sir
captain may ask question you needn answer if it seems too personal
sure ll be able to give you an answer mister spock
this afternoon you wanted to kill didn you
but he didn kill mister spock
but he wanted to doctor
is that the way it seemed to you mister spock
yes captain
mister spock you re absolutely right that exactly the way it was
mankind ready to kill
that the way it was in 1881
wonder how humanity managed to survive
we overcame our instinct for violence kirk mccoy chekov and security guard have beamed down to planet with green sky and occasional outcrops of vertical rocks their phasers are drawn
report mister chekov
full scan results negative radiation level normal atmosphere and terrain are undisturbed no evidence of colony nor any residual aftereffect of force that might have annihilated it
life readings doctor mccoy
nothing they said they were being attacked by an unidentified ship
which we were unable to detect upon approach
an entire human colony whole settlement one hundred men women and children who did it and why communicator beep kirk here
sensors have picked up klingon ship closing fast
total reply if attacked so that the answer klingons
trouble aboard the klingon ship evidence of explosions massive destruction five furious klingons beam down
and we never fired upon her
maintain red alert the klingons arrive and their leader hits kirk with his disruptor knocking him down
you attacked my ship four hundred of my crew dead kirk my ship is disabled claim yours you are now prisoners of the klingon empire against which you have committed wanton act of war and weird swirl of light hangs in the air little way away the federation landing party are disarmed
for three years the federation and the klingon empire have been at peace treaty we have honoured to the letter
we took no action against your ship kang
were the screams of my crew imaginary what were your orders kirk to start war you ve succeeded to test new weapon we shall be happy to examine it
there was federation colony on this planet it was destroyed
by what no bodies no ruins colony of the invisible
yes test of new klingon weapon leaving no traces federation ships don specialise in sneak attacks
we have wondered when you would begin you lured my ship into ambush by false klingon distress call you will tell us why with the proper persuasion
you received distress call we received distress call
don propose to spend the rest of my life on this ball of dust arguing your fantasies the enterprise is mine instruct your transporter room to beam us aboard
go to the devil
we have no devil kirk but we understand the habits of yours shall torture you to death one by one until your noble captain cries enough who will be first
cossacks filthy klingon murderers you killed my brother piotre the archanis four research outpost hundred peaceful people massacred just like you did here my brother you killed my brother
and you volunteer to join him that is loyalty klingon places an agoniser on chekov face and he screams kirk is held back
chekov stop the torture
jim you can hand over the enterprise
help chekov
don plan any tricks kirk will kill one hundred hostages at the first sign of treachery
ll beam you aboard the enterprise once there no tricks kang gives him communicator
captain you can don let these animals have the ship
move aside he tends to chekov
animals your captain crawls like one klingon would never have surrendered order everybody in this area to be transported up all weapons on him
kirk to enterprise mister spock
mister spock we have guests adjust transporter to wide field beam up everyone in the target area and presses button an amber light flashes by the captain chair
understood captain transporter room the group is beamed up and the weird light follows just the four federation people materialise on the pads
full security johnson on the double the security guard runs off spock enters
good work spock
what happened
our landing party is intact doctor
all others suspended in transit who are the guests by the way
klingons
well they re right in here
johnson
security on the way sir
captain leave them where they are non-existence that so many less klingon monsters in the galaxy two more security guards arrive
bring them in the klingons materialise and are quickly disarmed
move em out move
liar
said no tricks after we reach the ship you re prisoner of the federation of planets against which you may or may not have committed an act of war
there are still survivors aboard my ship
captain we ve not been able to get through to starfleet command all subspace frequencies have been blocked and there too much radiation coming from that klingon ship it hazard to the vicinity
prepare to destruct
completing the job you started
you wouldn be standing here if had
first group from the klingon vessel captain six klingons including two women materialise they are hustled away except one
my wife mara and my science officer
kang what has happened
more federation treachery we are prisoners
what will they do to us ve heard of their atrocities their death camps they will torture us for our scientific and military information
apparently you have few things to learn about us detain them in the crew lounge programme the food synthesiser to accommodate our guests you ll be well-treated kang
so have seen kang and mara are led away
secure from red alert the weird light hides as kirk and spock leave the transporter room
but maintain general quarters scan this sector for other ships run full check on the colony want this thing nailed down fast
we know what happened that distress call
at the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on beta twelve the klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers moreover they also were apparently attracted by distress call
lies they want to start war by pretending that we did
chekov may be right the klingons claim to have honoured the truce but there have been incidents raids on our outposts
no proof that klingons committed it
what proof do we need we know what klingon is leaves the turbolift
our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present situation
unfortunately there no guarantee that they will be believed
report
still no contact with starfleet command sir outside communications blanketed
keep trying we ve got diplomatic tiger by the tail
very good scotty mister sulu
forward phasers locked and ready to fire sir
fire phasers the klingon ship is vapourised
sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range captain
lieutenant uhura
no contact with starfleet as yet sir
mister sulu change course to seventeen mark four warp factor three
warp factor three sir
when take this ship ll have kirk head stuffed and hung on his cabin wall
they will kill us before we can act
no they wish to question us learn our strength our plans they never will
we are forty against four hundred
four thousand throats may be cut in one night by running man
patience vigilance they will make mistake capture of the enterprise will give us knowledge to end this war quickly the weird light from the planet is up near the ceiling
losing her temper captain this doesn make sense carriers are normal channels are open there still no outside contact don understand it sir could the klingons be doing something then the ship shudders as if from an explosion and changes course
sulu
change in course accelerating helm dead auxiliary navigation dead
override
nothing responds captain
scotty stop all engines
the controls have gone crazy something taken over
scotty
they ve gone to warp nine by themselves
new course
nine oh two mark five
that ll take us out of the galaxy
captain reports coming in from the lower decks emergency bulkheads have closed almost four hundred crewmen are trapped down there sir
most interesting the bulk of your crew trapped your ship racing from this galaxy at wild speeds delightful how did perform this sabotage kirk all my men are here
johnson get down to security search every section some klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship then get down to engineering and help scotty hammer things back to normal and free those trapped crewmen to kang and before put you in the brig there little something owe you he punches kang solitaire set on table changes into short sword which kang picks up potted plant and 3d chess set become swords
phasers but they turn into swords too there stunned pause then brief fight as the starfleet group get out of the room
out
stand and fight you cowards another brief skirmish and johnson gets stabbed they make it into the turbolift
sickbay the security men carry their comrade out
bridge
the klingons are free they re armed as we are they ll try to take the ship scotty how many men do we have
deploy forces to protect your section and the auxiliary control centre those trapped crewmen
the doors and bulkheads won budge we ll have to cut through
blow out the bulkheads if you have to we need numbers what kind of luck have you had controlling the ship speed
no sir she projectile at warp nine and don ask me what holding her together
full sensor scan of the ship report on any movement by the klingons the klingon empire has maintained duelling tradition they think they can beat us with swords
captain neither the klingon technology nor ours is capable of this the instantaneous transmutation of matter doubt that they are responsible
any other logical candidate
none however if they had such power would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves
mister sulu get below take command of engineering and auxiliary control
aye sir sulu leaves
captain he has sword too
mister chekov
captain gets up to go with sulu
mister chekov as you were chekov
sir let me go too ve got personal score to settle with the klingons
this is no time for vendetta maintain your post
captain
chekov maintain your post
don try to stop me captain saw what they left of piotre and swore on his grave would avenge his murder chekov dashes into the turbolift
what chekov grudge against the klingons who piotre
his only brother killed in klingon raid
his brother he never had brother he an only child
sulu get down to engineering
aye sir sulu leaves
security this is the captain find mister chekov and bring him to the bridge
captain why would why would chekov believe he has brother
don know but he does and now he wants revenge for non-existent loss mccoy finishes bandaging johnson
there those filthy butchers there are rules even in war you don keep hacking at man after he down hand me that numanol capsule there man with head wound in another bed and security guard is brought in too the klingons access ship schematics on desk monitor
layout and specifications of the enterprise commander
enemy numbers are the same as ours we have fighting balance
then we take the ship
ship that is headed towards the end of the galaxy
in time in time we must take these sections first engineering
scott here sir there no use trying to free those men down below the phaser torches they won cut through the bulkheads nor the doors nor the decks there something happened to the metal
there now sir and you never saw such fine collection of antiques in your life we pull back to see racks of swords billhooks pikes
get back to engineering try to re-establish engine control and talk to ordnance about manufacturing phaser replacements
aye sir spots special sword amongst the ordinary ones claymore you re beauty
what the blazes is going on
scans indicate that our forces and those of the klingons are exactly equal at thirty eight each the klingons control deck six and starboard deck seven while we control all sections above
constant surveillance mister spock
most curious captain there appear to be more life-energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the enterprise crew plus the klingons considerable discrepancy
could more klingons have beamed aboard
shall attempt compensatory reading of klingon units inside engineering the weird light seems to be bigger scott climbs up an access ladder to the corridor
any signs of those devils mister sulu
all clear mister scott scott is talking to some engineers when they are jumped by klingons he backs out into the corridor where sulu karate chops scott attacker
they ve taken engineering don know how many more of those klingons are around but we ll split up here and try to make it back to the bridge
aye kang and mara come in to receive the praise of their crew
victory victory
no additional klingons detected captain it is an alien life force single entity cannot ascertain its location
an alien life force we must make contact find out what it wants
readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis computer report
alien life force onboard is composed of pure energy type unknown actions indicate intelligence and purpose
what purpose
insufficient data for further analysis
brother that never existed phantom colony imaginary distress calls the creation of these weapons do you sense pattern mister spock
if the alien is creating these events captain it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind
and now it has control of the enterprise and taking us out of the galaxy but why
captain am constrained to point out that since minds are evidently being influenced we cannot know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true
we must talk to kang bury the hatchet
an appropriate choice of terms however it is notoriously difficult to arrange truce with the klingons once blood has been drawn
truce are you serious ve got men in sickbay some of them dying atrocities committed on their persons and you talk about making peace with these fiends if our backs were turned they jump us in minute and you know what klingons do to prisoners slave labour death planets experiments
mccoy
while you re talking they re planning attacks this is fight to the death we better start trying to win it
we are attempting to end it doctor by reason preferably there is an alien on board which may have created this situation
who cares what started it mister spock we re in it murderers we should wipe out every one of them
the alien is the real threat that the enemy we have to wipe out
sickbay calling doctor there are more wounded men requiring your attention
how many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools leaves the intercom whistles
this is kang
kang there something important must discuss with you ship power and life-support systems own you will die of suffocation in the icy cold of space the power has gone off
dictating into padd the enterprise is heading out of our galaxy controlled by mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship engineering has been taken over by klingons who have cut off life-support systems mister sulu
captain
get down to emergency manual control try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power
aye captain sulu leaves as scott arrives
sir chekov was right captain
scotty glad you ve come
we should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter that right where they belong
scotty
non-existence now they can study the enterprise add our technology to theirs change the balance of power you ve jeopardised the federation
scotty take it easy
easy mister scott
keep your vulcan hands off me just keep away your feelings might be hurt you green-blooded half-breed
may say that have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans find their illogic and foolish emotions constant irritant
then transfer out freak
gentlemen intervenes as they nearly come to blows spock scotty spock spock stop it you re half human what are we saying what are we doing to each other
fascinating the result of stress
we ve been under stress before it never set us at each other throats
but this is war
there isn any war or is there
have we forgotten how to defend ourselves
scotty what happening to us we ve been trained to think in other terms than war we ve been trained to fight its causes if necessary then why are we behaving like group of savages look at me look at me two forces aboard this ship each of them equally armed has war been staged for us complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating even spock even race hatred
recent events would seem to be directed toward magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and klingons apparently it is by design that we fight we seem to be pawns
but what the game and whose and what are the rules
it is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately and determine its motives and method for halting its activities
without sensors all our power down this thing could go anywhere
yes mister sulu report
circuits are in but systems just aren responding then the lights come back on
we re getting something
aye captain power and life-support restored remotes on standby
but captain didn do it everything just came on by itself
their life-support systems have resumed
sensors may be operating
start scanning let find that alien
holding steady
cause them to be unsteady
they appear to be controlled from another location also unable to affect ship course for return to our empire
one of kirk tricks could he bypass this circuit what power is it that supports our battle yet starves our victory power interrupt it at their main life-support couplings where
number six deck to klingon come
alien detected in the engineering section near reactor number three
let go kirk and spock armed with swords leave the bridge the weird light hides as chekov comes along he hides then kills the klingon and takes mara prisoner
you don die yet you re not human but you re very beautiful very beautiful he rips her top covers her mouth and ll leave his intentions to your imaginations kirk comes along in the nick of time
chekov he hauls him off mara and slaps him twice knocking him out
jim he not responsible
what have done to mara there an alien entity aboard the ship it forcing us to fight we don want to we don know what its motive is we re trying to find out you must help us take me to kang temporary truce that all ask spock take her spock and mara leave
chekov chekov picks him up is this what in store for us from here on in violence hatred it very busy kirk carries in chekov followed by spock and mara
brain waves show almost paranoid mania what happened
he lost control so did we re becoming animal warriors let go spock
orderly jim johnson heart wound is almost healed same with the other casualties sword wounds in the vital organs massive trauma shock they re all healing at fantastic rate
it would appear that the entity wants us alive
why so we can fight and fight and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum what next the roar of crowds
perhaps human and klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers
gentlemen if we are pawns you re looking at one who is extremely sorry
understand doctor too felt brief surge of racial bigotry most distasteful
let find the alien to mara you come with us maybe we can prove to you that it exists the weird light is up ahead of them and glowing red
what is it
totally unfamiliar
what do you want what are you doing here
reporting for duty sir
duty did mccoy release you from sickbay
released myself
then get back to sickbay
not on your life sir fit and ready for action the klingons almost did me in once out to even the score
order you
ve got my orders obeying orders kill the klingons it them or us isn it
johnson they cross swords but spock neck-pinches johnson the light becomes yellow
fascinating during lieutenant johnson emotional outburst his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance the alien life energy level increased when the lieutenant became unconscious the alien lost energy
it subsists on the emotions of others
this one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility violent intentions
it exists on the hate of others
to put it simply and it has acted as catalyst creating this situation in order to satisfy that need it has brought together opposing forces provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict
and kept numbers and resources balanced so that it can maintain constant state of violence it got to have vulnerable area we ve got to get rid of it
then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated the fighting must end and soon
or we re doomed ship travelling forever between galaxies filled with eternal bloodlust eternal warfare kang has got to listen we ve got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing goes to intercom kang kang this is captain kirk
commander it trick
kang switches off intercom he won answer
the alien is affecting his mind captain soon it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it
the ship dilithium crystals are deteriorating we can stop the process
time factor
well do whatever you can kirk out the weird light floats off through bulkhead
and so we drift in space with only hatred and bloodshed aboard now do you believe captain log stardate armageddon we must find way to defeat the alien force of hate that has taken over the enterprise stop the war now or spend eternity in futile bloody violence
there no change captain the dilithium crystals are discharging
there nothing we can do about it
if could talk to kang somehow cut through the klingon lines make peace before it too late
we have nine minutes fifty three seconds to power zero spock: there is of course logical alternative kang wife is after all our prisoner perhaps threat
aye now that something the klingons would understand
kang kang this is captain kirk off we have mara your wife we talk truce now or she dies reply
she has five seconds to live reply
she is victim of war captain
he called my bluff
you re not going
the federation doesn kill or mistreat its prisoners you ve been listening to propaganda fables how much time
eight minutes forty two seconds
so this was no trick
it the alien that done this we re in its power our people and yours
we only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all
we have always fought we must we are hunters captain tracking and taking what we need there are poor planets in the klingon systems we must push outward if we are to survive
there another way to survive mutual trust and help
will help you now
how
will take you to kang will add my voice to yours
wouldn trust her captain
we can get through the klingon defences in time unless spock intra-ship beaming from one section to another it possible
it has rarely been done because of the danger involved pinpoint accuracy is required if the transportee should materialise inside solid object deck or wall
even if it could work she may be leading you into trap
we re all in trap this is the only way out
we ll go with you
no that start the final battle believe her prepare the transporter we ll wait for your signal kirk and mara leave
but she can guarantee that kang will stop to listen right mister spock
no one can guarantee the actions of another captain
when transporter is energised you will have eight seconds to get to the pads
hope your computations are correct mister spock they dash to the pads then kirk returns to the console to leave his cutlass behind kirk and mara beam in
mara you re alive and you bring us prize
kang wait he come alone unarmed he must talk to you
brave captain what about
no listen to him we are all in danger the weird light is glowing blood red
mara before you start killing give me one minute kang swings his sword at kirk head and mara intervenes
kang don
what have they done to you mara are you out of your mind what have they done to you sees the torn tunic see why the human beast did not kill you
they didn harm me listen to him kang pushes her aside so she throws kirk sword the two leaders have an old-fashioned sword fight stop stop please
with your death we win
nobody wins have any more of your men died we can be killed there an alien aboard it wants us alive
no doubt you will reassemble after have hacked you to bits
you fool contingent of federation including mccoy and spock take on the rest of the klingons in the corridor spock cheats with his neck-pinch finally kirk gets the point of his sword at kang throat
look look kang for the rest of our lives thousand lifetimes senseless violence fighting while an alien has total control over us kirk throws away his sword
all right all right in the heart in the head won stay dead next time ll do the same to you ll kill you and it goes on the good old game of war pawn against pawn stopping the bad guys while somewhere something sits back and laughs and starts it all over again
let jump him
those who hate and fight must stop themselves doctor otherwise it is not stopped
kang am your wife klingon would lie for them listen to kirk he is telling the truth
be pawn be toy be good soldier that never questions orders kang looks at the weird light then throws down his sword
klingons kill for their own purposes
all fighting must end captain to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone
lieutenant uhura
put me on ship-wide intercom
kang
this is captain kirk truce is ordered the fighting is over lay down your weapons
this is kang cease hostilities disarm the fighting stops the weird light turns orange
the cessation of violence appears to have weakened it captain suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon
get off my ship you re dead duck here you re powerless we know about you and we don want to play maybe there are others like you around maybe you ve caused lot of suffering lot of history but that all over we ll be on guard now ready for you so ship out come on haul it
yeah out already
out we need no urging to hate humans but for the present only fool fights in burning house out to the sound of laughter the weird light turns to white and leaves the enterprise enterprise medical log stardate 5027 doctor leonard mccoy recording concerned about captain kirk he shows indications of increasing tension and emotional stress
have completed the assignment captain theoretical incursion into
yes mister chekov can read and as usual your theoretical evaluations do not tally with mine return to your duty and ll let you know when your work is satisfactory
mister spock full sensor scan of the region please
did give full report
yes mister spock that was the past concerned with the present or is it becoming too much for this crew to present me current information spock; no sir compliance presents no problem
then mister spock comply
sensor scan to one half parsec negative captain
very well possibly that we ve been on patrol too long without relief and diversion he has resisted all of my attempts to run psychological profile on him
maintaining course and speed sir
change course come about to one eight five mark three
but sir that ll lead us directly into the romulan neutral zone
yes very perceptive mister sulu know where the course change takes us execute
aye sir
increasing sensor scan to one parsec all scanners report clear nothing in our immediate vicinity
better and better mister spock
captain leaving neutral zone now entering romulan space scott enters the bridge
very well mister sulu
lieutenant when did the order come through
order
from starfleet the order to enter the neutral zone
there been no order know of mister scott
surely the captain couldn be doing this on his own authority
if you two have complaints you can bring them out into the open sinister shape appears on the viewscreen
that klingon ship but it couldn be not in this area
intelligence reports romulans now using klingon design
sound red alert man battle stations stand by main phasers
battle stations all hands battle stations
second ship has appeared another one decloaks correction there are now three we are surrounded
lieutenant uhura code message to starfleet command advise them of our situation include all log entries to this point
aye sir
mister spock your sensors read clear what happened
have theory captain
captain kirk receiving class two signal from the romulan vessel
put it on the main viewing screen lieutenant and complete that message to starfleet command
aye sir ship enterprise captain james kirk last known to be in command
your information is correct this is captain kirk ship is surrounded captain you will surrender immediately or we will destroy you
lieutenant mutes sound they want something or they would have destroyed us by now
true captain that would be standard romulan procedure
it my ship they want and very badly
it would be great prize
lieutenant sound on save your threats if you board this ship ll blow it up you ll gain nothing
my first officer commander spock yes commander yes commander no one should decide quickly to die captain we give you one of your hours if you do not surrender your ship at the end of that time your destruction is certain we will be open to communication should you wish it
you understand that starfleet command has been advised of the situation reach starfleet the decision is yours captain one hour
the design of the ship is the same mister spock you said you had theory on why your sensors didn pick up the new ships until they were upon us
believe the romulans have developed cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless
if so romulans could attack in federation territory before we knew they were there before vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up
they caught us right enough
well that brilliant observation mister scott do you have any other helpful opinions
we ve not got many choices
we have three we can fight and be destroyed or we can destroy the enterprise ourselves and keep her from the romulans or we can surrender opinions gentlemen
if the enterprise is taken by romulans they ll know everything there is to know about starship
if we had not crossed the neutral zone on your order you would not now need our opinions to support decision which should never have had to be made
jim you ordered us you had no authority
dismissed doctor
jim
said dismissed mccoy leaves
kirk here
the romulan vessel is signalling again sir
put them on the screen
put him on officer aboard this vessel it is felt this matter requires discussion
why should we walk right into your hands exchange hostages while you are here
what guarantee do we have they ll beam aboard our ship once we re on yours but you are the ones who violated our territory should it not be we who distrust your motives however we agree to simultaneous exchange
give us your transporter co-ordinates we re beaming aboard
one final order engineer scott if we do not return the enterprise must not be taken if the romulans attempt it you re to fight and if necessary destroy yourselves is that clear
perfectly clear
energise as kirk and spock beam out two romulans beam in once solid they draw their weapons scott scowls the figure in the curved chair swivels round to reveal that the commander is woman in uniform that barely covers her bottom and thigh-length boots held up by suspender belt
captain kirk
commander honoured
don think so but we have an important matter to discuss and your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion you are the first officer
spock
speak first with the captain you may wait outside spock and the two guards leave
the matter of trespass into romulan space is one of galactic import violation of treaties now ask you simply what is your mission here
instrument failure caused navigational error we were across the neutral zone before we realised it then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back
starship one of the starfleet finest vessels you re saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed until you were well past the neutral zone
accidents happen cut off back-up systems malfunction we were due for overhaul two months ago
see but you were able to navigate with this malfunction
the error was corrected
but doubt it ll clear you of espionage
we were not spying commander
your language has always been most difficult for me captain perhaps you have another word for it
you re grossly mistaken if you think we were there
captain if romulan vessel ventured far into federation territory without good explanation what would starbase commander do you see it works both ways hardly believe you are the injured party spock come in spock and the guards enter
the captain has made his statement
understand
must admit some surprise on seeing you spock we were not aware of vulcans aboard the enterprise
starfleet is not in the habit of informing romulans of its ships personnel
quite so yet there are certain ships certain officers that are known to us your situation appears most interesting
what earns spock your special interest
he is vulcan our forebears had the same roots and origins something you wouldn understand captain we can appreciate the vulcans our distant brothers have heard of vulcan integrity and personal honour there well-known saying or is it myth that vulcans are incapable of lying
it is no myth
then tell me truthfully now by your honour as vulcan what was your mission
reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as vulcan
it is unworthy of vulcan to resort to subterfuge
you re being clever commander that is unworthy of romulan it is not lie to keep the truth to oneself
then there is truth here that remains unspoken
you ve been told everything there nothing else to say
there is mister spock unspoken truth you knew of the cloaking device that we have developed you deliberately violated romulan space with blatant spy mission by order of the federation
we ve been all through that commander
we have not even begun there no force that can use on vulcan that will make him speak that is fact but there are romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses
you would not resort to them commander they would prove ineffective against the captain
then they will leave him dead or what might be worse than dead but will know your unspoken truths
let her rant there nothing to say
cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed the strain of command has worn heavily upon him he not been himself for several weeks
that lie
as you can see captain kirk is highly sensitive and emotional person believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision
shut up spock
betraying no secrets the commander suspicion that starfleet ordered the enterprise into the neutral zone is unacceptable our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness
you filthy liar
am speaking the truth for the benefit of the enterprise and the federation say now and for the record that captain kirk ordered the enterprise across the neutral zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory
having to be held back by the guards ll kill you you filthy traitor ll kill you ll kill you
he is not sane
into comm system attention enterprise am speaking to you from the romulan flagship of captain james kirk is formally charged with espionage the testimony of first officer confirming this intrusion into romulan space was not an accident first officer spock testimony was specific that your ship was not under orders from starfleet command or the federation council to perform such spy mission
it was captain kirk who was solely responsible since the crew had no choice but to obey orders the crew will not be held responsible therefore am ordering engineer scott presently in command of the enterprise to follow the romulan flagship processed and released to federation command until judgment is passed captain kirk will be held in confinement
security put our two romulan hostages in the brig lieutenant uhura give me channel to that ship
channel is open mister scott and you are tied in
this is lieutenant commander scott the enterprise takes no orders except those of captain he returns and if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the enterprise it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us
you humans make brave noise there are ways to convince you of your errors
did you hear that you coward you ve betrayed everything of value you ever knew did you hear the sound of human integrity
take him to the security room kirk is dragged out struggling
vulcan among humans living working with them would think the situation would be intolerable to you
am half vulcan my mother is human
to whom is your allegiance then do you call yourself terran or vulcan
vulcan
how long have you been starfleet officer spock
eighteen years
and you serve captain kirk do you like him do you like your shipmates
the question is irrelevant
possibly but you are subordinate to captain kirk orders even to his whims
my duty as an officer is to obey him
you are superior being why do you not command
do not desire ship of my own
or is it that no one has offered you vulcan that opportunity
such opportunities are extremely rare
for someone with your capabilities and accomplishments opportunities are made and will be will see to that if you ll stop looking on the federation as the whole universe it is not you know
that thought has occasionally crossed my mind
you must have your own ship
commander shall we speak plainly it is you who desperately need ship you want the enterprise
of course it would be great achievement for me to bring home the enterprise intact it would broaden the scope of my powers greatly it would be the achievement of lifetime and it would open equal opportunities for you kirk is finally flung into the romulan brig where he tests out the pain-giving properties of the force-field across the doorway
mccoy here
doctor you must beam aboard the romulan flagship immediately there been an injury
don make house calls
doctor it captain kirk mccoy is scanning kirk who is twitching slightly
he ll recover but he ll need further attention inform your superior she answers the comm listening on the earpiece they keep conversations private these people
yes ll come there attend me two guards walk discreet distance behind them
neglected to mention ll expect you for dinner we have much to discuss
indeed
allow me to rephrase will you join me for dinner
am honoured commander are the guards also invited she dismisses them they walk on and spock turns corner
mister spock that corridor is forbidden to all but loyal romulans
of course shall obey your restrictions
hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions
it would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable
are you the doctor
mccoy chief medical officer
captain kirk condition
well you can see for yourself he mentally depressed physically weak disoriented displays feelings of persecution and rebellion
then by your own standards of normality this man is not fully competent
no not now
mister spock has stated that he believes the captain had no authority or order to cross the neutral zone could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier
yes it possible
mister spock the doctor has now confirmed your testimony as to the mental state of your captain he was and is unfit to continue in command of the enterprise that duty has fallen on you are you ready to exercise that function
am ready
spock don believe it there no price you could pay that would make him sell out
the matter is not open for discussion doctor
what do you mean the matter not open for discussion
that enough doctor as physician your duty is to save lives mister spock duty is to lead the enterprise and its crew to safe haven
there is no alternative doctor the safety of the crew is now the paramount issue it is misguided loyalty to resist any further
you traitor ll kill you ll kill you ll kill you kirk lunges feebly at spock who places his hand over kirk face kirk falls back face contorted with pain
what did you do what did you do
was unprepared for his attack instinctively used the vulcan death grip
your instincts are still good mister spock the captain is dead the body of kirk lies on bed bathed in green light mccoy exits through one door and chapel enters through the
doctor doctor mccoy kirk eyes shut again the heart monitor starts thumping doctor mccoy
left orders that no one come in here
but he alive alive
well now that you know it you might as well assist me hand me the physiostimulator
but he was dead their doctors certified he was dead
spock gave him nerve pinch to simulate death
then mister spock isn traitor and you knew that and you didn
didn know it until beamed aboard the romulan ship jim and spock were operating under federation orders the green light goes out as kirk wakes up properly
oh sitting up my neck feels like it been twisted off
that the vulcan death grip for you
there no such thing as vulcan death grip
ah but the romulans don know that sure fooled the doctors
you took big chance they didn start an autopsy
as far as the rest of the crew concerned still dead
why
that what this whole masquerade was about to keep the enterprise and the federation off the hook
so that if anything went wrong you would be the one to blame
bones want you to prepare for surgery
what for
scott here doctor
sickbay can leave the bridge at time like this
you have to it urgent
we re surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us don know of anything more urgent than that
well do mister scott please
all right doctor it better be important scott out scott comes storming in and stutters to an astonished halt
all right doctor what so urgent that captain captain kirk
yes
well you look like the devil himself but as long as you re alive what it all about kirk has slanted eyebrows and pointed ears
are those romulan officers still aboard the ship
they re in the brig sir
ll need romulan uniform scott; aye it ll be pleasure
ve had special vulcan dishes prepared for you hope they re to your liking
am very flattered commander there no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the enterprise it is indeed very powerful recruiting inducement
we have other inducements she offers him glass of blue liquid he accepts they silently toast each other and drink kirk is in romulan uniform
what the devil is spock doing what delaying him
wish knew scotty are you sure we have clear channel to spock
aye sir no doubt of it
then we can wait any longer prepare to beam me aboard the flagship
but mister spock hasn sent the proper co-ordinates yet
it can be helped scotty
you re taking an awful chance jim
just don put me inside bulkhead energise kirk finishes materialising just before romulan comes around corner
centurion sorry no one is allowed
ve just effected an escape from the federation vessel have important information for sub-commander tal where is he
he in control central sir
good shall remember to mention your alertness to him return to your duty
thank you centurion now orange liquid is being poured out as spock eats
you have nothing in starfleet to which to return offer we offer you an alternative we will find place for you if you wish it
place
with me romulan women are not like vulcan females we are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion our people are warriors often savage but we are also many other pleasant things
was not aware of that aspect of romulan society
as vulcan you would study it as human you would find ways to appreciate it
please believe me do appreciate it
am so glad now one final step to make the occasion complete you will lead small party of romulans aboard the enterprise and there you will take your rightful place as its commander and you will lead the ship to romulan port with my flagship at its side
yes of course but not just this moment an hour from now will do even better would it not commander
yes yes it will mister spock you do know have first name
was beginning to wonder
well do would you like to hear it she whispers in his ear
how rare and how beautiful but so incongruous when spoken by soldier
if you will give me moment the soldier will transform herself into woman she leaves the room
spock to captain kirk
captain
already on board spock do you have the information
yes captain the cloaking device is in an area near the commander quarters it is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel what is your present location
sub-commander tal receiving an alien transmission from within our vessel sir
alien are you certain
yes sub-commander
must know the source
triangulating now sir
spock ll get the cloaking device will you be able to get back to the enterprise without attracting their attention
unknown captain at present am rather heavily he quickly shuts and hides his communicator as the door opens and the commander enters she is wearing figure hugging dress
is my attire now more appropriate mister spock
commander your attire is not only more appropriate it should actually stimulate our conversation he makes the vulcan v-sign she does the same and they touch hands
centurion have you clearance for this area do not recognise you
there an intruder aboard has someone tried to gain entrance there
must see your authorisation sir
over there he knocks the guard out now they are stroking each other face
it hard to believe that can be so moved by the touch of an alien hand
must confess that too am moved emotionally know it is illogical
mister spock we mustn question what we truly feel accept what is happening between us even as do the doorbell buzzes
not now tal she leaves spock and goes to the door tal and guards enter
enter
commander we have intercepted an alien transmission
locate its source
we have commander this room spock comes out from behind the dividing curtain and shows his communicator
the cloaking device bring him kirk manages to get in and starts looking around
halt don move who are you what are you doing in here
there an enemy spy aboard he ll be after the cloaking device
drop your weapon kirk does so and as the romulan bends to pick it up he kicks him unconscious as tal spock the commander and the guards make their way down the corridor kirk takes the globe with bits of nomad sticking out of it out of its control console
scotty energise
but sir what about mister spock
we ll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed
it ll have to hook into our deflector shield control
can you do it
don know sir
you have fifteen minutes scotty
commander the cloaking device is gone
full alert search all decks tal and guard leave
that will be profitless commander do not believe you will find it
you must be mad
assure you am quite sane
why would you do this to me what are you that you could do this
first officer of the enterprise broken-hearted she slaps his face what is your present form of execution captain log stardate 5027 commander scott has less than fifteen minutes to install the romulan cloaking device and get it working hope mister spock can buy us the time we need as scott struggles with the alien tech in engineering occasionally saying drat kirk gets into his own uniform and walks onto the bridge
captain
you re alive
they said you been killed sir
the report was premature
captain your ears what happened
we ll discuss it later mister sulu lay in course for home mister chekov take the sensors mister spock is still aboard the romulan flagship want his body readings pinpointed and isolated that was not request gentlemen
aye sir
aye sir
aye sir
return to your station sub-commander the boarding action on the enterprise will begin with my command if they resist destroy her tal leaves
execution of state criminals is both painful and unpleasant believe the details are unnecessary the sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges have been recorded
demand the right of statement first
you understand romulan tradition well the right is granted
thank you shall not require much time no more than twenty minutes should say
it should take less time than that to find your ally who stole the cloaking device you will not die alone recording the romulan right of statement proceed commander spock
my crime is sabotage freely admit my guilt scott is continuing to work the oath swore as starfleet officer is both specific and binding as long as wear the uniform my duty is to protect the security of the federation clearly your new cloaking device is threat to that security carried out my duty
everyone carries out his duty you state the obvious spock
there is no regulation regarding the content of my statement may continue
very well your twenty minutes is almost up
mister chekov there only one vulcan aboard that ship he should be easy enough to locate
romulans and vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike there is just slight difference which got him sir
feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal
captain kirk mister scott is on the intercom for you sir
go ahead scotty
ve got that device installed but bless me if know whether it ll work
stand by scotty
sir transporter room has the co-ordinates and is ready for beaming
transporter room beam mister spock aboard
beyond the historic tradition of vulcan loyalty there is also the combined romulan-vulcan history of obedience to duty she hears the transporter whine and runs around the desk to throw her arms around him
transporter room reports mister spock aboard sir and the romulan commander
the commander
aye sir
all right have them report to the bridge on the double mister sulu take us away from the romulans warp factor nine
sub-commander the enemy vessel is moving away at extreme speed sir
alert all vessels weapons officer bring main batteries to bear on the enterprise
holding at warp nine sir
scotty throw the switch on that device
did sir
would give you credit captain for getting this far but you will be dead in moment and the credit would be gratuitous
lieutenant open channel to the romulan vessel
aye sir have sub-commander tal sir
establish two-way visual contact cannot escape
this is captain kirk hold your fire we have your commander aboard
destroy this vessel gave you direct command tal
break contact
helmsman flank speed weapons officer stand by to fire main batteries as soon as we reach optimum range
scotty we re running out of time
captain working as fast as can
you see captain your effort is being wasted
mister spock distance from the romulan vessel
one hundred and fifty thousand kilometres captain and closing very rapidly
stand by phasers commander you ll forgive me if put up fight
of course it expected
one hundred thousand kilometres they should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds
scotty
it ready now captain but don know whether our circuits can handle this alien contraption
throw the switch
it ll likely overload
throw the switch scott does and the enterprise gently vanishes like cheshire cat
weapons officer commence fire sees enterprise disappear gone they have the cloaking device quickly compute enemy course from last position and open fire
yes sir
mister sulu come about three one eight mark seven
three one eight mark seven sir executing they cut underneath the romulan ship
the cloaking device is working perfectly and the commander has informed me that even the romulan sensors cannot track vessel so equipped
thank you mister spock cancel red alert we ll let you off at the nearest federation outpost
you are very generous captain if may be taken to your brig will take my place as your prisoner
mister spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters
captain
commander
deck two it is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger it was not intentional all the federation wanted was the cloaking device
the federation and what did you want
it was my only interest when boarded your vessel
and that exactly all you came away with
you underestimate yourself commander
you realise that very soon we will learn to penetrate the cloaking device you stole
obviously military secrets are the most fleeting of all hope that you and exchanged something more permanent they start to step out into the corridor
it was your choice
it was the only choice possible you would not respect any other
it will be our secret
entering neutral zone captain
very good mister chekov thank you mister leslie
what is it bones
well if all the shouting over up there like for you to report to sickbay
what for
captain please go somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable
well are you coming jim looking like your first officer
on my way theÂ  enterprise is orbiting blue and green world
ghost planet
suggest no supernatural explanation captain merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets
let take the facts one by one that should explain something
undoubtedly the age of this planet would seem to be only few thousand years it would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short period
its size is approximately that of earth moon
but its mass and atmosphere are similar to earth
that would be difficult to explain
it would be impossible captain an atmosphere could not evolve in so short period of time
and yet it has
evidently but the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present seemingly impossible phenomenon
but fascinating one mister spock
precisely captain
it would bear closer investigation it would seem if we re to provide starfleet with an accurate report lieutenant send doctor mccoy to the transporter room for survey party we ll also need senior geologist amato
aye aye sir
feed beam down co-ordinates to the transporter room mister sulu you ll accompany me mister spock you have the conn kirk and sulu leave
lieutenant rahda report to the bridge immediately
this expedition should be geologist dream mister amato
the opportunity to explore so young planet is an incredible bit of luck captain
yes if mister spock is correct you ll have report to startle the fifth interstellar geophysical conference
why what is it jim
planet that even spock can explain prepare to transport energise but just as they start to disintegrate woman appears in the transporter room
wait you must not go before they have fully beamed out the team see her touch the transporter operator and him fall to the floor blue and orange clumps of grass amongst the rocks
jim did you see what saw
that woman attacked ensign wyatt
captain captain there an earthquake which also shakes the enterprise
mister spock are you all right
yes believe no permanent damage was done
what happened
the occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair
no mister spock meant what happened to us
that we have yet to ascertain
woman in yellow uniform mister spock the planet gone
what kind of earthquakes do they have in this place
don know any more like that and they ll tear this planet apart
captain this tremor we felt if that what it was it certainly like no seismic disturbance ve ever felt before got reading of almost immeasurable power but it not there any more
could seismic stress have accounted for it
the reading got had nothing to do with seismic force
that very strange and that woman kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise come in the shock may have damaged it
it gone the enterprise it gone sulu hands over his tricorder
he right captain there nothing there
how could it be gone what the devil does that mean jim
for one thing it means we re stranded
the enterprise must have blown up that would explain the high radiation readings wouldn it captain if the matter antimatter engines
shall we stop guessing mister sulu and try and establish pattern get no readings of high energy concentration if the enterprise had blown up it would have left high residual radiation
could it be the enterprise hit the planet
once in siberia there was meteor so great that it flattened whole forests and was felt as far away as
mister sulu if wanted russian history lesson have brought along mister chekov this is matter of survival gentlemen without the enterprise we need food and we need water and we need them fast want detailed analysis made of this planet and want it now
aye sir
yes sir
mister sulu kirk hands back the tricorder
engineering no damage all power levels normal
damage control report ship functioning normally many bumps and bruises one casualty mister spock the transporter officer he dead spock; dead spock to sickbay
report on the death of the transporter officer
we re not sure doctor sanchez is conducting an autopsy right now
give me full report as soon as possible please spock out mister scott have the transporter checked for possible malfunction
aye sir
no debris of any kind sir ve made two full scans if the planet had broken up there be some sign but what bothers me is the stars mister spock
the stars
yes sir they re wrong
wrong
yes mister spock look now here replay of the star pattern just before the explosion
positional change
it doesn make any sense but somehow say that in flash we ve been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were
nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact lieutenant
but that not possible nothing can do that
mister scott since we are here your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation it is also illogical to assume that any explosion even that of small star going supernova could have hurled us distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years
the point is it shouldn have hurled us anywhere why it should have destroyed us immediately vaporised us
that is correct mister scott by all the laws that we know there was no period of unconsciousness our ship chronometers registered matter of only few seconds therefore we were displaced through space in some manner which am unable to fathom
what you re saying is that the planet didn blow up and the captain and the others they re still alive
please mister scott restrain your leaps of illogic have said nothing was merely speculating
spock here
you asked for an autopsy report it only preliminary but the cause of death seems to have been cellular disruption
explain
it as though every cell in the body had been individually blasted from inside
would any known disease organism do that
doctor sanchez has ruled that possibility out sir
please keep me fully advised spock out he was in the transporter room someone may have entered after captain kirk and his party left mister scott since the enterprise is obviously functional suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed
aye sir but even at that it ll take while to get there
in that case mister scott suggest we start at once can you give me warp eight
aye sir and maybe wee bit more ll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them
that position mister scott would not only be unavailing but also undignified lieutenant rahda plot course
already plotted and laid in sir
good then prepare to come to warp eight
your report covers all vegetation
yes captain all vegetation is inedible poison to us
if the enterprise has been destroyed you know how long we can survive
yes don see any water but there must be some to grow the vegetation source of water would stretch our survival did you see any evidence of rainfall
no sir and haven seen any evidence that there ever has been any rainfall
but there is earth-type vegetation
is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air
yes that possible there also the possibility of underground water
yes sir could be
sulu picked up an organism that almost virus like plant parasite it the nearest biological form of life can find
this apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last suggest we find out as much as we can about it split up amato see if you can find underground water
yes sir
sulu run an atmospheric analysis
aye sir
bones see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite how do they get their moisture if you can discover how they survive maybe we can sulu and amato have headed off to do their analyses sulu contacts kirk on his communicator
sulu to captain
kirk here
captain was making standard magnetic sweep from zero suddenly got reading that was off the scale then reverse of polarity and now get nothing ve never seen anything like this reading like door opened and then closed again
kirk out elsewhere amato is wandering amongst the purple tipped vegetation and picking up handfuls of sand he turns around and there is the woman
do not be afraid
not geological disturbances don frighten me ve come here to study them my specialty
know you are lieutenant amato senior geologist
that right how did you know that
from the spaceship enterprise
yes and we re stranded here you been talking to my friends
do not be afraid
not afraid
am for you lieutenant amato
you re you re the woman on the enterprise
am only for amato
lucky amato want to have conference about sharing your food and water
do not call the others please somewhere else mccoy gets out his communicator
mccoy to kirk
kirk here
jim just got life form reading of tremendous intensity suddenly it was just there
what do you mean just there
just that all levels were normal then get this biological surge of life form registering no now it gone
as though door opened and closed
yes
what direction
zero eight three
hang on amato section come in kirk to amato come in come in bones sulu amato doesn answer
ll be right there kirk arrives first we see pair of legs with boots lying face down behind rock
bones mccoy runs in and examines the body
jim every cell in his body been disrupted sulu arrives kirk adjusts his phaser
jim what are you doing
digging grave
poor amato what terrible way to die
there are no good ways sulu kirk phasers the ground but it only cuts shallow trench in the soil
that the same red rock
my phaser didn cut through it
whatever it is it has mighty high melting point
eight thousand degrees centigrade it looks like igneous rock but infinitely denser adjusts his phaser and tries again
this whole planet must be made up of this substance covered over by top soil
mister sulu it might explain this place little better if we knew what the substance is know it was amato field but see what you can find out
yes sir
well guess tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for amato
yeah it might be the most suitable memorial at that
wonder what killed him
don know but something or someone did
we re holding warp eight point four sir if we can maintain it our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one half solar hours
eleven point three three seven hours lieutenant wish you would be more precise
scott to bridge scott to bridge
spock here
mister spock the ship feels wrong
feels mister scott
know it doesn make sense instrumentation reads correct but the feel is wrong words
that is obvious mister scott suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct the cairn is complete and topped off with name-stone
it looks so lonely there
it would be worse if he had company
doctor how can you joke about it
not joking until we know what killed him none of us are safe
we ve got to figure this out and devise defence against it is it possible that the rocks have life
you remember on janus six the silicon creatures
but our instruments recorded that they were life forms they registered as life forms
unless we re dealing with beings intelligent beings who can shield themselves
beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the enterprise
that the problem sulu we have only questions no answers scott is trying to track down the source of his feeling and man in red boiler suit keeps looking over his shoulder
watkins check the bypass valve on the matter/antimatter reaction chamber make sure it not overheating
but mister scott the board shows correct
didn ask you to check the board lad
yes sir watkins goes off into an adjoining room and checks console and some panels in there then he is confronted by losira
who are you
my name is not important yours is watkins john engineer grade four
you know all about me ve never seen you before
show me this unit wish to learn
this is the matter-antimatter integrator control that the cut off switch
not correct that is the emergency overload bypass which engages almost instantaneously wise precaution considering it takes the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails am for you mister watkins
mister scott there strange woman who knows the entire plan of the enterprise but by the time scott gets there watkins has screamed and losira has turned sideways into vertical line then vanished
oh you poor lad scott to bridge scott to bridge
spock here
do you know what he died of mister scott
didn see it happen but his last words were warning cry about some strange woman
security alert all decks female intruder extremely dangerous security alert all decks dusk is falling the sky is dark purple kirk; conclusions
the basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium it couldn have evolved naturally
captain it doesn make sense in fact nothing about this planet makes sense
except for momentary fluctuation on your instruments this planet has no magnetic field the apparent age of these rocks is only few thousand years no known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time
are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet
but captain where are the people who made it why can we see them
the planet might be hollow they might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes it dark let get some rest tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it going to be very unpleasant stay
while it lasts
ll take the first watch sir
all right take amato tricorder set it for automatic distress you never can tell
aye sir sulu sets up the tricorder on rock ledge and leaves it beeping away to itself
spock to sickbay have you completed the autopsy on watkins doctor
was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer
well the pattern of cellular disruption was the same but as to the cause well your guess is as good as mine
my guess doctor would be valueless suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts
the power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in body combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the enterprise such distance speak of very high culture and very great danger
you mean that one of the people who threw us thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people
reasonable assumption mister scott
then you re right mister spock watkins must ve been murdered sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor there are no exposed circuits there it couldn have been anything he touched
if there are more of those beings on that planet the captain and the others are in very great danger while kirk and mccoy sleep losira turns off the tricorder sulu confronts her
am unarmed
who are you
that is not important you are lieutenant sulu you were born on the planet earth you re helmsman for the enterprise
how do you know this where did you get this information are you from this planet
am from here
then the planet is hollow who killed lieutenant amato all right the captain will want to talk to you that way move
you do not understand have come for you
what do you want
want to touch you
you were on the enterprise keep back stop or ll shoot don want to have to kill woman sulu fires his phaser at her feet then at her it has no effect
captain kirk captain kirk as he backs away sulu falls over stone losira manages to brush his shoulder before he gets away screaming in pain and kirk steps in front of her
hold it who are you
am for him am for lieutenant sulu
don let her touch you captain that how amato died phasers won stop her
am for lieutenant sulu please must touch him she puts her hand on kirk shoulder but it doesn hurt him he pushes her away
how can you destroy others and not me
don want to destroy don want to
who are you why are you trying to kill us
only sulu mean you no harm
are there men on this planet
please must touch him am for lieutenant sulu
no losira goes two-dimensional then vanishes
bones did you see that maybe spock was wrong perhaps this is ghost planet
well all know is she almost made ghost out of sulu his shoulder where she touched it every cell been disrupted exploded from within if she really gotten good grip on him jim
how can such people be captain such evil and she so so beautiful
yes know
security sweeps of all decks are negative mister spock no evidence of intruder
very well cancel red alert but maintain increased security
aye sir all decks cancel red alert maintain increased security
please update our subspace report to starfleet to include security search results negative
how did she get off the ship sir
presumably the same way she got on
yes sir mister spock what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive
lieutenant we are not engaged in gambling we are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen and factually ascertain whether or not they still live
yes mister spock
mister spock speed is increased to warp eight point eight
bridge to engineering
it power surge working on it reduce speed until locate the trouble
very well reduce speed to warp seven
aye sir warp seven mister spock our speed has increased to warp eight point nine and still climbing
bridge to engineering negative effect on power reduction speed is still increasing
aye mister spock and found out why the emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused are running wild there no way to get at them we should reach maximum overload in about fifteen minutes
would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes mister scott
those few seconds will not make any difference mister spock because you and and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth
and there nothing in the universe can stop it
there layer of necrotic tissue few cells thick normal wound would heal quickly
she just touched me how could it happen so fast
that good question she touched the transporter chief he collapsed immediately she apparently got to amato we saw what happened to him the question is why are you alive
captain happy the way it turned out
jim what kind of power must she have
the power to totally disrupt biological cell structure sulu alive because intervened but that raises an even worse question
yes why didn she kill you
she not through yet scott is working on the emergency bypass
it useless and there no question it deliberate
sabotage
aye and thorough job the system foolproof whoever murdered watkins sabotaged this
you said it was fused how
that what worries me
worries mister scott
well it fused all right but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it
interesting
find nothing interesting in the fact that we re about to blow up
no but the method is fascinating
whatever did this is still aboard this ship fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert
force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody
aye
as recall the pattern of our fuel flow there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber
there service crawlway but it not meant to be used while the integrator operates
still it is there and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point
what with bare hands
magnetic probe
any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion and not even sure man can live in the crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter
shall try
you ll be killed man
unless solution is found quickly that fate awaits all of us
aye you re right what have we got to lose but ll do it mister spock know every millimetre of that system ll do whatever has to be done
very well mister scott you spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong
aye it was an emotional statement don expect you to understand it
note it mister scott without necessarily understanding it propose to run an analysis through the ship computers comparing the present condition of the enterprise with her ideal condition
mister spock we don have time for that
we have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway while make the computer study
lieutenant sulu do you feel strong enough to move about
feel fine captain
is he bones
he in fair shape
all right whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time if correct when she re-appears the other two might protect the one she after by interposing their bodies no weapons seem to affect her
but captain how does she know about us does she read our minds there whining sound phaser on overload
controls are fused drop he throws his phaser away and it goes off with big bang
apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us come on let go
all right lads get the crawlway door open hand me the tools communicator all right head first hope mister spock knows what he doing scott is slid on his back into half-sized jefferies tube with blue energy streaks crossing it
scott to bridge
ve sealed off the aft end of the service crawlway and ve positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if rupture the magnetic bottle so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body
mister scott suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions you now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task point two and accelerating
heard that the ship not structured to take that speed for any length of time
you now have ten minutes and ten seconds
all right mister spock starting to open the access panel now spock begins his computer study
if the magnetic flow jumps you must jettison me the safety control rupture the field
aware of these facts please get on with the job computer
working
analysis on my comparison co-ordinates
unable to comply comparison co-ordinates too complex for immediate readout will advise upon completion
ve removed the access plate and ve got static electric charges dancing on the instruments looks like an aurora borealis in there
lieutenant uhura you are monitoring the magnetic force
oh yes sir
please do not take your eyes off of it lieutenant rahda arm the pod jettison system
aye sir ll jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble
not until my order
yes sir warp eleven point nine
mister scott what is your situation
it hard to see there so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field
you have eight minutes forty one seconds
know what time it is don need blooming cuckoo clock
captain getting that strange magnetic sweep again from zero to off the scale
yes like door opening and suddenly losira is there again
who have you come for this time
for you james kirk commander of the enterprise
keep behind us jim
why do you want to kill us
for defence you are captain james kirk commander of the enterprise
then why do you want to kill me
you are an invader
we re here on peaceful mission it you who have killed our people we mean no harm to you we want to leave peacefully
captain getting no life form register
an android
that would give mechanical reading getting nothing
who are you
am losira commander
commander of what
of this station
station station where how do you feel about killing me
feel killing is wrong
stay between us
you must not penetrate this station please must touch you
you want to kill me
no
then why do it if you don want to
am sent
by whom
we defend this place
are there others on this planet
they are no more
how long have you been alone are you lonely she does her disappearing act
she must be somewhere
she not registering
and there this power surge right off the scale like door closing it must be near here they walk on
is the power level still holding jim
right off the scale it remained at peak ever since she disappeared the entrance is here section of rock slides back and door opens
you think we re being invited in
it certainly looks like it and the invitation doesn exactly relax me
rather be on the enterprise sir
agree
we ve been led here why
don know but whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there and without the enterprise gentlemen the only source of food and water is in there let go
computer read-out
comparison analysis complete
continue
transporter factor m7 reassembled outphase point zero zero zero nine
fifty seven seconds to go
understood
spock here
going to try to cut through the magnetic flow but if the probe doesn precisely match the magnetic flow there ll be an explosion starting right now
magnetic force indicator jumping mister spock
mister scott ease off
magnetic force has dropped to normal sir
warp thirteen point two sir
computer for outphase condition will reverse field achieve closure
affirmative if m7 factor maintained
mister scott probe
reverse polarity
that ll take some doing what purpose could it
please commence ll explain enterprise was put through molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase reverse polarity should seal the incision
have no time for theory just hope you re right
doing the best can wait it stuck it stuck push the button
please continue mister scott
don be fool push the button it your last chance don be sentimental push it going to die anyway
please continue
it loose but there no time push the button scott gets his polarity reversed and puts the probe into the antimatter stream
eight seconds seven seconds seconds three seconds two seconds
one mister spock now warp fourteen point one warp fourteen
magnetic forces steady we hear the engines slowing down
warp thirteen point nine and dropping
mister scott you have accomplished your task
you might at least say thank you
for what purpose mister scott
never mind situation such as this two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated and yet you
feel that something else is necessary kirk mccoy and sulu enter purple room with cube hanging from the ceiling it is glowing purple losira is there did mention she is wearing purple
who have you come for form circle you see you better tell us tell us who have you come for who have you come for you re very determined woman for me
am for james kirk
gentlemen need your help
please must touch you beg it it is my existence
we ve seen the results of your touch
but you are my match james kirk must touch you then will live as one even to the structure of your cells the arrangement of chromosomes
that is how you kill you ll never reach me second losira appears
watch out
am for mccoy
that computer must be programming these replicas
the women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us third losira enters
it very painful affair can tell you
am for sulu
shift positions
captain we can no longer protect each other spock and security guard beam in
spock the computer destroy it the guard phasers the cube and the three losiras disappear
mister spock certainly am glad to see you thought you and the enterprise had been destroyed
had the same misgivings about you we returned and picked up your life form readings only moment ago
returned from where
from where this brain had the power to send the enterprise nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy what remarkable culture this is
was mister spock its defences were run by computer
surmised that captain its moves were immensely logical but what people created this are there any representatives here
there were replicas of one of them but that power to recreate them has been destroyed
that is loss captain
well you wouldn have thought so mister spock if you been among us an image appears on wall destroyed us beware of it after your long journey sorry to give you only recorded welcome but we who have guarded the outpost for you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet am the last of our advanced force left alive too late the physicians discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us in creating this planet we have accidentally produced deadly organism have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance but doubt now whether it will arrive in time will set the outpost controls on automatic the computer will selectively defend against all life forms but our own my fellow kalandans losira wish you well
the previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people the supply ship that she was waiting for never came all these thousands of years she been waiting to greet people who were dead
to do the job of defence the computer projected replica of the only image available losira
the computer was too perfect it projected so much of losira personality into the replica that it felt regret guilt at killing that bought us the time we needed to destroy it she must have been remarkable woman
and beautiful
beauty is transitory doctor however she was evidently highly intelligent
kirk to enterprise five to beam up don agree with you mister spock
indeed captain
beauty survives captain log stardate 5718 the enterprise is orbiting elba two planet with poisonous atmosphere where the federation maintains an asylum for the few remaining incorrigible criminally insane of the galaxy we are bringing revolutionary new medicine to them medicine with which the federation hopes to eliminate mental illness for all time am transporting down with mister spock and we re delivering the medicine to doctor donald cory the governor of the colony
donald good to see you
governor
gentlemen you don know what treat this is for me it been too long since ve had company the force field back in place now that means you two are trapped here and not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me
we be delighted
governor you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit making total of fifteen is that correct
it is the rehabilitation programme isn progressing too well and have my doubts about the effectiveness of this medicine too
why donald are you becoming pessimist
afraid have
total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what would call an excessive figure who is the new inmate
garth garth of izar former starship fleet captain he calls up picture on monitor
when was cadet at the academy his exploits were required reading he was one of my heroes like to see him
of course cory leads them down corridor using hand device to deactivate and reactivate forcefields rather than locking and unlocking doors
an orion woman captain you re making mistake
captain kirk is pressed for time at the moment marta
there nothing the matter with me can you see just by looking at me can you tell just by listening
she sounds rational enough captain
am rational
what is it you want to tell me
can tell you in front of him
you re afraid to talk in front of governor cory
he isn really governor cory at all that just it
she been saying that for days now our medical staff can figure out why they pass an andorian and tellarite
here garth he been unusually disturbed and we ve had to impose additional restraint the occupant of the cell is suspended in mid-air and looks exactly like their host
cory
in cell yes jim cory it true he tricked you the cory with kirk and spock changes into garth he unlocks the other cells and the occupants come out
you said you wanted to see me captain well here am during the opening titles kirk has been put in the cell with cory and spock is dragged away by the andorian and tellarite apparently unconscious
your vulcan friend is still alive captain my phaser was set to stun not to kill he ll be quite comfortable almost as comfortable as you and our esteemed governor
garth do you have to make him suffer like that
you will address me by my proper title kirk
sorry should ve said captain garth
am lord garth formerly of izar and lead the future masters of the universe
sorry lord garth
you earth people are stiff necked lot aren you
release him
afraid that subjugating you won be enough you must be confined and all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be confined or destroyed
captain garth listen to me
oh ho our beloved governor has decided to address us and we have not given him our permission to speak
are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned
releasing cory afraid of no one you re all powerless against me
thank you now what have you done with the medicine
the medicine you mean the poison destroyed it
destroyed it it was your only hope
silence the chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me and it time took command of the enterprise you ll help me of course
of course
my crew mutinied the first use will make of the enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that
the crew of the enterprise will also mutiny
but they won you see captain there helpful technique ve mastered and garth changes into kirk
good bye darling ll miss you garth-kirk and marta leave
governor cory how do you feel
all right there is no help for any of us if that madman is in command of the enterprise he boasts that he created the most powerful explosive in the universe and believe him
how does he manage to change form at will
the people of antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body by himself he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself into any form he wished the first time we knew about it was when guard seeing what he thought was me in garth cell released him
he was such genius what waste kirk is really garth remember the andorian and tellarite are with him
force field is on good remain here out of sight until give the order to join me kirk to enterprise
scott here sir
aye sir queen to queen level three
said queen to queen level three aboard
following your orders captain queen to queen level three
throws tantrum no no no ends up thumping the floor until he changes beck to garth
gave him the sign why didn he give me the countersign
something wrong
using the chess problem was the captain own suggestion he couldn have forgotten it and can believe he was testing me lieutenant re establish communication
aye sir there no response mister scott
send an armed detail to the transporter room immediately
aye aye sir
mister sulu what do your sensors show
we can beam anybody down sir the force field on the planet is in full operation and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are blocked off
we could blast our way through the field but only at the risk of destroying the captain mister spock and any other living thing on elba two
how can we be powerful enough to wipe out planet and still be so helpless
we are going to take the enterprise do you hear me we are going to take her if have to shatter every bone in captain kirk body
captain captain kirk well hope you haven been too uncomfortable captain
thank you for your concern all in all it been rather restful
good still ve been quite remiss in my duties as your host did invite you down to dinner as you may recall
forgotten
but haven you and mister spock are to be my guests
where is mister spock
right here marta spock enters with marta the andorian and the tellarite
why can blow off just one of his ears
stop that marta mister spock will think we re lacking in hospitality won you join us captain he lets kirk out of the cell
how are you mister spock
very well indeed thank you captain
isn governor cory joining us
no the governor doesn seem to be on the guest list
an oversight
an intentional one the governor fasting
in that case we must decline with thanks
draws weapon captain
don be fool jim go along with him
good advice governor well captain you ll find we set handsome table and the entertainment is most enjoyable
you re very persuasive
yes am certainly am other inmates are also there the current entertainment is the andorian and tellarite playing wheelbarrow when they ve finished marta goes over to kirk and starts fondling him
keep your hands off kirk you treacherous thing
you re jealous
am above that sort of thing the captain is annoyed by your attentions that all
am annoying you dearest
not really
he finds me fascinating and you re bothered by it admit it
may have you beaten to death
no you won because am the most beautiful woman on this planet
you re the only woman on this planet you stupid cow
well the most beautiful woman in this galaxy
you re repulsive
beautiful and intelligent too write poetry and paint marvellous pictures and am wonderful dancer
lies all lies you are the greatest liar have ever met let me hear one poem you ve written
if you like
muttering if you could create diversion might be able to find the control room and open the force field
all we need is few seconds if scotty has alerted the security detail
gentlemen courtesy for the performer
shall compare thee to summer day thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summer lease hath all too soon
you wrote that
yesterday as matter of fact
it was written by an earth man named shakespeare long time ago
which does not alter the fact that wrote it again yesterday think it one of my best poems don you
may kill you with my bare hands marta runs to the other men actually captain she is superb dancer marta my dear won you dance for our guests that was not request marta starts one of those sinuous orion dances although not as good as vina
marvellous isn she captain
yes er incredible
what is your reaction mister spock
find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic if understand the use of that word
nostalgic
yes it is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that vulcan children do in nursery school of course the children are not so well co-ordinated marta dance brings her up close and personal with both garth and kirk
she yours if you wish captain
oh er thank you that er very magnanimous of you
you ll find that am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies and want you both of you to be my friends
on what precisely is our friendship to be based
upon the firmest of foundations mister spock enlightened self interest you captain are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy
that very flattering am primarily an explorer now captain garth
and so have been have charted more new worlds than any man in history
and tried to destroy antos four spock: why
well could say because they were actively hostile to the federation
yes you could say but that would be untrue
agreed actually they were quite harmless and they made me whole when was maimed and dying and in my gratitude offered them the galaxy they rejected me and condemned them to death
how could you starship fleet captain believe that federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire antos race people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits
that was my only miscalculation had changed had risen above this decadent weakness which still has you in its command by the way captain my crew had not couldn sway them but my new crew the men in this room will obey my orders without question gentlemen you have eyes but you cannot see galaxies surround us limitless vistas and yet the federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill but am not an insect am master of the universe and must claim my domain
agree there was time when war was necessary and you were our greatest warrior studied your victory at axanar when was cadet in fact it still required reading at the academy
as well it should be
very well but my first visit to axanar was as new fledged cadet on peace mission
peace mission politicians and weaklings
they were humanitarians and statesmen and they had dream dream that became reality and spread throughout the stars dream that made mister spock and me brothers
mister spock do you consider captain kirk and yourself brothers
captain kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion however what he says is logical and do in fact agree with it
blind truly blind captain kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate that is all yet mister spock you are worthy commander in your own right and in my fleet you will surely have starship to command
please forgive me but exactly where is your fleet
out there waiting for me they will flock to my cause and for good reason limitless power limitless wealth and solar systems ruled by the elite we gentlemen are that elite and we must take what is rightfully ours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it
captain garth
lord garth
as you wish at any rate you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place
was betrayed and treated barbarically
on the contrary you were treated with justice and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims logically therefore one must assume
remove this animal spock is hauled away and garth draws his phaser as kirk stands then he becomes friendly again
try some of this wine captain it has robust full bodied flavour which you ll find diverting
no thank you prefer to join mister spock
and prefer that you remain here marta my dear we found your little divertissement enchanting didn we captain but there more to come the entertainment has merely begun by the way assume you play chess
occasionally
so do how would you respond to queen to queen level three
sure you re aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves
interested in only one
can for the life of me imagine which one
for the life of me is phrase well chosen it could literally come to that
dead am of no use to you
but can make you long for death beg for death
in the midnight of november when the dead man fare is nigh and the danger in the valley and the anger in the sky wrote that this morning do you like it
yes think it very good
tell him what he wants to know and we ll go away together
can
but you must beg of you
oh don beg marta it degrading queen to queen level three captain you ll talk freely and quite soon chunky chair is wheeled into the room what you see before you captain is my latest invention quite ordinary in appearance almost primitive wouldn you say
yes recognise it it used for rehabilitation purposes
it helped many men back to health
appearances can be deceiving once it was part of the rehabilitation process and as such quite painless and might add useless too it made men docile and of no use to me ve added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves the chair is no longer painless put the governor in it queen to queen level three captain kirk it is in fact exquisitely painful as you will now see the lights either side of cory head swirl and he begins to pant and groan
interesting isn it the pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely because there is no actual destruction of tissue
stop it garth turns it off
of course captain you have but to ask now as you can see he has not been harmed physically yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains queen to queen level three captain
no
too bad remove our distinguished governor put captain kirk in the chair kirk tries to make break for it but fails
no you mustn do that
you really are becoming offensive to me my dear don make it necessary for me to put you in it queen to queen level three captain kirk
please stop it
you want him don you
yes
badly enough to join him
listen to me my lord garth can get him to tell me what you want to know
it might be interesting to have you try
no breakthrough
no mister scott still no response from the planet
sensor readings
the force field is weakest on the far side of the planet we can send down shuttlecraft carrying team in environmental suits
it won work scotty they have to cover thousands of miles through poisonous atmosphere before they ever reach the asylum
aye you re right even if they made it they couldn carry anything powerful enough to break through the asylum dome only the ship herself could do that
probably kill jim and spock
doctor they may already be dead in an orange room marta gently gives the waking kirk drink of water
slowly darling slowly rest
is this more of garth persuasion marta
told him discover your secret lied would have told him anything to save you from that torment
believe you mean that
do kisses him this is where ve longed to be think knew loved you from the moment first saw you
marta marta can help you but must get to the enterprise to do that
that not possible
yes it is it is if can get to the control room and remove the force field then garth is finished
garth is my leader
he will lead you to destruction he already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you but there more medicine aboard the ship
ll help you but you must wait you do see that don you soon your friend spock will be here and then
spock
at least ve arranged that much
how did you manage that
convincing lie told to guard who finds me desirable darling she kisses him again then reaches under the pillow for dagger kirk disarms her she crawls after the blade and spock arrives
no you mustn stop me he my lover and have to kill him spock neck-pinches her
she seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity interesting
very glad to see you
thank you captain draws phaser we re now armed presume we shall try to reach the control room
yes you presume correctly they head along the corridor until they see tellarite standing guard spock stuns him kirk takes his weapon and they head into the control room
force field is now off captain
kirk to enterprise
mister scott it the captain
scott here captain
mister scott want fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double
they re already in the transporter room sir
and have doctor mccoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible
captain suggest you return to the ship at once your safety is vital to the enterprise
also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down
very well spock
mister scott the captain life is in immediate danger beam him aboard at once the security team will be entrusted to me level three
he waiting for the proper reply captain
scotty mister spock will give the countersign
give him the countersign captain spock reactivates the forcefield and turns into garth
blast away captain if you can do you think fool enough to give you charged phaser
what have you done with spock where is he
have done nothing with him as of yet but do have plans for him the vulcan will die rather horribly and his death will be on your conscience
captain garth
lord garth
no sir captain garth starship fleet captain that an honourable title
and was the greatest of them all wasn
yes you were yes but you re sick man now sir
have never been more healthy
no no think think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to antos four try
can remember it almost as if had died and was reborn
no can remember you were the finest student at the academy the finest starship captain you were the prototype the model for the rest of us
yes do remember that it was great responsibility but one was proud to bear
and you bore it well and the disease that changed you it not your fault and the terrible things you did since then not truly responsible
don want to hear any more you re weak you re trying to drain my strength
no not want you to find what you once had want you to go back to the greatness that you ve lost captain garth
am lord garth master of the universe you doubt me only because have not as yet had my coronation
no sir listen to me
stop on your knees
no
on your knees before me all the others before me have failed alexander caesar napoleon hitler lee kuan krotus all of them are dust but will triumph will make the ultimate conquest kirk reaches for the forcefield control and gets stunned for his efforts the tables are being rearranged
the throne must be higher it must be higher than anything else in this room use that table as pedestal ah welcome back captain kirk glad you could make it for the coronation
coronation
yes oh know that even real throne is no more than merely chair but the symbolism is important don you agree
yes agree you ll wear crown too presume
but again just as token not impressive in itself but it will serve as standard around which our followers will rally
garth you have only handful of men
you do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing don you captain perhaps you like larger role in the ceremony you could serve as human sacrifice for example
no wouldn enjoy that at all besides you seem to need me alive
how true all right how about crown prince that would make you our heir apparent heir apparent believe is the proper role for you besides we have other candidates for our human sacrifice who knows ready garth goes out and comes in again with marta on his arm she carries crown on pillow they walk between two lines of inmates who kneel
well since there is no one mighty enough to perform this ceremony we ll perform it ourselves therefore we hereby proclaim that am lord garth master of the universe and we designate our beloved marta to be our consort and we further designate captain james kirk of the starship enterprise to be our heir apparent garth walks up and down then climbs up onto the table and sits on the chair
now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony kirk is led out into the corridor by the andorian and the tellarite
listen to me this may be our last chance garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him and he using you you know that because he wants the power for himself brought something that might have cured you but he destroyed it if can get patrol down they bring more of that medicine and kirk tries to switch off the forcefield and gets hits for his effort garth enters
well done well captain you continue to resist how stupid of you put him in that chair right here ve arranged small entertainment wouldn want him to miss any of it well captain even you must admit that genius what you see here is my latest invention this is an explosive the most powerful one in history if were to drop this flask the resulting explosion would vaporise this planet now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me well perhaps you require the demonstration ve arranged watch closely shutters open to show the planet surface on screen
now it is true that she is deadly as poisonous serpent but she is also beautiful woman and you have held her in your arms captain ve ordered my men to drive her out of the protective dome and of course she would choke to death on the outside in minutes on the screen marta is struggling against two figures in environment suits
but ve arranged more merciful end for her because after all captain she is my consort one tiny crystal implanted in her necklace portion of this explosive no bigger than grain of sand propose to detonate it from here marta is left alone choking
poor girl poor dear suffering child will help her now boom
there been an explosion on elba two
point nine five
it must ve wiped out everything
immediate probe is the force field in place mister sulu
yes sir solidly
at spock station life continues to exist on the planet
got to break through it somehow
doctor told you we couldn do it without killing everyone in the asylum dome
know it scotty
well there one last thing we might try perhaps the ship phasers can cut through section of the force field at its weakest point where did you say that was located mister sulu
on the far side of the planet mister scott
will it leave margin of safety for the people below
yes sir
prepare to change orbital path mister sulu
orbital co-ordinates released sir
break synchronous orbit come to course one four mark six eight after few moments
course one four mark six eight synchronous orbit re-established sir
ship phasers to narrow beam
ship phasers ready sir
let punch hole in it full power another blast full power
force field still holding sir
here throws the flask of explosive to the andorian then snatches it back
how are your nerves kirk
all can say garth if it happens to me it happens to you
you re an extraordinary fellow kirk your stubbornness defies all logic logic that is the key your friend spock is logical man very logical man go and bring the vulcan here to me spock is in detention cell calmly testing the forcefield in the doorway when the andorian and tellarite arrive he is lying on the floor they have to pick him up and carry him between them once in the corridor he neck-pinches the pair of them takes phaser and heads off on his own
spock is not only more logical man than you captain but more intelligent one sure shall establish rapport with him an alarm alerts him to the approach of the vulcan
fascinating your vulcan friend is very ingenious fellow this could be most amusing when the control room doors open for spock two captain kirks are standing in the room
to spock left that garth stun him
to spock right hold it spock that garth spock enters the room
look at me carefully spock can you tell your captain
queen to queen level three
won answer that that exactly what he wants to know
very clever garth that exactly what was going to say
what are you doing
arranging to beam down security team are there any objections
yes they may walk into trap
that right garth can destroy us
fascinating what maneuver did we use to defeat the romulan vessel near tau ceti
very good spock the cochrane deceleration
spock you know the cochrane deceleration classic battle maneuver every starship captain knows that
agreed captain captains gentlemen whichever one of you is captain garth must at this moment be expending great deal of energy to maintain the image of captain kirk that energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely and have time spock pulls chair towards him to sit down and kirk attacks him then the two kirk wrestle each other finally one is holding the chair over the other head ready to smash it down on his helpless victim
with chair your captain spock can you tell shoot shoot
on floor he right spock you must shoot but shoot both of us it the only way to ensure the safety of the enterprise spock shoots the aggressive kirk with the chair who then turns back into garth spock switches off the force field
captain kirk presume
mister spock
spock to enterprise
enterprise here queen to queen level three
queen to king level one the inmates are getting their jabs
will intramuscular injection be satisfactory
intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible
how long before it takes effect doctor mccoy
reversal of arterial and brain damage should begin almost immediately garth is having treatment in the chair
captain garth james kirk
am mister spock science officer on starship
the starship enterprise
starship starship
yes sir the enterprise the captain kirk and garth shake hands can help
no captain the medicine seems to be taking effect can manage it very encouraging should know you sir
no captain no
mister spock
yes captain
tell me something why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us
it was not impossible captain our presence here is proof of that
yes and congratulations what took you so long
the interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief captain it only seemed long to you was waiting for victor in the hand to hand struggle which assumed would be captain garth because of your depleted condition failing resolution to the struggle was forced to use other means to make my determination
see mister spock letting yourself be hit on the head and presume you let yourself be hit on the head is not exactly method king solomon would have approved mister scott ready to beam up captain log stardate 5423 we are orbiting the planet gideon which is still not member of the united federation of planets the treaty negotiations have been difficult because gideon has consistently refused the presence of delegation from the federation on its soil or any surveillance by the ship sensors they have finally agreed to delegation of one they insisted it be the captain of the enterprise am therefore beaming down at once kirk; it too bad gideon isn cleared for general visitation mister spock according to the physio-cultural reports submitted to the federation it virtual paradise
shall be interested in hearing your description captain
you won have long to wait
lieutenant uhura
yes mister spock
do we have final clearance from gideon
yes mister spock they have provided us with the co-ordinates for beam down
may have them please
eight seven five
zero two zero
zero seven nine
let go mister spock
energising kirk dematerialises then re-appears in an empty transporter room
mister spock goes to intercom mister spock have not yet transported down why did you leave your post before confirming transport mister spock spock completely deserted
engineering
lieutenant uhura report immediately all bridge personnel report immediately
sickbay doctor mccoy
bones bones answer me
bones still orbiting gideon searched every area of the ship and still cannot find trace of the crew or an indication of how its disappearance was managed the one thing that is obvious is that suffered memory lapse during which time bruised my arm it is causing me some irritation
gideon is contacting us mister spock
put it on the screen
aye sir five men sitting behind slightly curved table the central one speaks council is still awaiting your arrival
this is mister spock ambassador hodin captain kirk was transported down minutes ago
transported him myself
he was beamed directly to your council chambers please verify your co-ordinates nine
co-ordinates confirmed have brought captain kirk directly to this very room
am not questioning that sir
if he is not here that is your own responsibility mister spock and that of your staff
do not deny that sir am not attempting to blame your personnel records of this most unfortunate event
your excellency even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours there is still margin for error which must be dealt with materialised on some other part of gideon
let us hope it was on dry land mccoy enters
your excellency may cut right to the heart of the matter request permission to beam down to conduct search for our captain
permission denied
of our jealous tradition of isolation from all contaminating contacts other star systems
your excellency the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy if you will grant permission in the meantime mister spock suggest that you look to your machinery transmission ends
we must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong crisis
well what are we waiting for mister spock we re not diplomats
we are representatives of the federation doctor
that doesn mean we have behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by diplomat
unfortunately diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment the planet is shielded from our sensors therefore we cannot scan it therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates they must be provided by gideon
we should never have agreed to such restrictions
we did not mister chekov the federation did lieutenant uhura
yes mister spock
contact starfleet immediately explain our problem request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for captain kirk
at once sir
are there any other possibilities
there are endless mister chekov
well where do we start mister spock
institute sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees one degree at time
you mean you re going to scan space for him
but sir that could take years
then the sooner you begin the better
aye sir kirk is checking each room when he sees young woman walking backwards from junction arms outstretched as she almost dances
who are you
odona yes my name is odona why did you bring me here
what are you doing on my ship
is this entire ship yours
not my personal property but the captain
and you have it all to yourself
it seems at the moment we have it all to ourselves he grabs her arm
you re hurting me captain
kirk sorry james kirk and didn bring you here
if you didn bring me
that right who has brought you here
don know
you what happened before you came here try to remember it important
it seems was standing in yes was standing in large auditorium crowded with people thousands pressed in against me could hardly breathe was fighting for oxygen screaming to get out
don be afraid
not but you are troubled
seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the enterprise four hundred and thirty and apparently am the only one left
sorry wish could help
maybe you can tell me the rest you were fighting for oxygen screaming to get out of there
and then suddenly was here on this on your ship and there was all this space and the freedom just wanted to float and then there you were
how long have you been aboard the enterprise
don know not long is it important
it might be come with me
lieutenant uhura has starfleet honoured our request with reply
there has been no response as yet sir
did you advise them the captain life is at stake
yes sir they insist that the matter must be referred to the federation
what department
bureau of planetary treaties
contact them directly
did mister spock they insist that we must go through starfleet channels
with the captain lost sir that the best they could come up with
diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently but they achieve exactly the same results kirk checks the ship chronometer on the helm/navigation console- it reads 9h 28m 29s
nine minutes of my life has been lost
don understand
between the time tried to beam down to gideon and the time found myself here alone nine minutes have disappeared just like that now what happened during those minutes
what is gideon
that your home the planet that you come from
is it
it must be
gideon don know any gideon
that impossible we were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of gideon tried to beam down something happened and you were beamed aboard from gideon
do not think so kirk switches on the viewscreen but instead of the deep orange planet it shows moving starfield
we re no longer over gideon
where are we
don know not familiar with that quadrant odona you must realise that we re not here by accident some force some intelligence has arranged this for purpose
captain before said wasn afraid now am
the ambassador will speak sir they re requesting visual communication
good news very good news indeed mister spock your captain is definitely not on gideon as you requested we made most thorough search and you will be relieved to know that you may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about gideon
you requested most thorough search it is in the record and we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you excellency
surely mister spock you do not intend hope to create dispute between the federation and gideon from our minds and there no need to check your records merely suggest that the language of our statement may not have been understood exactly as intended
mister spock you re an officer of spaceship in your profession you use many instruments tools and weapons to achieve your objectives
true your excellency
it is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear
your excellency am basically scientist clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also
glad to hear it perhaps you could then make greater effort to choose your words more precisely
are you going to let him get away with that
no matter what you say mister spock he ll twist your meaning
yes he infuriating sir how can you stand it
we do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done feelings about that
mister spock mister spock
yes your excellency
are you still there
yes your excellency
there was considerable interference with your transmission lot of noise drowned out please
apologise for the noise your excellency to summarise request permission to transport down to gideon
forgive me mister spock no criticism of your equipment was intended but it has sent your captain on some strange journey safe one we all still hope incidents with your federation and now you propose to
repeat this disaster with another officer this would be madness
ll not take that mister spock that transporter was in perfect condition guarantee that myself transport me down right this minute and ll prove to those gentlemen
mister scott you ll go to the transporter room and await my orders
aye mister spock scott leaves muttering
would you be so good as to repeat what you said
yes your excellency the ship engineer was explaining that the malfunction which did exist has now been repaired we would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment therefore request permission
but mister spock you
your excellency grant this one request
you are very persistent fellow mister spock very well then you shall test the skill of your very excitable
there is one proviso we cannot risk further incidents you will therefore transport member of my staff to your ship let us first see if that works
thank you your excellency your proposal is accepted mister scott
prepare to beam aboard representative of the gideon council
aye aye sir
my assistant will provide you with the proper what is the word
thank you proceed krodak
standing eight seven five
zero two zero
seven zero nine energising krodak disappears from the bridge viewscreen and appears in the transporter room
mister spock the gentleman from gideon is here
your excellency your assistant has arrived safely and am now ready to transport down to gideon quite different matter we agreed to allow one representative on our soil your captain
sir our captain is still missing and now demand that be allowed to transport to gideon as we agreed authority when made that agreement however your request will be taken up at the next full session of gideon council transmission ends
mister scott beam down the gentleman from gideon scott; yes mister spock sending him straight to the same co-ordinates
just when was beginning to think you might find whole new career as diplomat mister spock
do not give up hope lieutenant uhura contact starfleet command demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to gideon
yes mister spock enterprise to starfleet command enterprise to starfleet command
enterprise to starfleet command enterprise to starfleet command captain kirk here red priority red priority
isn it in working order
it seems to be
then someone should have heard you
captain kirk here please answer red priority please answer red priority well if someone is listening they re not answering
why should they do that
they wouldn kirk goes to the engineering station and swaps couple of tapes over
what did you do
took the ship out of warp speed
out of what
space terminology we re no longer moving faster than the speed of light ve trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are
it feels the same
of course it does maybe it is the same
well has the ship slowed down
referring to viewscreen if you believe that we have
oh please don tell me the sky is out of order now it so quiet so peaceful
it isn really you know
and it beautiful
yes yes it is very very beautiful
and we re alone can you make it last long long time
how long would you like it to last
forever
well let see power that no problem it regenerates and food we have enough to feed crew of four hundred and thirty for five years so that should last us
forever all my life ve dreamed of being alone
most people are afraid of being alone
where come from people dream of it
why why are the people of gideon like that
gideon told you don know where come from what my planet is
it might be gideon
does it matter so much
yes it might help me pinpoint our location
and then you might find your crew being here with you forgot there must be others envy you your sense of loyalty want to ease your feeling of dread your fear that all your crew no longer exists
ve got to contact whoever is manipulating us there must be way odona odona can you remember why your people dream of being alone
because they never can be
why what makes it so impossible to be alone
because there are so many of us so many there is no place no street no house no garden no beach no mountain that is not filled with people each one of us would kill in order to find place alone to himself they would willingly die for it if they could
who sent you here
no one commands odona was not sent here
you ve come to kill odona have you come to die
don know don care only know here only know happy they kiss and dozens of faces appear on the viewscreen they watch as kirk leads odona away
now all have to do is find medical kit and can completely cure this his arm
cure
yes the irritation would be gone
what will happen if you do not find one will you become sick and die
no over something as simple as this no it ll cure itself eventually but do you know uh don even remember how this happened do you hear that
yes it sounds like an engine
no the ship engines don make that kind of sound
but there is something wrong with the equipment could that be it
know every sound that this ship might make that coming from outside
storm might
storm might but you wouldn be able to hear it come on
this is viewing port we ll be able to see outside if there storm we ll be able to see it kirk presses button but the steel shutter does not raise
if it works uses manual override and the shutters slide open to reveal faces which are then replaced by starfield
people the faces of people and then the stars what happening what out there the sound is gone
it was like the heartbeat of all those people and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship
but you said we were moving through space
yes said that
then the people can be out there
yes they can
please don frighten me
it could be mirage they could exist in our minds
you mean that we re going mad
or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet but why
don know don know
think have an idea so that we won keep trying to find out where we are that we ll be content to stay here
oh be content
be content be content not until find out what happened to my crew are they dead
don know
did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself
captain to me never felt like this before sickness will be death she passes out in his arms the council members file out outside the window mass of people struggle to move towards their destination
hodin
yes captain kirk our experiment has passed the first stage
let me in there can help her
we have no need of any of your medicines
but she ill
and we re grateful to you for her illness you have done well my daughter kirk hands odona over to hodin
guard the captain well we shall need him for long time starfleet cannot override federation directives in this matter
admiral the crew will not understand it provoking war that is not starfleet mission
we wish only to save the life of the captain federation or to starfleet for that matter
am positive that can do so to your satisfaction admiral have been convinced since my first exchange with the ambassador that the captain has been taken prisoner
now know where the captain is being held if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him council chamber
sir the captain is not being held in the gideon council chamber he is being held nearby for your explanation of why
since the planet is shielded from our sensors we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation threatened permission denied
admiral wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary
will it last long
that depends on the strength of the one infected you have great strength
how will you know when am to die
your body temperature will be very great you will see us but you will not know who we are
must see him before then father
rest now lie still do you feel great pain
yes in my arms and thighs
what is it like to feel pain
it is like like when you see the people have no hope for happiness father you feel great despair and your heart is heavy because you know you can do nothing pain is like that
your courage gives me great pride
let me see her
not yet
you don know what she may have
but we do she has vegan choriomeningitis
it very rare and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours know it almost killed me
yes our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations that why we brought you here your blood provided the micro-organisms which infected her
that how my arm got hurt
yes as odona told you we have no need for medical practitioners here our apologies we were unforgivably awkward to have hurt you kirk has fight with his two guards and loses
you re mad
no we are desperate
don understand how starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain
they did not ask for our understanding doctor
don see how they expect us to sit here and wait for the captain to reappear
unfortunately must violate direct order from starfleet
that the best possible decision you could make spock with you
do not make it lightly doctor however command knows that ambassador hodin has not been totally honest with us lieutenant uhura repeat original gideon co-ordinates for beam down
eight seven five zero two zero zero seven nine
mister scott the co-ordinates given you
eight seven five zero two zero seven zero nine
co-ordinates don match
precisely shall beam down at once mister scott you have the conn
ll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room
negative doctor cannot accept the responsibility for ordering fellow officer to violate starfleet directive can make such decision only for myself
not asking you to make the decision for me
the situation forces me to do so doctor
in that case it the worst possible decision you can make spock
this will not take long spock leaves
isn that just about what captain kirk said before he left
into intercom captain kirk spock here captain kirk he goes out into the corridor scanning with his tricorder
your report to the federation was tissue of lies you described environmental physical cultural conditions that would make gideon paradise
and so it was long long time ago what we described was true the atmosphere on gideon has always been germ-free and the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection eventually even the life span increased death became almost unknown to us it occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself and that happens now only to the very old
those are conditions most people would envy
but gideon did not find it enviable the birth rate continued to rise and the population grew until now gideon is encased in living mass who can find no rest no peace no joy
then why haven you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women
every organ renews itself it would be impossible
then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception the federation will provide anything you need
but you see the people of gideon have always believed that life is sacred that the love of life is the greatest gift that is the one unshakable truth of gideon and this overwhelming love of life has developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity
and the great misery which you now face
that is bitterly true captain nevertheless we cannot deny the truth which shaped our evolution we are incapable of destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply life in every form from foetus to developed being it is against our tradition against our very nature we simply could not do it
yet you can kill young girl
we re trying to re-adjust the life cycle of an entire civilisation
you re killing your own daughter how can you do that
my daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of gideon but it was impossible no stranger could realize the horror that life can be here will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief nor will parade it for you to gain your co-operation my love for my daughter is too deep for display my pride in her runs even deeper my daughter freely chose to do what she is doing as the people of gideon are free to choose
the virus you need is very rare who will provide it
you will stay your blood will provide it
no sir not me you have many methods available ve mentioned only few do not offer my life for this purpose have many plans and have hopes other than death for odona
my daughter pleaded with you to stay
what was said and what happened between us was for us alone
she hoped you would love her and wish to stay
so that was your plan that would fall so under her spell that would give up my freedom and become willing sacrifice
stay with us we re desperate
odona fever is rising she calling the name of james kirk
you see you cannot leave us now go to her
an exact duplicate of the enterprise but completely inoperative into communicator spock to enterprise spock to enterprise
am speaking to you from the bridge of the enterprise
you re where
those were the co-ordinates you insisted on
and they were correct on board an exact duplicate of the enterprise
an exact duplicate of the enterprise is it in orbit mister spock
in orbit doctor in manner of speaking gideon is in orbit and the ship is on gideon
well that beginning but what about the captain
sure he on board somewhere picking up life readings spock out ship log stardate 5423 first officer spock reporting obviously the gideon have transported captain kirk onto this replica of the enterprise to so confuse his mind as to make him susceptible to some extraordinary experiment it is my intention to locate the captain and warn him before the experiment reaches its conclusion which logic indicates means the end of the captain life as he knows it
if you don allow me to bring doctor mccoy down here it ll soon be too late to do anything for her
we have told you it is her wish and mine that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus
her death is unnecessary even if she lives her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would
no her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our lifecycle can be changed it the symbol that ll bring forth the dedicated young volunteers the serum in their new blood will change gideon and it will once more be the paradise it was
glad that you are here is the time short
very short
and asked you to make our journey last forever oh it began here
and it can continue if only you ll allow me can cure you
not afraid of what will happen but it just that now wish with all my heart to stay with you forever she passes out outside in the corridor spock sneaks up on the two guards outside the captain quarters he neck pinches one and throws the other along the corridor then he enters the room
your excellency captain you re looking well evidently starfleet analysis was correct
mister spock we have patient for doctor mccoy have scotty beam us up
spock to enterprise spock to enterprise
scott here
negative lock in on my communicator signal your excellency please do not interfere already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons spock kirk and odona are beamed away
well that was close but you made it
am cured
right just like the captain mccoy leaves
instead of smiling at me you should be shouting in anger
why because you re well again
no because pretended to be pause how can you bear to look at me after the way deceived you
at least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you
you are gentleman captain kirk
thank you ma am
you are no longer needed on gideon can take your place there
is that what you want to do
that is what must do am needed there now
you re needed everywhere odona
it is not like our ship
oh yes it is it exactly the same only this one works
it goes to many other planets
yes it goes to the whole galaxy with another difference this one is crowded
it seems crowded to you
it does now crewmen pass by behind them
are you going to stay on the ship
yes odona have to
as crowded as my planet is could wish for it to hold one more person
into intercom kirk to transporter control one to beam down to the planet gideon
will miss you captain james kirk captain log stardate 5928 the enterprise has received distress call from group of scientists on camus two who are exploring the ruins of dead civilisation their situation is desperate two of the survivors are the expedition surgeon doctor coleman and the leader of the expedition doctor janice lester kirk spock and mccoy beam down into the expedition building dr lester is lying on bed asleep
what wrong with her
exposure to radiation
what form of radiation was it
nothing ve ever encountered janice wakes
janice you must remain absolutely quiet those are doctor orders not mine
captain tricorder picking up very faint life readings approximately seven hundred metres from here help will have to be immediate janice grabs kirk arms she makes noise
perhaps your presence will quiet her spock mccoy and coleman leave
hoped wouldn see you again
don blame you
the year we were together at starfleet is the only time in my life was alive
never stopped you from going on with your space work
your world of starship captains doesn admit women it isn fair
no it isn and you punished and tortured me because of it
loved you we could ve roamed among the stars
we have killed each other
it might have been better kirk has look around the room and finds wall-sized device with strange carvings janice sits up points remote at it and it lights up pulling kirk onto its surface janice gets out of bed flips switch on the device then stands in front of it too she flips another switch then the machine works we are shown images of janice and kirk going into the other body kirk steps down first and switches the machine off he carries janice back to the bed
you had your chance captain kirk you should ve smothered the life in me then they would have said doctor janice lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty why didn you do it you always wanted to didn you you had the strength to do it but you were afraid you were always afraid now janice lester takes the place of captain kirk already possess your physical strength only this captain kirk is not afraid to kill now you know the indignity of being woman for you this agony will soon pass as it has for me quiet quiet believe me it better to be dead than to live alone in the body of woman it better to be dead he makes to strangle her with her own scarf but is interrupted by the sound of footsteps
doctor mccoy your report
we were too late jim there nothing could be done
was it radiation as suggested
no believe it was celebium however doctor coleman disagrees to be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite
doctor mccoy he goes over to janice
did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone
no nothing at all she was unconscious all of the time
doctor lester is near death
perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem
sure it is
beaming her up to the enterprise will be less harmful than waiting
don know not sure
captain kirk to the enterprise captain kirk to the enterprise
mister scott prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others one critically ill have medical team standing by to receive the patient captain kirk out prepare to beam aboard kirk is carrying janice in his arms he puts her on gurney
doctor coleman accompany the patient to the sickbay mister spock take the ship out of orbit resume designated course doctor mccoy doctor mccoy you and doctor coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis
no not entirely we both agree it radiation doctor coleman isn prepared to say what form of radiation
will it affect your arriving at correct treatment
it crucial
well this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons
oh didn know you knew her that well
oh yes it been long time since saw her walked out on her when it became serious
well you must have been very young at the time jim
youth doesn excuse everything doctor mccoy it very unhappy memory for me
didn realise that shall do everything in my power
thank you thank you very much mccoy leaves
doctor lester is certainly very lucky young person to have escaped
yes very lucky very lucky janice is delirious coleman is with her kirk enters
it just began
well you better put stop to it if you allow doctor lester to become fully conscious she ll know what has happened
probably no one will believe it
probably
that all we can ask for how can death be explained now
tell you it can continue
you killed every one of the staff you sent them where you knew the celebium shielding was weak now why didn you kill him you had the perfect opportunity
there wasn enough time
gave you every minute you asked for
he hung onto life too hard couldn
you couldn because you love him you want me to be his murderer
love him love the life he led the power of starship commander it my life now
won become murderer
you are murderer you knew it was celebium you could ve treated them for it you re murderer many times over mccoy and now brunette chapel enter
jim what are you doing here
thought my presence might quiet doctor lester it seems to have had the opposite effect
it has nothing to do with you it symptom of the developing radiation illness
tests with the ship equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage doctor coleman
didn doctor lester staff become delirious before they went off and died
yes captain yes
doctor lester could be suffering from phaser stun as far as the symptoms can detect jim
doctor coleman doctor mccoy has had great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the enterprise am guided by his opinion
doctor lester and her staff have been under my supervision for two years if you don follow my recommendations responsibility for her health or her death will be yours
doctor mccoy sorry but going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to doctor coleman
you can do this on this ship my medical authority is final
doctor coleman wants to assume the full responsibility let him do it
won allow it
it done doctor coleman your patient doctor coleman didn you suggest sedation to rest the patient
yes captain
it not necessary jim can you see she coming around janice opens her eyes sees kirk and has flashbacks to the transferal just to remind us who is really who
doctor coleman
nurse administer the sedative
sedative is not wise at this time captain
nurse chapel you have your orders
nurse chapel follow your instructions chapel injects janice
oh no am really losing command of the enterprise no oh no bad dream bad dream janice lester the enterprise is proceeding to its next mission on the course set before took over command now the years spent studying every single detail of the ship operation will be tested with little experience will be invulnerable to suspicion at last attain what is my just due command of starship all the months of preparation now come to fruition
course mister chekov
one two seven mark eight
mister sulu set speed at warp factor two
warp factor two sir
mister chekov plot course for the benecia colony
direct course to benecia three seven three mark eight
how long to the colony at our present speed
forty-eight hours sir
mister sulu set course for the colony three seven three mark eight
aye sir three seven three mark eight
captain that will delay our work at beta aurigae it means reversing course
yes it can be helped we must take doctor lester to place where she can be treated
may point out that starbase two is on the direct route to our destination
how long to starbase two
seventy two hours captain
it twenty four hours too long doctor lester condition is increasingly serious continue present course
aye sir
if the diagnosis of doctor lester illness is the critical problem then the benecia colony is definitely not the place for her their medical facilities are the most primitive
they will have to serve
starbase two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor is that not crucial to your decision
thank you mister spock but the facilities will be of little use if doctor lester dead time is of the essence continue present course
at maximum speed starbase two would still meet the emergency
captain shall advise starfleet command of the change of plan
no change of plan has been ordered lieutenant our arrival at beta aurigae will merely be delayed our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer and life may be saved that is not unusual procedure for the enterprise
sir believe starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship potemkin will not take place as scheduled
mister spock if you concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible starfleet command would ve been informed already
since the captain usually deals with starfleet in these matters assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference
inform starfleet of the delay lieutenant
aye sir
continue present course increase speed to warp factor six kirk is sitting at his desk filing his nails
ll let my record speak for me
why are you being so defensive there no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case
that is not the reason here here because doctor coleman record states that he incompetent
that the opinion of an individual
no sir that is the opinion of starfleet command checked with them doctor coleman was removed from his post as chief medical officer of his ship for administrative incompetence
there are no administrative duties required here
as well as flagrant medical blunders
promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred you know that bones
not in starfleet headquarters captain and certainly not in the surgeon general office
afraid the order will have to stand can only say that doctor coleman experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here sure that you can appreciate that
appreciate the fact that you had decision to make also find myself in that position now jim and asking you to report for an examination
what what do you base that on
development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet
you ll never make that charge stick any fool can see why you re doing this
ll let starfleet command be the judge of my motives
won submit to this petty search for revenge
but you will submit to starfleet regulations and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about including the captain intercom whistles
captain kirk here
sulu here captain starfleet command is requesting additional details on the delay
ll be right there janice wakes up she looks at the monitor above her bed
pulse pressure blood count all body functions normal then why am here gets out of bed and notices that she is not herself
doctor mccoy doctor mccoy coleman enters
quiet would be best for you
where doctor mccoy
in charge now
bring doctor mccoy at once he is in command of medicine on this ship
he was taken off your case by captain kirk
by captain kirk
it was done for your own protection doctor lester
am not janice lester she did this to me now how can make you understand janice has driven herself mad with jealousy hatred and ambition chapel enters
nurse chapel bring mister spock and doctor mccoy to me at once now they must believe am not janice lester am imprisoned in her body but am not janice lester
she is suffering from the delusion of being captain kirk
am not janice lester
the paranoia has been developing for the past six months the radiation seems to have intensified it she must be kept sedated
shall prepare mild sedative doctor
of course chapel leaves janice sees her reflection in mirror
you are insane doctor lester captain log stardate unknown have lost track of time am still held captive in strange body and separated from all my crew janice wakes there is single restraining strap across the bed
must ve sounded quite mad to you before
what you ve been through would ve completely broken most of us
well ll be all right now could see your doctor mccoy
afraid that against doctor coleman orders
oh is visit by that very kind mister spock to be allowed
perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the benecia colony
the benecia colony but isn the enterprise going to rendezvous with the potemkin at beta aurigae
well first we have to let you recuperate at benecia offering drink you ll feel better if you have little
well ll try thank you oh it is good thank you could finish it slowly nurse chapel
well
promise ll be good
well ll be right back glad you re feeling so much better chapel leaves janice pours the drink on the floor and breaks the glass against the bed then she uses it to cut the strap holding her down
these tests should help me pinpoint the cause of jim illness
good knowledge of the captain aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship the crew is becoming increasingly tense
yes well what worries me most is that jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him we ve got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin
afraid that is forlorn hope doctor the illness appears to be primarily mental
one of us should be able to get to him keep looking for an approach but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult
perhaps the surgeon general office should be alerted
you know headquarters spock they re only interested in results of specific tests so far all we have to offer are our opinions
are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind
ll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary
doctor we are treading on very thin ground actions such as these might be misinterpreted
well then so be it our responsibility is clear
whatever happened to the captain on that planet must ve taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with doctor lester perhaps conversation with her might shed some light
well it worth try why don you try to get to doctor lester while examine jim kirk enters
well gentlemen here doctor janice has run down the corridor and now enters
spock bones help me don let them lock me away from you ve got to talk to you she backs out into the corridor and kirk follows her kirk knocks her out
jim
she might have killed someone two security guards arrive
put her in isolation in her room maintain twenty four hour watch no one absolutely no one is to talk to her without my permission
yes sir spock leaves
captain mccoy and kirk re-enter the exam room
how is the doctor
she regained consciousness very quickly
good have questions to ask her
did the captain order it sir
why should he they are my questions therefore am ordering it lieutenant
the captain said no one is allowed to speak to doctor lester
has such an order ever included his senior officers
no sir mister spock think the captain meant that guard should be present
by all means lieutenant shirt off kirk is doing the heart rate exercise
that enough that enough your heart will last forever captain
how am otherwise
in the pink as usual liver kidney blood count metabolic rate everything even your glands functioning at their usual normal peak of efficiency
good hope you re as pleased about it as am
don get dressed yet
you said was in perfect condition
physically
don think another test is necessary
the robbiani dermal-optic is crucial it reveals the basic emotional structure you had one once before now need another one to compare with that previous test there should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths over here captain over here captain
complete life-entity transfer with the aid of mechanical device
yes that what it must ve been
to my knowledge such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy
it was accomplished and forgotten long ago on camus two am living example
that is your claim as yet it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests
nevertheless spock it is the truth speaking kirk is being bathed in coloured light with his eyes closed
now lower your arms and open your eyes
at this moment doctor mccoy is examining the captain for psychological changes if any facts are uncovered that would be acceptable evidence the only kind which is acceptable to starfleet command and to the crew of the enterprise
spock when was caught in the interspace of the tholian sector you risked your life and the enterprise to get me back help me get back now when the vians of minara demanded that we let bones die we didn permit it
that is true the captain did not however those events have been recorded they could have become known to you
you are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe you know his thoughts what does your telepathic mind tell you now under the watchful gaze of the guard spock does quick mind-link
believe you however my belief is not acceptable evidence evidence must be factual doctor mccoy may be of help come with me
sorry sir but doctor lester cannot leave here
well are you satisfied with the results of the tests
there is no positive evidence of any disorder
you re asking me to violate the captain orders
he is not the captain
you re as mad as she is you re to leave here at once follow orders
certainly lieutenant we all must do our duty spock walks past him and feints neck pinch it is parried so he gets him with the other hand
security guard shaking hands
no hard feelings bones you did your usual thorough good job
sure everything going to be all right
captain kirk here
captain kirk to security on the double to doctor lester room
it quite all right ensign everything is under control neck-pinches him as mccoy and kirk arrive then two more security come out of the turbolift
phasers
repetition of your physical violence is not called for sir no physical resistance will be offered
attention all personnel first officer spock has been placed under arrest he has conspired with doctor lester to take over the ship from your captain hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of general court martial on the charge of mutiny captain log stardate 5930 the results of doctor mccoy examination have given me complete confidence in myself my fears are past shall function freely as the captain am the captain of the enterprise in fact scott is questioning spock but the log entry obliterates some of the evidence
surely you must have more than that to go on
have stated my evidence telepathic communication with the mind of captain james kirk
your evidence is completely subjective we have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open
you ve had great deal of evidence except that of the chief witness the one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation why captain
she dangerously insane we ve seen the evidence
she is dangerous only to your authority sir
mister spock mister spock my authority has been given to me by starfleet command and only that high authority can take it away
the witness sir bring on the witness let your officers put the questions
mister lemli have doctor janice lester brought here
aye sir the security man leaves
doctor mccoy while mister spock was busy with his ambitious plot what were you doing
examining you
oh yes you were deeply concerned about my health emotional and physical since leaving camus two is that correct
yes that correct
instead of trying to destroy me you were searching for ways to help me doctor mccoy for the record will you tell the court your findings
the captain is in the best of physical condition his emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the enterprise
thank you doctor mccoy mister spock were you aware of doctor mccoy findings
know them now
and what have you to say now
am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position so far lemli enters with janice and coleman
doctor coleman if you re required here we ll call you coleman leaves janice takes the witness stand
we certainly appreciate your being here everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress we had hoped to avoid any further stress but mister spock disagrees it is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case and since we are solely interested in arriving at just decision going to have to ask you few more questions ll try not to upset you you claim that that you are captain james kirk
no am not captain kirk that is very apparent claim that whatever it is that makes james kirk living being special to himself is being held here in this body
oh well however as understand it am doctor janice lester
that very clever but didn say it said the body of james kirk is being used by doctor janice lester
subtlety that somehow escapes me assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement
no it was brought about by violent attack by doctor lester and the use of equipment she discovered on camus two
violence by the lady perpetrated on captain kirk ask the assembled personnel to look at doctor janice lester and visualise that historic moment can you can you tell me why doctor janice lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange
yes to get the power she craved to attain position she doesn merit by temperament or training and most of all she wanted to murder james kirk man who once loved her but her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible
are you prepared with witnesses one will do
sir there is only one issue here is the story of life-entity transfer believable this crew has been to many places in the galaxy they ve been witness to many strange events they are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon
mister spock have you ever heard of case such as described by doctor janice lester
not precisely no
oh assuming that you are correct in your belief do you expect starfleet command to place this er this er person in command of the enterprise
expect only to reveal the truth
and with the truth revealed that am not really the captain and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain then you would be the captain it is inevitable spock spock give it up return to the enterprise family all charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on camus two will fade and be forgotten
and what will become of doctor lester
doctor lester will be cared for always it is debt and responsibility owe her from the past
no sir shall not withdraw single charge that have made you are not captain kirk you have ruthlessly appropriated his body but the life entity within you is not that of captain kirk you do not belong in charge of the enterprise and shall do everything in my power against you
lieutenant lysa play back those last two sentences from mister spock tirade do everything in my power against you
you heard the statements placed into the record by you do you understand the nature of it
do and stand by it
thumping the table it is mutiny deliberate vindictive insane at its base but mutiny is charged and encouragement to mutiny doctor mccoy mister scott you heard it on the basis of these statements call for an immediate vote by the powers granted to me as captain of the enterprise recess is declared to be followed by vote
yes sir an immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her
silence you will be silent recess has been declared there will be no cross-discussion when return we will vote on the charge of mutiny the evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision
scotty
doctor doctor ve seen the captain feverish sick drunk delirious terrified overjoyed boiling mad but up to now have never seen him red-faced with hysteria know how going to vote
ve been through this with spock he not being scientific and neither are you
it may not be scientific but if mister spock thinks it happened then it must be logical
don you think know that my tests show there nothing wrong with the captain now that the only fact starfleet going to be interested in
headquarters has its problems and we have ours and right now the captain of the enterprise is our problem they re going to call for the vote in few minutes let me put one last question suppose you vote with me in favour of spock that means two votes to one and spock is free what do you think the captain ll do
don know
aye you know all right it ll stick in his craw he ll never accept it
we don know that
tell you he won then doctor that the time we move against him we ll have to take over the ship
we re talking about mutiny scotty
aye are you ready for the vote
yes ready for the vote
play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor
aye sir over the ship
that enough we know what was said
enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers and you re so charged the sentence death mister lemli
starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty
all my senior officers turning against me
the death penalty is forbidden there only one exception
general order four it has not been violated by any officer on the enterprise
am responsible the execution will be immediate go to your posts go to your posts chekov and sulu leave
mister lemli take them to the brig prepare for execution go on scott and mccoy are escorted out at phaser point janice follows and spock follow also under armed guard
the captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution
captain kirk wouldn order an execution even if he were going mad that cannot be the captain
what difference does it make who he is are we going to allow an execution to take place
if security backs him up how will we fight him
ll fight them every way and any way can kirk enters
lieutenant lysa inform all sectors of my decision have each section send representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck mister chekov how far to the benecia colony
coming within scanning range
plot co-ordinates for orbit mister sulu lock into co-ordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished interment will take place on benecia chekov and sulu remove their hands from their controls
you have received your orders you will obey my orders you ll be charged with mutiny you will obey my orders or or he starts convulsing and janice is doing the same in the brig
for moment thought that was up on the bridge
perhaps you were
then it possible the transference can be broken
well if it happens again ll fight to stay there
the bridge is where you belong
to accomplish that each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack
arthur the transference is weakening
what happened
for moment found myself back with the prisoners will not go back to being janice lester you must help me prevent it
the only way to prevent the transference is by the death of janice lester you must carry out the execution
can can the crew is in mutiny you must kill her for me
have done everything else for you but will not murder for you
then do it for yourself if kirk doesn die we ll both be exposed as murderers does that give you any choice coleman gets phaser and hypo-spray
the dosage should be doubly lethal
it is which strangely looks straight out into the corridor
to prevent further conspiracy you will be removed to separate cells if there any resistance you ll be given sedative until you learn co-operation doctor lester will be first follow doctor coleman janice steps out into the corridor
may point out captain janice struggles with coleman
kill him kill him then kirk goes into another convulsion the rest of the prisoners stroll into the corridor as the transfer undoes itself
ohh ve lost to the captain ve lost to james kirk want you dead want you dead want you dead oh never going to be the captain never kill him she goes to coleman arms to weep
you are you are as loved you
kill him
can you do anything for her
like to take care of her
of course come with me
didn want to destroy her
sure we all understand that captain
her life could have been as rich as any woman if only if only ship log stardate 5710 lieutenant commander scott reporting while exploring an outer quadrant of the galaxy the enterprise received distress calls from an apparently uninhabited incredibly beautiful city on the planet of scalos captain kirk and landing party have beamed down to investigate blue background of extraordinary architecture and humanoid statue
what do your sensors read figure out what it is
specify we may have malfunction about to check circuits sir
you do that lieutenant uhura does the location of the distress call correspond with this area
yes sir am still receiving visual contact can see them but can see you the viewscreen has five people standing in an area with the same architecture behind them
co-ordinates correspond captain
well apart from the landing party there no one here there are no scalosians pleading for immediate assistance
check circuits for malfunctions kirk out
it must be malfunction this is barren world there hardly any vegetation no apparent animal life
when we ve run analysis we should have some explanation waves away buzz but there is an insect life
my tricorder doesn register it
it registers in my ears nothing mister spock
evidently civilisation of high order rating number seven on the industrial scale humanoid in appearance according to the paintings an abundance of literature which shall have translated and processed certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned
no sign of present life
instrument readings indicate life-form but of highly unusual and intermittent nature they have no discernible form or location most puzzling phenomenon captain shall have to study it further
something was here we saw them on the screen lieutenant uhura is still getting distress call what happened
unknown at present captain
mister spock want you to run survey complete survey of the planet using all ship available instruments mccoy turns to hear buzz then his assistant disappears
compton
what happened mccoy; was looking at him was looking right at him and he and he just wasn there
lieutenant uhura start replay of the distress call scotty are the transporter controls functioning now
aye sir is mister spock still down there
no he in sickbay doctor mccoy is running check on the landing party what is it lieutenant
malfunction sir
mister sulu would like
captain it corrected itself
captain there some trouble on the hangar deck the controls are frozen
have repair crews been assigned
yes sir
the tape is ready sir
play it spock enters as the viewscreen displays scalos and that statue range of the planet scalos send you an urgent appeal for help my comrades and are the last surviving members of what was once thriving civilisation those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area we have no explanation for what has been happening to us our number is now five we were once nation of nine hundred thousand
freeze it
it is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded what we received was evidently delayed taped message
that would explain our continuing to receive it while our sensors only picked up the landing party sir
the fact remains when we beamed down there we couldn find these people they were there now they re not nor is crewman compton
it would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible
mister sulu want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation
sir now have readings that deflectors are inoperative the controls are frozen
scotty assist
mister spock ever since we beamed up from scalos we ve had series of malfunctions want an investigation and an explanation is requested
can it wait bones
what do you read so far
on my way mister spock you have the conn
what is it
tell the captain what you told me
something going on captain somebody opened all the medical supply cabinets
anything missing
just disordered as though someone had picked up everything and examined it
thank you
lie down jim
that fits in with other disturbances bones what did your readings show up on the other men
all perfectly normal whatever happened to compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else
any of them report any unusual experience since beaming
no there no mention of it the buzzing sound kirk starts to sit up
not finished yet
hold on bones could something be making me hallucinate
what do you mean
mean that twice before something touched me and there was nothing there and it just happened again could be imagining it
physically there nothing wrong with you
but am hallucinating
say no
then we did beam something aboard something has invaded the ship kirk to spock come in spock come in centre
spock can hear you check your circuits is there malfunction
lieutenant ship wide order use communicators instead of intercom issue phasers to all crew members spock repeat
have reading from life support centre alien substances being introduced
meet me there on the double spock hands kirk phaser the two security men running ahead hit forcefield and fall down
spock
it is force field captain the nature of which not familiar with getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet surface but they seem to have no exact location
phasers on stun sweep the area the corridor goes green as they fire then they all walk forward but the two security men are stopped again by the force field
it would seem captain that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter should advise caution there is contraption hooked up to life support
what is it
unknown captain but it is evidently device of alien origin
hooked into the life support designed to affect it
life support is still operating would say that the installation is incomplete
disconnect it spock gets shock from it destroy it their phasers disappear from their hands then they are pushed backwards
that was no force field something shoved me back they re in here you what are you doing on my ship show yourselves
it seems that we may look at it captain but that is all
show of strength
yes evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us
have your readings been fed into the computer
affirmative
read out
computer analyse and reply have we been invaded
affirmative
nature and description of enemy forces
data insufficient
number of enemy forces
data insufficient
purpose of the invasion
immediate purpose seizure and control of federation star ship enterprise and crew data insufficient for determination of end purpose
is there connection between this and compton disappearance
data insufficient
are we at present capable of resisting
negative
your recommendation
if incapable of resistance negotiate for terms
we will not negotiate do you concur
aye
mister spock
your recommendations captain
yeoman is that coffee available or have those circuits been damaged as well takes cup from her tray my recommendation make them take the next step kirk hears that buzzing again we see his coffee bubble briefly he takes drink grimaces it is black coffee then everything around him slows down and finally stops
spock
the woman from the distress call captain
would you mind explaining she kisses him who are you
deela the enemy
you re the enemy
yes you beamed me aboard yourself when you came up ridiculously long process but ve taken care of it
what have you done with my men
nothing
nothing mister spock scotty this is nothing
there really nothing wrong with them they are just as they have always been it you who are different
lieutenant sulu this is nothing
they cannot hear you captain to their ears you sound like an insect that your description captain accurate if unflattering really there is nothing wrong with them
what have you done
changed you so you are like me now your crew cannot see you or any of us because of the acceleration we move in the wink of an eye oh there is scientific explanation for it but all that really matters is that you can see me and talk to me and we can go on from there
why
because like you didn you guess or are you so accustomed to being kissed by invisible women she kisses him again but he doesn respond
deela is this why you sabotaged my ship
oh but it has not been sabotaged we we had to make some changes in it to adjust it to us
you said we
yes of course my chief scientist and his crew am their queen you are going to be their king you ll enjoy living on scalos
what about my ship my crew
oh in few of their moments they will realise that you ve vanished they will look for you but they will not find you you re accelerated far beyond their power to see so they ll go on without you don be so stubborn you cannot go back to them ever is it so dreadful prospect
draws his phaser this won kill you but the stun effect is not very pleasant
but that won work you go ahead and try point it right at me she sidesteps the slow phaser beam easily
my reactions are much too fast for such crude weapon and am quite good at self-defense too this can be set for stun and destroy too like yours his phaser goes flying please accept what has happened there is nothing you can do to change it
if agree to go with you will you set this ship to rights take out that device in the life-support system
don be so silly you ll feel better about it all in little while it always happens this way they are very upset at first then it wears off and they they learn to like it you will too kirk leaves}
he on his way to you be gentle with him meanwhile in our normal time-frame
captain captain kirk he gone
lieutenant did you see what happened
well he was sitting there he just drunk his coffee and set his cup down you see it still there and then he vanished
mister sulu do you verify
that just what happened he was there then all of sudden he wasn there
captain kirk you ve made it
compton did they accelerate you
yes sir
they hooked something into the life support system they re in there we ve got to get rid of it
sorry sir entry is forbidden
by whose order
the commander sir you ll have to step back please
your commander compton order you to let me in
sorry sir you are no longer
who is deela is that who you re working for
at first refused but then after while found couldn help myself met this girl she one of them ve never known anyone like her she brought me aboard to show them operation of the ship bridge controls life support she explained that they wanted to know didn understand at first but do now so will you sir
all right compton kirk turns away then quickly disarms compton and enters two scalosian males are there
stun kirk falls gently to the floor compton enters and attacks the man with the weapon he is knocked down for his loyalty
you were ordered to stop him why did you disobey
tried to stop him you hurt him
he was violent he had to be subdued
he was my captain
cell damage
to young woman another will be secured for you
getting trace reading similar to that on the planet mister sulu did you drink your coffee
yes
did anyone else
had some
may
was it the coffee are we going to go too just like the captain
cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed
by that time it ll be too late
suggest that we recall the captain words make them take the next step it would seem they have taken it and we must determine effective countermeasures mister scott you have the conn shall be in the medical lab deela is kneeling next to the still-unconscious kirk
hate what happens to them when they re damaged you re going to have to learn to control your temper rael do not want that to happen to this one if they are so stubborn species perhaps they will last longer
it may be
hope so they all go so soon want to keep this one long time he pretty
he is inferior deela
oh don think so
you cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to such
can allow myself anything want oh rael don be like that am jealous of what you do
do my duty
so do and sometimes allow myself to enjoy it kirk wakes up
hello
what is that device doing on my ship
deela will explain it
will tell you anything you want to know and you ll approve of it
approve of it we re your prisoners
hardly you re free to go anywhere you want to
go ahead captain it is not yet completely linked to your support system but it is in operating order study it if you wish suggest that you do not touch it kirk touches the device briefly then clamps both hands firmly onto it in an act of defiance deela pulls them off
he told you not to touch it look at your hands they re almost frozen aren they it will pass
the unit has its own self-defence mechanism as you see you should ve heeded me kirk sees compton on the floor the young man now looks very old
in your struggle with compton some of his cells were damaged those newly accelerated to our level are sensitive to cell damage they age rapidly and die
he was so young
was
this is what you have planned for us
we all die even on scalos kirk leaves
why did you lie to him he did not damage that one you did
perhaps he will be less violent now
see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to
why do you care what he feels
rael he not one of us he temporary getting message via her collar device he gone to the medical laboratory he trying to communicate with the vulcan his species is capable of much affection
have noted that
wonder if they will demonstrate it to us oh rael stop sulking accept it we ve had to accept it all our lives don make it worse rael kisses deela
go back to work in fast time kirk is using computer console whilst mccoy chapel and spock are motionless at another bench examining test results
kirk to spock have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks deela enters
go ahead you won accomplish anything but it may be historically valuable
hyperacceleration is the key have counted only five of them aboard but they have taken over the ship and we are under their control due to this acceleration they are able to speed others up to their level as they did compton and me presumably this is enslavement those so treated exist at this accelerated level becoming docile eventually but when
damaged
damaged they age incredibly fast as though accelerated living
burns them out
burns them out compton was burned out the device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme numbing cold it is my belief that they are turning the enterprise into gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the scalosians know
quite correct
the unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact don know how to destroy it but its destruction is imperative
the unit will be activated by the time they hear this it will be too late you have remarkable reasoning powers captain you were quite right in almost every assumption
why are you doing this
do you really want to know in little while it won matter to you at all you ll be quite happy about it just as compton was
really want to know
oh dear you are so stubborn it should be obvious to you that we re doing it because we have to long time ago it is in our history we used to be like you then our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions the water was polluted radiation was released that changed us it accelerated us the children died most of the women found they could not have more all of our men had become sterile so we had to mate outside our own people whenever spaceship came by we send our calls for help but accelerating them to our level burned them out don you see captain do have to go into every detail we are going to take you down with us perhaps one or two others of your crew we have to we ll be kind to you wouldn hurt you certainly do like you
what about the rest of my crew
they ll remain here in suspended animation it will do them no harm we are saving them for when we need them in the future you will not last forever you know that captain captain we have the right to survive
not by killing others
you were doing exactly the same thing you came charging into that life-support room the minute you knew there was trouble you would have killed every one my people if you could have
you invaded my ship you threaten my crew
there is no difference
there is difference your trouble is in you
we did not ask for it we are not to blame we are handling it the only way we know how the way our parents and their parents before them
did they solve anything have you tried any other way deela have your scientists disconnect destroy that unit promise you we ll use every skill we have to help you we ll move you to another planet we ll call on the most brilliant minds in our federation to help we ll do it
we have tried other ways we ve tried to make the transition to your level some of us that is those who made the attempt died we are trapped captain just as you are trapped now sorry for what going to happen to you but cannot change it you cannot change me there and beam down
with the captain to allow all of us time to get off the ship please don delay meanwhile kirk slips his computer tape into the machine spock is working at then he slips out
just what makes you think would do that the captain gone
go after him deela in real time
there no question about it spock want you to take look at this the same substance is in the captain coffee as in the scalosian water and there no trace of it in any other cups kirk removed vital component from the control console before deela enters she draws her weapon
why did you run
panicked
don believe that
like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device
into her comm unit we re in the transporter room you can activate
captain kirk stands on the transporter pad deela activates the controls but nothing happens
what have you done to the transporter captain
it was working before try it again
into her comm unit the transporter isn working
what he do to it
it must be what do you call it malfunction you better not activate the unit yet what would you say it is captain
the technicians reported loss of power that must be it
the captain says his technicians
expect you to check into all possible causes if had suspicious nature captain would say that you sabotaged the transporter to buy time
yes of course
glad we re both innocents despise devious people don you
believe in honest relationships myself
nurse programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents there buzz doctor did you just
ve been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to scalos
know what it is we brought it with us from scalos if you ll excuse me shall be on the bridge
your quarters are quite like you captain austere and efficient and in their own way handsome
room should reflect its occupant
absolutely may freshen up all this rushing about has left me windblown glad to see you allow yourself some comforts are you married captain no family no attachments know you re married to your career and you never look at another woman
well if she pretty enough ll look
wondered when you say something nice to me am more presentable now
bit
it was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn see me but now
but now he kisses her then takes her hands but she dodges away he was trying to get the weapon from her sleeve
no wouldn allow you to take that no matter how much we trust each other but would ve been disappointed if you hadn tried
was too crude
just don try it again you re far too vulnerable to skin damage all have to do is scratch you
yes know
the difference between us is that you will come around to our way of thinking sooner or later but it better sooner than later another kiss
lieutenant will you replay the scalosian distress call on my viewer
aye sir of the planet scalos send you an urgent appeal for help my comrades and are the last surviving members of what was once thriving civilisation and then he just wasn there area we have no explanation for what happening to us spock slows down the playback then speeds it up those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area we have no explanation for what happening to us nation of nine hundred thousand city alone holding one hundred thirteen thousand on which existed several culturally enlightened indigenous population finally it is speeded up to the familiar buzz or whine the crew have been hearing apparent animal life mccoy discovers there is already computer tape in the machine slot he plays it and just hears that whine
mccoy to spock
ve found tape in the computer down here and when try to read it all get is whine life-support system produces an extreme numbing cold it is my belief that they are turning the enterprise into gigantic deep-freeze the unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact don know how to destroy it but its destruction is imperative will be too late
lieutenant uhura notify the rest of the crew
aye sir
can we use phasers to cut through that wall bypass the force field and get at that unit
mister scott we cannot cope with them on our level
can we find some way of coping with them on theirs
that is very logical suggestion stand by in the transporter room scott is in the doorway of the room as the scalosians try to fix the transporter
there nothing wrong elsewhere sir sufficient energy for beaming down
this is the only damage go get the others and bring them up here into comm deela deela deela kirk is putting on his boots as deela combs her hair draw your own conclusions rael runs in as the couple indulge in another kiss
rael rael takes swing at kirk
rael stop kirk uses chair as shield then deela shoots rael stun level twice
no
now stop it did he damage you captain
no
how very fortunate for you rael don you dare do anything like that again it contemptible
then don torment me you know how feel
don care what your feelings are don want to know that aspect of it what do is necessary and you have no right to question it allow me the dignity of liking the man select is the transporter repaired
no have more work to do
don you think you better do it rael leaves
he loves me adored him when was child suppose still do must say you behaved better than he did
yes hope so
what did you say
said hoped behaved correctly
and nothing bothers you now
why are we here
our leaving was delayed don you remember you damaged the transporter
oh yes that was wrong of me
yes it certainly was
but we are going to scalos
do you want to
oh yes
what about your crew aren you worried about them
they ll be all right
oh
what the matter
nothing you ve completely accepted the situation haven you you even like it
am behaving incorrectly
no liked you better before stubborn and irritating and independent like rael
those are undesirable qualities
maybe that why liked you so much because you were like him into comm rael you don have to worry about the captain he made the adjustment
finished
yes it counteracts the substance most effectively
most effectively under laboratory conditions but the question is will it work in the human body and the second question is how do we get it to the captain
by drinking the scalosian water and does so
spock you don know what that ll do to you
it is somewhat stimulating you seem to be moving very slowly doctor fascinating spock leaves and we jump back to normal time
he gone
just like compton the transporter is repaired and the three other scalosians are beamed down
ve beamed the others down
why didn you tell me
it would ve been an intrusion come up when you wish signal me when you are ready
where will you be
rael wait sorry
know kirk and deela walk past scott still in the doorway
well come captain it time to leave your pretty ship rael switches on the refrigerator unit
the unit is activated deela beam down at once
your crew will be all right you said so yourself kirk takes her weapon from her sleeve
sorry kirk leaves
into comm he broken away he armed rael; ready for him kirk meets spock in the corridor and they stand either side of the door rael fires once turns and kirk fires at him this time rael falls slowly to the floor then kirk destroys the unit deela arrives and all three enter the room properly
you are very clever captain you tricked me should ve known that you would never adjust what shall we expect from you now
we could put you in suspended animation until we determine what to do with you
your survival does not depend on that
no it doesn what do you want us to do with you
don make game of it captain we ve lost
if sent you to scalos you undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by
there won be any others you ll warn them your federation will quarantine the entire area
yes suppose it would
and we will die and solve your problem that way and ours scott is little further into the room
now what about your problem captain and your vulcan friend
if you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of scalos madam we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the enterprise
you could still find life on scalos very pleasant
and very brief
it ll be just as brief here you cannot get back to your own level no answer captain do displease you so much
oh no can think of nothing rather do than stay with you except staying alive deela joins rael on the transporter pad
energise
goodbye captain they are beamed away
well mister spock what have you got
doctor mccoy and have synthesised possible counteragent to the scalosian water regrettably we did not have the opportunity to test it
let test it drinks the contents of small vial nothing happening
you do seem to be moving very slowly captain
mister spock
captain kirk where the blazes did you come from
out of the nowhere into the here
and mister spock is he coming too
scotty captain log stardate 5710 mister spock has remained in accelerated time so that he might repair the ship more rapidly
somebody repairing every console on the ship
this panel is being recircuited at incredible speed
think we ve located mister spock lieutenant are your circuits clearing
yes sir
cancel red alert mister sulu
aye sir
open all channels captain to crew repairs are now being effected by mister spock the ship will resume normal operations almost immediately spock returns to normal time
mister spock my compliments to your repair work and yourself
thank you captain found it an accelerating experience
yes no malfunctions anywhere sees the scalosians on the viewscreen lieutenant
sorry sir touched the tape button accidentally ll take it off
that no malfunction
no sir
goodbye deela captain log stardate 5730 the planet ariannus is vital as transfer point on regular space commercial lanes it has been attacked by bacterial invasion which threatens to render it lifeless unless checked our mission to decontaminate it
mister chekov our estimated time of arrival for ariannus
at present speed our eta is three hours four minutes sir
lieutenant uhura advise the planet ministry of health that we ll begin decontamination procedures immediately upon locking into orbit
aye aye sir
scotty will that present any problems for you
none sir all tanks are being positioned
captain sensors indicate space vehicle of some sort ahead
is it within visual range
coming into range now sir it following very erratic course
put it on the screen extreme magnification wobbly shuttlecraft appears on the viewscreen
think that may be starfleet shuttlecraft
that is exactly what it is mister chekov
it looks like the one reported stolen from starbase four two weeks ago
lieutenant uhura try to contact them on command frequency two
aye captain no response sir
try all frequencies
aye sir hailing on all frequencies
captain there is one living creature aboard humanoid he is either injured or ill his craft shows internal atmospheric leakage the creature may be suffocating
lieutenant sulu activate tractor beams
tractor beams activated we have it sir
prepare to bring it aboard the hangar deck
aye sir
lieutenant uhura send security team to the pressure doors on the hangar deck
aye sir
mister spock come with me scotty scott takes the conn as we watch the shuttlecraft land we think it might say uss enterprise across it nose shuttlecraft approaching hangar deck
kirk here
acknowledged as the shuttlecraft turns around ncc 1701/7 is clearly emblazoned on it careless special effects
to security men we ll enter as soon as the doors open go on my command the doors open and man falls to the floor he is white on the right side and black on the left this is important mccoy gives the patient an injection
you are certain doctor that this pigmentation is the natural condition of this individual
that what ve recorded mister spock
do we have any knowledge of planet that could have produced such race of beings
negative captain
bones what do you make of it
well can give you any specific circumstance that will explain him
and judging by looking at him we know at the very least he is the result of very dramatic conflict spock
there is no theory captain from the basic work of mendel to recent nucleotide studies which would explain our captive all gradations of colour from black to brown to yellow to white are genetically predictable we must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity mutation one of kind
yes would agree that the case here
your prognosis doctor
well can give you one jim ve never worked on anyone like him or anything like him
yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were human
when in doubt the book prevails mister spock ve run tests blood is blood even when it green like yours the organs are there they re rearranged to degree plus few ve never seen before now ve enriched the oxygen content of his blood and pumped in strong stimulant and must say his recuperative powers appear to be excellent
with your permission captain shall do some further research and join you on the bridge spock leaves
he coming around doctor
well touch and go there for minute but you re out of danger now
you re aboard the starship enterprise
ve heard of it it in the united fleet of planets
federation so was the shuttlecraft that you were flying in
it was
don you usually know whose property you ve stolen
am not thief
well certainly no ordinary thief considering what it is you appropriated
you re being very loose with your accusations and drawing conclusions without any facts
well do know you made off with ship that didn belong to you
do not make off with things my need gave me the right to use the ship mark the word sir the use of it
you can try those technical evasions on starfleet command that where you ll be facing your charges
grateful for your rescue
don mention it we re pleased to have caught you who are you
my name is lokai
go on
from the planet cheron
that in the southernmost part of the galaxy in an uncharted quarter what are you doing so far from home no answer you understand that when we complete our mission we ll take you to starbase where you ll face very serious charge
the charge is trifling would ve returned the ship as soon as
had what what were you going to do
you monotone humans are all alike first you condemn and then attack will answer no more questions
well however we view him captain he certainly no ordinary specimen lokai don know what normal for you exactly but if had your readings be the most incredible physical specimen of all time
we ve never encountered being like you like to know more about you and your planet
very tired
and very evasive or at least not fully responsive now then
insist extremely tired made so by your vindictive cross-examinations will answer no more questions kirk goes to desk monitor
lieutenant uhura
notify starbase four that we ve recovered its shuttlecraft and it will be returned along with its user as soon as we ve completed our mission at ariannus
bones if you re satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable ll make note of it in my report
unless we get more information from him it ll have to serve intercom whistle
kirk here
ll be right there notify mister spock
put the ship on the viewing screen mister sulu magnification still nothing mister chekov
verify sir it out there
maximum magnification draw blank mister spock your response
negative captain
no malfunction sir the reading persists
what is it
there is vessel out there captain
could it be romulan ship using their cloaking device
negative this would not be romulan vessel it is totally alien in configuration motive power unknown small size of the craft indicates rapid scout vessel one or two-man crew
captain ve tried all hailing frequencies negative sir
weaponry on the vessel spock
nothing identifiable the craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat
something out there can be seen explanation
none completely elusive in fact it invisible
invisible malfunction
there is no sensor failure the readings persist
it headed straight for us
evasive action
it shifts with us sir and we re pushing to the limit
deflector shields activated mister sulu
automatic sir
we re on collision course
it out of control or suicide mission
sound warning for collision red alert
brace yourself for collision brace yourself nothing happens
read out mister spock
it just disintegrated fascinating
what is it now
it is gone now captain but it seems to have deposited an alien presence
where
right here captain by the turbolift doors is man white on the left side black on the right
explain spock one of kind
am bele
of the planet cheron no doubt
forgive my unorthodox arrival
your mode of travel was also unorthodox secure from red alert what happened to your vehicle
it served me long and durably unfortunately the strain of arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities was just able to complete this trip and disembark in time or would have disintegrated in space with it
most unique craft pity it couldn be salvaged for our study
yes it was sheathed in special materials that rendered it invisible
what brings you to us
you bear precious cargo lokai he has taken refuge aboard this ship am here to claim him
all personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command no one claims anyone without due process
my apologies captain overstepped my powers claim is undoubtedly an unfortunate word
what is your authorisation from what source
am chief officer of the commission on political traitors lokai was tried and convicted of treason but had escaped may see him please
he in sickbay remember since you re aboard the enterprise you re bound by its regulations
with your permission captain
mister spock
well lokai it pleasure to see you again this time sure our joining will be of more permanent nature captain you are to be congratulated never before has lokai been rendered so quiescent
will not return to cheron with him to land of murdering oppressors
told you where you were going allowed your fellow countryman here simply as courtesy
and you see how this killer repays you as he repays all his benefactors
benefactors he liar he raided our homes tore us from our families herded us together like cattle and then sold us as slaves
they were savages captain we took them into our hearts our homes we educated them
yes just education enough to serve the master race
you were the product of our love and you repaid us with murder
why should slave show mercy to the enslaver
slaves that was changed thousands of years ago you were freed
freed were we free to be men free to be husbands and fathers free to live our lives in equality and dignity
yes you were free if you knew how to use your freedom you were free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been built
tried to break the chains of hundred million people my only crime is that failed to that do plead guilty
there is an order in things he asked for utopia in day it can be done
not in day and not in ten times ten thousand years by your thinking to you we are loathsome breed who will never be ready genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia
you insane you filthy little plotter of ruin you vicious subverter of every decent thought oh you re coming back to pay for your crimes
know you and all those with whom you re plotting to take power permanently when return to cheron you will understand what power is will have armies of followers
it now very clear you know each other extremely well gentlemen the only service this ship can offer is to bring you together it is not battlefield
captain led revolutionaries not criminals demand political asylum this ship is sanctuary
ll tell you once more for you this ship is prison
captain it is imperative that you return lokai to cheron for judgment
commissioner cheron is not member of the federation no treaties have ever been signed your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured there are no extradition procedures to allow it is that clear commissioner bele
captain hope you will be sensible
how do you mean
co-operation
cannot take sides
since am without vessel to return to cheron insist that you take us there immediately
impossible have mission to accomplish there planet to be decontaminated millions of lives are at stake once that has been completed ll return to starbase four and turn you both over to the authorities you can make your case to them
am sorry captain that will not be satisfactory not at all satisfactory
commissioner as visiting dignitary from far planet offer you every hospitality aboard this ship choose any other course
you re the captain
yes am think we can consider your problem settled at least for the present have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six bele leaves with security escort
and suggest you get great deal of rest especially your vocal chords it seems you ll have double opportunity to practise your oratory on starbase four
kirk here
well get back on course itself
ll be right there
have you located the malfunction
no sir the ship is unresponsive we re moving away from ariannus
explanation mister spock
elusive captain am investigating
can understand it simply have no control
kirk to engineering
scotty we re suddenly off course check our manoeuvering controls
aye sir hold captain no malfunction indicated
aye sir out presses lot of buttons engineer to bridge
kirk here
stand by for check scotty we re still off course
speed mister chekov
we re moving at warp eight
and new course
four oh three mark seven straight for the coal sack if there is no letup
lieutenant uhura put the ship on red alert all hands this is the captain the ship is on red alert has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship directional control of our control as the guard heads off to his battle station lokai dashes out of sickbay scott enters
our new heading mister chekov
four oh three mark seven
spock
confirmed captain holding pattern co-ordinates now indicate we are charting course to pause captain cheron lies between four oh three mark seven and mark nine bele enters
we re on the way to cheron captain this ship is now under my direction for fifty thousand of your terrestrial years have been pursuing lokai through the galaxy have not travelled this far this long only to give him up this ship goes where my will drives it
captain we are now at warp ten and the speed is increasing lokai enters
captain course is now clearly straight for cheron despite all efforts to direct us to ariannus
will not return to cheron captain you must guarantee me sanctuary
he cannot help you now you are lost lokai you re on the way to judgment to final punishment
stop him
you evil mound of filth not this time
my cause is just you must help me all of you must help me
oh the old cry pity me pity me everywhere he gone he been helped to escape on every planet he found fools who bleed for him and shed tears for the oppressed one but there is no escape for you on this ship this is your last sanctuary
kill him kill him
you re two of kind
and we are both going to cheron you cannot change the course of this ship any more than you can change me this ship goes where want it to go
security put them both in the brig the security guards are held back by forcefields
phasers on stun fire no effect
your phasers are ineffective against our shields you are helpless captain
what fool am expecting help from someone like you
this ship is going to ariannus
no this ship is going to cheron will let nothing interfere
we are going to ariannus the lives of billion people make no other choice possible
you are being obtuse captain am permitting no choice my will now controls this and nothing can break it
bele am captain of this ship and it will follow whatever course set for it or will order its destruction
you re bluffing
will destroy it
you can no more destroy this ship than can change colour
lieutenant uhura tie in the bridge to the master computer
aye sir
computer destruct sequence are you ready to copy
working
prepare to verify destruct sequence code one computer this is captain james kirk of the uss enterprise destruct sequence one code one one computer voice and code one one verified and correct sequence one complete

mister spock is this ship headed for ariannus
negative captain the enterprise is now moving in circular course
and at warp ten we re going now here mighty fast
warned you of his treachery kill him
we re waiting for you to fulfil your commitment commissioner
captain am happy to have you complete your mission of mercy to the planet ariannus it was madness to interfere with such worthwhile endeavour but if you will upon completion please take me and my traitorous captive to cheron
make no deals for control of this ship sir
the ship course is now in your control
ship course
enterprise is now on course to ariannus captain
speed scotty
warp six and smoothly operating sir
good lieutenant uhura cancel red alert
aye sir
let me reaffirm my position gentlemen could put you in the brig for what you have done but won do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy which is governed by the united federation of planets we live in peace with full exercise of individual rights the need to resort to violence and force has long since passed and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship you are free to move about the ship hope that you ll take the opportunity to know more about the federation through its best representatives my crew but let me make it clear will stand for no interference with the function of this ship all hands return to normal routine captain out bele leaves with an escort
you speak very well captain your words promise justice for all
we try sir
yes well have learned to wait for actions after ariannus what is justice shall wait to see it dispensed lokai leaves
fascinating two irrevocably hostile humanoids
disgusting is what call them
that description is not scientifically accurate
mister spock the word disgusting describes exactly what feel about those two
that enough for today those two are beginning to affect you crew are sitting at tables not playing chess while lokai expounds his case spock and we are listening from outside
and know from my actions you must all think me volcanic hothead erupting lava from my nostrils at danger signals that are only figments of my imagination but believe me my friends there can be no moment when can have my guard down where such as bele is present so what happens act the madman out of the anger and frustration he forces upon me and thereby prove his point that am madman
no one knows how he ll react under pressure lokai
after all we are only human
ah mister chekov therein lies my lack of ability to alert you and your captain to the real threat of someone like bele you see you are from the planet earth there is no persecution on your planet how can you understand my fear my apprehension my degradation my suffering
there was persecution on earth once remember reading about it in my history class
yes but it happened way back in the twentieth century there no such primitive thinking today
you have read about it in history see how can make your flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you and only because they are like you despised slaughtered and even worse denied the simplest bit of decency that is living being right do you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel into war on another planet battle that will serve your oppressor and bring death to you and your brothers
putting the matter into the hands of your starfleet command is of course the proper procedure how long will it be before we hear from them captain
expect the answer is already on its way
well then let us drink to their wise solution to our problem
let do that
commissioner starfleet command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate there is the matter of the shuttlecraft which lokai appropriated the interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to starfleet
gentlemen we are discussing question of degree surely stealing shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of murdering thousands of people
we do not know that lokai has done that
one thing we are agreed on is that lokai is criminal
no commissioner the one thing we re agreed upon is that lokai took shuttlecraft intercom whistle
excuse me
kirk here
yes read it
starfleet command extends greetings to commissioner bele of the planet cheron his urgent request to be transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been taken under consideration honour that request intergalactic treaty clearly specifies that no being can be extradited without due process in view of the circumstances we have no doubt that after hearing at starbase commissioner bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner and be provided transportation
that enough thank you
as always lokai has managed to gain allies
now wait minute commissioner
even if they don recognise themselves as being such yes he will evade delay and escape again and in the process put thousands of innocent beings at each other throats getting them to kill and maim for cause which they have no stake in but which he will force them to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies his loathsome accusations and his foul threats
can assure you commissioner that our minds will not be twisted not by lokai nor by you
it is obvious to the most simpleminded that lokai is of an inferior breed
the obvious visual evidence commissioner is that he is of the same breed as yourself
are you blind commander spock well look at me look at me
you re black on one side and white on the other
am black on the right side
fail to see the significant difference
lokai is white on the right side all of his people are white on the right side
commissioner perhaps the experience of my own planet vulcan may set an example of some value to you vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy cheron we were once people like yourselves wildly emotional often committed to irrationally opposing points of view leading of course to death and destruction only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction
commander spock am delighted that vulcan was saved but you cannot expect lokai and people like him to act with self-discipline any more than you can expect planet to stop orbiting its sun
let lokai state his grievances hear him listen to him maybe he can change maybe he wants to change his image
he cannot change
change is the essential process of all existence for instance the people of cheron must have once been mono-coloured
you mean like both of you
there must have been time long ago no doubt when that was true intercom whistle
excuse me kirk here
very good commence decontamination procedures when ready advise when complete
once heard that on some of your planets people believe they are descended from apes
the actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages
ready for decontamination procedure
ready sir
ready here
ready mister scott
mister sulu lock into co-ordinates requested by ariannus
locked in sir
mister chekov position tanks for spray release
tanks positioned
lieutenant uhura advise ariannus the mission is to begin on signal all ground precautions must be ready
ariannus says go ahead
well let er rip the planet they are orbiting turns orange then white and blue
scott to captain kirk
first run complete sir
good repeat procedure for maximum effect
aye sir ready to repeat decontamination procedure
ready sir
mister sulu
ready here this time the oceans and land masses are very clearly seen not cloud in the sky
we re completing the final orbit of ariannus sir awaiting instructions to set course for the next destination
very good we ll be right up
set directional controls for starbase four kirk out will you join us on the bridge
there is nothing would like more captain log stardate 5730 having completed our mission to ariannus the enterprise is now on course to starbase four the crew is on normal routine and we are proceeding without incident chekov is hunched over spock station
trouble mister chekov
don rightly know mister spock was trying to programme for starbase four as ordered can get response
it just seemed to go dead sir
captain some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out
can you determine which ones
the directional control and the self-destruct captain are both burnt out did it like this bele waves his hands over the computer controls and they flash in electrical short-circuits captain log stardate 5730 in deliberate act of sabotage commissioner bele has burned out our destruct mechanism and through the power of his will has again taken over directional control of the enterprise lokai enters
now can we go to cheron without any more discussion
at the moment seem to have no choice
so this is justice after ariannus you have signed my death warrant warned you what to expect will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on if you are partisans of justice prove it kill him
we are not killers
what do you do carry justice on your tongues you will beg for it but you won fight or die for it
after so many years of leading the fight you seem very much alive
doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers
you re finished lokai we ve got your kind penned in on cheron into little districts and it not going to change you ve combed the galaxy and come up with nothing but mono-coloured trash do-gooders and bleeding hearts you re dead you half-white
you useless pieces of bland flesh ll take you with me you half-black they lunge for each others throats and send off electrical charges
bele you keep this up and you ll never get to cheron with your prisoner the rest of this ship will be irreparably damaged this will be your final battlefield your fifty thousand years of pursuit will have been wasted bele and lokai separate
and you lokai will die here in space you ll inspire no more disciples your cause will be ended
remember captain political sanctuary is my right am your prisoner honour that right or the fight will go on and your ship will burn up
you ve made your point
if you listen to his legalistic trickery shall have to destroy this ship and everybody aboard
understand will you return the enterprise to my control
why not
scotty have repairs on directional control been completed
aye sir re-routed
check controls and co-ordinates
controls operating the enterprise is responding as always captain it beautiful
locking onto co-ordinates
captain we are within scanning range of cheron
is it within visual range
coming within visual range now captain
chekov put it on the screen extreme magnification what are you picking up
several large cities uninhabited extensive traffic systems barren of traffic lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities no sapient life-forms registering at all captain there is no evidence of natural disaster yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities
you mean all the people are dead
all dead captain they have annihilated each other totally
my people all dead
yes commissioner all of them
no one alive
none at all sir
your band of murderers did this
your genocidal maniacs did this they attack each other again
stop it what the matter with you two didn you hear spock your planet is dead there nobody alive on cheron because of hate the cause you fought about no longer exists give yourselves time to breathe give up your hate you re welcome to live with us listen to me you both must end up dead if you don stop hating
you re an idealistic dreamer lokai leaves
bele the chase is finished
he must not escape me
where can he go bele leaves
bele
shall alert security sir
no lieutenant where can they run through the ship knocking over crewmen whilst imagining the buildings burning on their home planet
captain have located them on ship sensors bele is chasing lokai on deck three bele is passing recreation room three approaching the crewmen lounge lokai is running past the crewmen lounge lokai has just arrived on deck five passing recreation room three lokai beams himself away
captain someone has activated the transporter mechanism
spock anyone in the transporter room
negative captain transporter room is clear however there is life-form materialising on the planet it is lokai he is back on cheron
there nobody there to try him his judges are all dead
captain the transporter mechanism has been activated again
of course
it is bele captain and another life-form has appeared on cheron
it doesn make any sense
to expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical
but their planet dead does it matter now which one right
not to lokai and bele all that matters to them is their hate
do you suppose that all they ever had sir
no but that all they have left warp factor two mister sulu set course for starbase four captain log stardate 5693 the enterprise is approaching the last reported position of the star ship defiant which vanished without trace three weeks ago we are in unsurveyed territory you could cut the tense atmosphere with knife
captain we are registering very curious readings from all sensors
specify
cannot according to our instruments space itself is literally breaking up there is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings
what about sensor failure
negative have run complete check on all systems
captain we re losing power in the warp engines
how bad is it
we can barely read it but don like the looks of it and cannot find out the cause
captain visual detection of an object dead ahead
how about it spock
fascinating
explain
there is virtually no sensor contact no mass analysis no trace of radiation we see it but our sensors indicate it is not there as they close in the bright fuzzy thing on the screen becomes recognizable
the defiant mister sulu impulse engines only close to transporter range
aye aye sir
lieutenant open up hailing frequency
ve been trying to raise them sir there is no response
just within transporter range sir
good maintain position mister spock mister chekov come with me doctor mccoy report to the transporter room immediately scotty you have the conn
aye sir the landing party are wearing silvery space suits
locked in on the defiant bridge sir
energise the crew are dead one man is in the act of strangling another
has there ever been mutiny on starship before
absolutely no record of such an occurrence ensign
jim the captain neck is broken
the ship is still functioning captain it is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard
use the ship sensors to locate them kirk to enterprise
prepare to beam over full security squad on my orders
captain there is no sign of life aboard this vessel
odd mister spock very odd spock you stay here with me chekov get down to engineering and life support systems doctor mccoy check out the sickbay kirk to enterprise cancel the security squad and stand by for further instructions
aye aye captain standing by
can get an accurate fix on the defiant mister scott but know it drifting away from us shall correct for range sir
aye think you re right keep us within beaming range but not too close the crew in engineering are dead so is everyone in sickbay the patients were strapped down onto the beds
captain
just like what found in life support all dead
get back up here chekov has dizzy spell and totters out of engineering
kirk to mccoy
mccoy here
bones can you tell me what they all died of
they what
you heard correctly jim these people killed each other
could mental disease have infected all of the crew didn even know what was going on
the best can do is get all the readings can get and analyse them later mccoy kneels beside slightly fuzzy crewman lying on the floor and reaches out to touch him his hand passes through the body
what the devil
bones what is it answer me mccoy hand passes through padd and desk
answer me
jim this ship is dissolving my hand just passed through man
get up here on the double on the viewscreen the fuzzy defiant disappears and reappears several times
mister scott the defiant it starting to disappear
transporter room neil here
no sir not yet
take over mister sulu ll be in the transporter room
aye aye sir
captain the defiant sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the enterprise
you mean what happened to the defiant might be happening to the enterprise
affirmative
kirk to enterprise mister scott
mister scott stand by to beam us back
can sir at least not all at once
why not what happened
everything that ship you re in is fading out and it ripping the innards out of this one frequencies ve only got three of them working and not sure of those one of you has got to wait
chekov mccoy prepare for transportation you too spock
request permission to remain captain could be completing the data
request denied
captain there is chance
know what the chances are mister spock don argue get back with the information ll be right there scotty energise transporter
aye it takes two goes and lot of switch flicking to beam the three onto the enterprise
energise nothing happens chekov switches on the wall monitor
it gone the defiant just vanished scott and neil start fiddling with the innards of the transporter console
anything
negative
that it ve done all can there nothing out there to grab hold of and bring in when that ship went it must have taken the captain with it
computer working
compute the next period of spatial interphase
next interphase two hours twelve minutes
two hours and twelve minutes that power leak has unbalanced the ship and she starting to drift can hold her in place that long
we must try mister scott the fabric of space is very weak here if we disturb it there will be no chance of retrieving the captain alive
don understand what so special about this region of space
well picture it this way mister chekov we exist in universe which co-exists with multitude of others in the same physical space at certain brief periods of time an area of their space overlaps an area of ours that is time of interphase during which we can connect with the defiant universe
mister spock we will be able to retrieve the captain at that time won we
yes however the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar any use of power disturbs it if we are not extremely careful we shall lose the captain and become trapped ourselves
see
and die like him chekov leaps up pushes spock away and screaming attacks sulu scott grabs him and mccoy arrives to help spock grabs his face
chekov chekov spock neck-pinches him into silence
security guards to the bridge
aye sir
what happened mister spock
was attempting to explain to mister chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked
did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this
think he had several spasms of pain
did he seem to be getting hysterical
doctor he seemed more angry than frightened
he had no cause to be angry security arrive
take mister chekov to sickbay put him under restraint scott and the security guards leave with chekov
lieutenant uhura is correct there was murderous fury in chekov the same fury which was evident in the defiant
that what was afraid of whatever it was that drove the crew of the defiant to murder each other could be communicable
is there anything you need to isolate the cause
time by the way mister spock think it might be wise precaution to put some distance between us and the defiant
if we are to recover the captain we must not move
how long will that take
approximately two hours before the attempt can be made
spock are you sure that jim is still alive
the captain was caught in our transporter beam when the defiant phased out it is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived however if we are to recover him we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase or he will die and there can be no margin for error his environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours
mister spock vessel approaching on an intercept vector
status mister sulu
range two hundred thousand kilometres velocity zero point five one an arrow-head shaped ship has arrived
lieutenant uhura signal red alert
aye sir red alert all decks go to red alert
they ve stopped dead sir range ninety thousand kilometres and holding
mister spock receiving visual signal
transfer to main viewer
aye sir strange garish orange figure with triangular eyes possibly appears against blue and pink tie-die background territorial annex of the tholian assembly you must leave this area immediately
spock in command of the federation star ship enterprise commander according to the federation this area is free space use force if necessary to protect our property
we are not interested in your display of force the enterprise is responding to distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations do you wish to assist us instruments indicate ours are the only two vessels in this area
the other ship is interspatially trapped it should reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes we request you stand by until then interstellar amity we will wait precisely one hour and fifty three minutes but be correct we do not tolerate deceit bench full of bottles and red stuff dribbling through curvy pipes
if we could only find the proper filtering agent we might be able to solve this problem negative it the third failure the lab assistant is starting to go like chekov
nurse take this sample and run an analysis on it
yes doctor
bridge to transporter room
transporter room here chapel turns to see the lab assistant about to strike mccoy with metal bar
doctor mccoy the two men struggle while chapel prepares hypo and knocks the attacker out
thank you nurse call security want to have some checks run on this man
lock on to captain kirk co-ordinates scott the transporter activates but nothing happens
trying captain kirk is not on his designated co-ordinates mister spock
lieutenant sulu evaluation
sensor readings are not corresponding to those we received the last time we saw the defiant
it possible the tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space and if that has occurred
spock here
has the captain been beamed aboard yet
when is that interphase going to happen
theoretically it already has happened doctor responding as predicted
thought you had the thing timed out
did doctor the space was disturbed by the tholians
you mean you don know whether you re going to be able to recover the captain or not
shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur they do not take place at regular intervals
you can wait for the next one we ve had another case like chekov
have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause doctor and prevent further spread of the affliction
the disease is not transmitted by the men mister spock the cause is the area of space we re in it affecting the whole crew tissues in the central nervous system are distorting
and the madness that affected the defiant crew will soon happen to the enterprise here
mister spock we re being fired upon the ship shakes to the impact of the blasts of energy
the renowned tholian punctuality
mister spock damage control report minor structural damage to sections a4 and c13
engineering hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures mister sulu divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields
but sir that ll reduce our phaser power by fifty percent
mister spock another bolt of energy is heading towards them
scott to bridge
spock here do something about that ship out there mccoy enters
understood lieutenant uhura open channel to the tholian ship mister sulu lock in phaser tracking controls
phasers locked in sir
there no response on any frequency sir
what the use of this battle spock you ve lost jim take this ship out of here
ready mister sulu
ready mister spock
fire
hit mister spock
engineering status report mister scott supply converters
can do thing with the enterprise now through that doorway out there
can you estimate minimum time required for repair
don even know if she can be repaired
are you satisfied spock why did you do it
the decision to fight was logical lack of time prevented any other course of action the tholian ship had to be disabled
you should ve known what could ve happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew that is the mark of starship captain like jim
doctor hardly believe this is the time for comparisons please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects of this space that is your primary task since we must remain here mccoy leaves
mister spock something has just entered sensor range it another tholian sir loskene must ve contacted them when he tried to intercept us
fascinating
shall lock in remaining phaser power sir
negative lieutenant uhura can you open channel to the approaching vessel
they re refusing reception can
distance mister sulu
just beyond phaser range sir
what is that the two tholian ships have joined stern to stern and are now moving apart drawing thread of some sort out between them then they come back across the viewscreen creating two more lines
mister sulu shall run an analysis on those filaments tie in all sensors to the ship library computer console switch scanners
yes sir five horizontal lines on the viewscreen
there no analogy to this structure in federation technology it is however an energy field and if the tholians are successful in completing this structure before we have completed our repairs we shall not see home again now the tholians are adding diagonal lines to the web spock stands on raised platform behind lectern crew and officers are filing in
doctor your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative
it still negative mister spock theragen is the most promising substance tested so far we re progressing
the urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory
my staff is working around the clock my being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests this service requires my personal attention mister spock he sits next to scott
few hours ago the captain elected to remain on board the defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the enterprise his concern was not only for them but for all the members of the crew of this ship you all know the sequence of events we were fired upon by the tholian ship at that time captain kirk may have been alive deemed it necessary to return the tholian fire for the safety of the enterprise the tholian ship has been disabled but as result of the battle we must accept the fact that captain kirk is no longer alive crewman goes berserk and is carried out by three security men
take him to sickbay put him in restraint
shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which captain kirk commanded each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts
attention respectful pause dismissed everyone starts to file out
there is duty to be performed in the captain quarters which requires our presence
it can wait doctor my duties require my immediate presence on the bridge
the captain left message tape it was his order that it be reviewed by both of us should he ever be declared dead you have just declared jim dead
it will wait for more suitable moment doctor
why are you afraid it ll change your present status
the mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility doctor at the moment they are your top priority
the captain last order is top priority and you will honour that order before you take over
looking at medal he was hero in every sense of the word yet his life was sacrificed for nothing the one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the enterprise now you ve made that impossible mister spock
we came here for specific purpose doctor
maybe not the same one really came here to find out why you stayed and fought
the captain would have remained to recover crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship
yes he would mister spock but you didn have that decision to make what would you gain by fighting the tholians you could have assured yourself of captaincy by leaving the area but you chose to stay why
need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew there is margin of variation in any experiment while there was chance was bound legally and morally to ascertain the captain status
you mean to be sure if he was dead well you made certain of that
that is enough doctor we both have other things to do
yes have something to do if this crew is to survive have to find an antidote to this space you ve locked us into
you will return to your duty as soon as we ve discharged our responsibilities here
there no hurry mister spock the antidote probably doesn concern you vulcans are probably immune so just take your time spock enters the combination to the captain safe
must admit don understand you spock but just can believe that you would want jim command you must know that if you get us out of this situation they ll pin medal on your chest and give you command of the enterprise
doctor am in command of the enterprise
would like to remedy that situation
if you believe have acted irregularly then relieve me of duty that is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship will assume that am dead that the tactical situation is critical and both of you are locked in mortal combat it means spock that you have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career can offer only one small piece of advice for whatever it worth use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship but temper your judgment with intuitive insight believe you have those qualities but if you can find them in yourself seek out mccoy ask his advice and if you find it sound take it bones you ve heard what ve just told spock help him if you can but remember he is the captain his decisions must be followed without question you might find that he is capable of human insight and human error they are most difficult to defend but you will find that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence each of you have given me take care
spock er sorry it does hurt doesn it
what would you have me say doctor the intercom whistles
spock here field think we can estimate its approximate completion time
shall be there shortly doctor believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the tholians complete theirs uhura is obviously off-duty as she has changed out of her uniform she is just putting on necklace when she is hit by searing pain in her body then she catches sight of ghostly image in the mirror
captain captain kirk we thought you were but the image fades away she dashes out
spock mister oh doctor ve just seen the captain
of course you have uhura we would all like to
he alive he alive doctor
of course
believe me did see him did spock mister spock
we re going to sickbay
doctor doctor not going mad did see captain kirk ve got to get to mister spock she faints in his arms an engineer succumbs to space-madness and attacks scott two others haul him off
scott to captain
spock here proceed mister scott
one of our crewmen just went berserk but we have him under control for the moment
report to doctor mccoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack we can hear chekov cries as he struggles against the restraints in sickbay
doctor mccoy
yes nurse
have the diagnosis of the crewman who attacked engineer scott it was definitely due to the deteriorative effects of interspace
yes it beginning to spread generally throughout the ship
are we any closer doctor
no except positive that it theragen derivative that the answer and it better be the next one the web is getting close to completion all around the enterprise whilst chekov writhes against invisible foes uhura lies quietly on the bed
mister spock didn believe me either did he doctor
well nobody saw him but you uhura
then didn really see him did
don think so
will become like chekov doctor
no no we re working hard we ll find an antidote neil has dizzy spell
we re beginning to interphase
all right
scott to bridge
are we slipping into interspace
negative we are relatively stable at the moment scott sees ghostly image floating by the ladders to the upper level it kirk
don believe it then it is gone mccoy enters
mister scott
ve just seen captain kirk he was standing there as plain as we are
report to the bridge immediately
sounds like horror story suppose there any truth in it
in critical moments men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see
do you suppose they re seeing jim because they ve lost confidence in you
was merely stating fact doctor
it getting critical there have been number of assaults down on the lower decks even scotty being affected if scotty goes under that the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the enterprise out of here
please leave that to me doctor mccoy realise that the crew are your prime concern you can best serve them in your laboratory urge you to confine yourself to it until remedy has been found
spock it must be this space it getting to me too know it nothing you ve done spock sorry
understand doctor sure the captain would simply have said forget it bones mccoy collapses as scott enters
mister spock look the image of kirk is there apparently calling out to them
captain captain captain the image disappears mccoy releases the straps on uhura bed
am all right doctor
yes uhura you re fine
then what saw
it was real
captain kirk alive
we all saw him the captain still alive
mccoy here
results of the last theragen test are ready for you doctor
ll be right there
then your fears about that phaser were correct it blasted hole right through that crazy space fabric and only heaven knows where it sent the defiant
exactly but the captain remained only the overlap time changed the next interphase will occur here diagram on desk monitor
can you be ready
that ll be about twenty minutes aye she ll be back together but we ll only have about eighty percent power built up
it will have to do mister scott door buzzer come mccoy enters carrying tray with flask of orange liquid and three shot glasses
what have you got there
compliments of the house to your good health and the health of the crew
you ve found the antidote doctor
yes and ve ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship would like for you gentlemen to drink it down
ensign chekov was affected so early has he responded to it
he his smiling self again ve discharged him from sickbay
what is it
it diluted theragen derivative
theragen nerve gas used by the klingons
aye and deadly too what are you thinking of doc are you trying to kill us all
if remember correctly it caused fatality only when used in pure form
that right and in this derivative mixed with alcohol it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain
oh well any decent brand of scotch will do that
one good slug of this and you can hit man with phaser stun and he never feel it or even know it
does it make good mix with scotch
it should
ll let you know leaves with the remaining contents of the flask
well drink it down spock it the human thing to do that medical order captain
welcome back lieutenant
thank you sir
your absence was keenly felt mister chekov
thank you mister spock
estimated time for completion of the tholian web
two minutes sir
are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace
yes sir the ship can drive into interspace at any time
spock to engineering
scott here
fifteen seconds
mister spock they re closing the web
interphase in ten seconds nine eight chapel and mccoy enter
stand by with full power
she only up to seventy six percent
it will have to do
one
ready to transport on my order kirk appears on the viewscreen
see him
there he is
it the captain sir the tractor field is activating
we re being pulled out of here
try to maintain position mister sulu
can sir
engineering bring ship power up to full capability there massive jolt then the enterprise disappears from inside the web and reappears in open space
where are we now mister spock
captain we have destroyed the tholians web
negative ensign utilising ship power has thrown us clear of it compute the distance from the original location
at once sir
have we lost the captain
we shall soon see lieutenant
the ship has been thrown exactly two point seven two parsecs distant from our previous position
good since the captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area he should ve been drawn here with us spock to transporter room
mccoy here standing by with hypo of tri-ox compound for him
ready mister spock
prepare to transport on the captain co-ordinates on my order kirk appears on the viewscreen again
mister spock it him it the captain
see him ensign see him now doctor it takes couple of attempts but kirk is beamed safely aboard and promptly falls to his knees mccoy injects him while chapel removes his helmet
bones
welcome home jim
had whole universe to myself after the defiant was thrown out there was absolutely no one else in it must say prefer crowded universe much better how did you two get along without me
oh we managed mister spock gave the orders and found the answers
good no problems between you
none worth reporting captain
try me
only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved
which humans mister spock
he means when humans become involved with vulcans jim
ah yes understand well hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don feel worth reporting
orders captain
what orders are you referring to jim
my last orders the last orders that left for both of you the last taped orders
oh those orders well there wasn time we never had chance to listen to them
no you see the crisis was upon us and then passed so quickly captain that we
good good well hope we won have similar opportunities to test those orders which you never heard ahead warp factor two mister sulu
warp factor two sir
all observation stations take final readings this ll be our last orbit
spock any answers
still read suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface captain
which is scientifically impossible under conditions there
agreed mister sulu switch to the planet area have under observation
reading it now mister spock it seems to indicate artificial power being generated in factor seven quantities
which would indicate considerable civilisation there
what all this poppycock about life forms on this planet spock the surface is molten lava the atmosphere is poisonous
our readings could be false captain perhaps caused by some natural phenomena
well think starfleet should forget about those old space legends there no intelligent life here
lieutenant anything from the planet
ve repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency sir there no response on any channel
transmit to starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate further we are therefore going on to our next assignment
aye aye sir
completing final orbit sir
prepare to warp us out the red light on the navigation console flashes and the lights dim
alert status
we re being scanned captain deep probe incredibly swift the lights come back up and the planet disappears from the viewscreen
jim on the screen is the image of man sitting in large leather chair and wearing stove-pipe hat your acquaintance sir
uhura do gather that you recognise me
recognise what you appear to be in this case james kirk am abraham lincoln
spock
fascinating spock but never with that word
was requesting your analysis spock
they did scan us and our vessel captain and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion aboard your vessel no doubt you have devices which can check my reality
we be honoured to have you aboard mister president
we can convert to it sir in there exactly twelve and one half minutes until then captain and the orange planet is back in view
signing padd thank you mister mulney
small change occurring there captain
magnification four helm
aye aye sir
an area of approximately one thousand square kilometres it measures completely earth-like
perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere
he called it to the second sir we ll be over it in exactly twelve minutes now
security send detachment to the transporter room immediately phaser side arms and be prepared to give presidential honours
jim do you really believe he abraham lincoln
it obvious he believes it doctor mccoy mister spock full dress uniforms scott is in kilt and plaid the three security guards look smart
full dress presidential honours what is this nonsense mister dickerson
understand president lincoln coming aboard sir
ha you re daft man
all know is what the captain tells me and he says he ll have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles mccoy enters
have expected sanity from the ship surgeon at least president lincoln indeed no doubt to be followed by louis of france and robert the bruce kirk and spock enter
if so we ll execute appropriate honours to each mister scott
aye sir
gentlemen don for moment believe that president lincoln is actually coming aboard but we re dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life-form until we know when in rome we ll do as the romans do position
locked on to something does that appear human to you mister spock
fascinating for moment it appeared almost mineral like living rock with heavy fore claws it settling down now to completely human readings
we can beam it aboard anytime now sir
doctor mccoy take tricorder readings and see if it is human appropriate ruffles and flourishes mister spock security stand ready
phaser team set ready for heavy stun
band honours ready captain
energise tall lean figure in black frock coat is beamed aboard to drum beat and bosun whistle
the uss enterprise is honoured to have you aboard mister president
strange where are the musicians
that taped music sir starship on active duty never carries an honour detachment
taped music you say well perhaps mister spock will be good enough to explain that to me later most interesting way to come aboard captain what was the device used
an energy-matter scrambler sir the molecules in your body are converted into energy then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern
well since obviously here and quite whole whatever you mean apparently works very well indeed gentlemen if those are weapons please lower them at my age afraid not very dangerous
human jim
all too human doctor mccoy happy to make your acquaintance
mister president may present my officers commander spock second in command engineering officer scott and security officer dickerson
mister spock mister scott mister dickerson gentlemen hope to talk to each of you but meanwhile your captain is consumed with questions and shall do my utmost to answer them and trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine at your service captain
lieutenant dickerson you and your men may return to quarters mister president
most interesting vessel kirk lincoln spock and security leave
just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard
you heard mister spock yourself mineral he called it like living rock
and that became lincoln
couldn tell it may have been another figure down there standing by what do you make of it
not quite sure captain log stardate 5906 who or what has been beamed aboard our vessel an alien who has changed himself into this form an illusion cannot conceive it possible that abraham lincoln could have actually been reincarnated and yet his kindness his gentle wisdom his humour everything about him is so right
yes if recall your union army observation balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high we re six hundred and forty three miles above the surface of this planet
you can measure great distances that closely
we do sir six hundred forty three miles two thousand twenty one feet two point zero four inches at this moment using your old-style measurements
bless me
excuse me captain kirk
yes lieutenant
mister scott
what charming negress oh forgive me my dear know in my time some used that term as description of property
but why should object to that term sir you see in our century we ve learned not to fear words
may present our communications officer lieutenant uhura
the foolishness of my century had me apologising where no offense was given
we ve each learned to be delighted with what we are the vulcans learned that centuries before we did
it is basic to the vulcan philosophy sir the combination of number of things to make existence worthwhile
yes philosophy of nome meaning all how did know that just as seem to know that on the planet surface you will meet one of the greatest living vulcans in all the long history of your planet my mind cannot recall his name but know he will be there what is it that powers your vessel captain may see your engine room
certainly our engineering officer
has been waiting in the briefing room for you sir for over two hours
oh dear if you ll forgive me our communications officer
would be delighted to have her as guide
forgive me again we ll rejoin you shortly
where the devil are they
why they re probably looking up plate of haggis in the galley they ve been everywhere else kirk and spock enter
sorry to have been delayed gentlemen
jim would be the last to advise you on your command image
doubt that bones but continue
do have to lay it out for you practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can possibly be the real article
lincoln died three centuries ago on planet hundreds of light years away
more that direction engineer
you re the science officer why aren you well doing whatever science officer does at time like this
am doctor am observing the alien
at last at least somebody agrees with us he an alien
yes of course he an alien mccoy and he potentially dangerous
mad loony as an arcturian dogbird
gentlemen as you know mister spock and have been invited to beam down to the planet surface with him any comments on that
yes big one suddenly miraculously we see small spot of earth-type environment down there now is it really there or do we just think we see it down there
you might beam down into sea of molten lava
but why would he want to kill only two of us
it would be illogical with such abilities they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel
are you implying mister spock that it probably safe to beam down there
no not doctor there no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose otherwise they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this
why lincoln spock any speculation on that
speculation is unnecessary captain the answer is clear president lincoln has always been very personal hero to you what better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for you
but not only to me spock
agreed too experienced his charm it is magnificent work of duplication
but he holds special involvement to you jim think it interesting in as much as you re the one who going to make the decision whether to beam down or not
don do it captain
the very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life although the method is beyond our comprehension we have been offered contact therefore shall beam down mister spock as for you
captain since was included in the invitation to make contact must beam down with you
you re both out of your heads
aye sir
and you re on the edge of insubordination
would be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that might not be able to patch together again
aye
gentlemen your concern is noted and appreciated mister spock standard dress tricorders and phasers we will guide president lincoln to the transporter room we ll beam down immediately
standing by mister scott
transporter room to bridge standing by sensors continue to show the area as completely earth-like in all respects
if they re wrong and they do beam into pool of lava
then they re dead men couldna pull them back in time
all right mister scott energise lincoln kirk and spock are beamed away but
scotty sandy ground big rocks orange sky
captain our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us
kirk to enterprise enterprise enterprise come in kirk to enterprise enterprise come in
undamaged yet something is preventing them from functioning
come in landing party report enterprise to captain kirk can you read us
if they re all right they should ve reported in
your explanation sir
well have none to me this seems quite as it should be
why were our weapons taken why can we communicate with our ship
please believe me know nothing other than what have already told you
the game is over we ve treated you with courtesy we ve gone along with what and who you think you are
despite the seeming contradictions all is as it appears to be am abraham lincoln
just as am whom appear to be
surak
who
the greatest of all who ever lived on our planet captain the father of all we became
in the captain chair all ship systems going dead switch to reserve power all decks report status
all decks report status all decks report status
bridge to engineering come in what happening to our power bridge to engineering report all power in the warp engines scott and mccoy enter
how is it mister sulu
no answer yet on what caused it they re standing by
shut down all but the most necessary systems
no damage report mister scott
engage restart cycle
start emergency procedures
live long and prosper spock may you also captain kirk
it is not logical that you are surak there is no fact extrapolation of fact or theory which would make possible
whatever am would it harm you to give response
live long and prosper image of surak father of all we now hold true
the image of surak read in your face what is in your mind spock
as turned and my eyes beheld you displayed emotion beg forgiveness
the cause was more than sufficient let us speak no further of it in my time we knew not of earth men am pleased to see that we have differences may we together become greater than the sum of both of us
spock we ll not go along with these charades any longer rock changes into creature with heavy fore-claws
you ll have an answer soon captain our world is called excalbia countless who live on that planet are watching before this drama unfolds we give welcome to the ones named kirk and spock
we know nothing of your world or your customs what do you mean drama about to unfold
you re intelligent life form but surprised you do not perceive the honour we do you have we not created in this place on our planet stage identical to your own world
we perceive we were invited to come here and we came in friendship and you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world to defend ourselves to communicate with our vessel
your objection is well taken we shall communicate with your vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the play behold more people arrive human mongol an alien woman and klingon
captain mister spock some of these you may know through history genghis khan for one and colonel green who led genocidal war early in the 21st century on earth zora who experimented with the body chemistry of subject tribes on tiburon kahless the unforgettable the klingon who set the pattern for his planet tyrannies we welcome the vessel enterprise our spectacle
at least the captain and spock are safe
it confrontation of some sort those are all figures out of history notoriously evil
the confrontation of the two opposing philosophies you term good and evil since this is our first experiment with earthlings our theme is simple one survival life and death your philosophies are alien to us and we wish to understand them and discover which is the stronger we learn by observing such spectacles
what do you mean survival
the word is explicit if you and spock survive you return to your vessel if you do not your existence is ended
can we beam the captain and spock back up
we don have the power they ll come aboard mass of dying flesh
well can we send the phasers down
there nothing we can do doctor nothing but watch them he skimmed the worst ones in history to face them
but they re not real any more than that lincoln or surak what do the sensors read
as life-forms they are living beings
could they be aliens projecting an illusion
the readings are those of humanoids
do you wish further clarification your choice of action is unlimited as is your choice of weapons should you wish to use any you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you can find around you captain
mister spock and refuse to participate
you will decide otherwise and changes back into real lump of rock
analysis spock why do they want us to fight
it may be exactly as explained captain our concept of good and evil is strange to them perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest
and they ll get their answers if it kills us
afraid none of us may leave gentlemen until we do what it demands of us
captain kirk may speak with you quite agree with your attitude toward this charade it ridiculous to think that we should take part in it
what do you want
the same thing as you do to get out of here have no quarrel with you any more than you have with me
you re somewhat different than the way history paints you colonel green
history tends to exaggerate suggest we call halt to this at once and see if we can find some way out of our difficulties my associates are in full agreement with me captain you were tricked into coming here weren you so were we all
where do you come from
can remember isn that strange my memory used to be quite remarkable well wherever it was want to get back so it seems to me captain that we have common cause and our enemy is that creature
what do you propose reason some way to overcome it at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them altogether true no there is much would change now if could don let prejudice and rumour sway you meanwhile the other three baddies split up and start to circle around
captain how can we warn him khan throws rock at spock and fight starts until the bad guys run off
anyone hurt
fear my clothing is somewhat damaged but how delightful to discover at my age that can still wrestle
mister spock
all right captain however suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack
no think colonel green is right that rock-like thing is our enemy not those illusions
for an illusion my opponent carried considerable punch oh forgot you consider me an illusion too
the captain speaks wisely those four are not our enemy we should arrive together at peaceful settlement
am disappointed you display no interest in the honour we do you we offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful you find my body heat distressing captain you forget the nature of this planet must conclude that your species requires cause to fight for you may now communicate with your ship
kirk to enterprise enterprise come in lieutenant
emergency increasing sir
give me that again man cannot hear you
mister scott have the captain
scotty do you read me
mister scott have the captain
engineering check for radiation get repair crew on it at once
is there danger of detonation
red alert captain mister scott is standing by
don know yet sir
captain
scotty beam us up fast
cannot we have complete power failure
what happened
can explain it sir but the matter and antimatter are in red zone proximity
there no knowing and there no stopping it either the shielding is breaking down estimate four hours before it goes completely four hours before the ship blows up
the estimate is quite correct your ship will blow itself to bits within four hours captain unless you defeat the others before then is that cause enough to fight for
what if they defeat us crew you have to win
scotty inform starfleet command disengage nacelles jettison if possible mister spock assist them advise and analyse scotty scotty
your communicators no longer function captain you may proceed with the spectacle
james the war is forced upon us history repeats itself supplemental log stardate 5906 engineer scott reporting the enterprise is doomed to explode in two hours if captain kirk is defeated by the enemy on the surface of the planet the enormous power of the enterprise has been neutralised and we sit here watching unable to assist
did you set the traps
yes
what did you find out what are they doing
they ve done nothing they ve not armed themselves nor prepared for any kind of defence say attack now and finish them
with what these pointed sticks
better than what they have
no it not advantage enough want to make sure the odds are in our favour overwhelm and devastate that the way to get power and to hold it and mean to do that
there nothing immoral about fighting an illusion mister spock we play their game fight or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard
and if they re real captain
we ll use this as base it defensible they can approach without being seen
are we fighting defensive war james
no we don have time but if things go against us want place to retreat to what want to do now is scout them out find their weaknesses and attack
do you drink whiskey
occasionally why
because you have qualities very much like those of another man admire greatly general grant
thank you thank you mister spock we ll need weapons believe the ancient vulcans made something like boomerang
yes captain
and slings and spears slings mister president you used sling as boy
indeed did
captain logic dictates that we consider another course
we don have much time spock
in my time on vulcan we also faced these same alternatives we suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet another was about to begin we were torn but out of our suffering some of us found the discipline to act we sent emissaries to our opponents to propose peace the first were killed but others followed ultimately we achieved peace which has lasted since then
circumstances were different then surak
the face of war has never changed captain surely it is more logical to heal than kill
afraid that kind of logic doesn apply here
that is precisely why we should not fight
my ship is at stake
will not harm others captain
his convictions are most profound in this matter captain
so are mine spock if believed that there was peaceful way out of this
the risk will be mine alone if fail you lose nothing after all no warrior
the captain knows that have fought at his side before and will do so now if need be however too am vulcan bred to peace let him attempt it
you saw how treacherously they acted
oh yes but perhaps it our belief in peace that is actually being tested
have no authority over you you may do as you think best
thank you may you live long and prosper
the weapons gentlemen in case he fails
colonel they watch surak approach zora makes to throw spear
no let hear what he has to say we may find it useful stop there vulcan state your purpose
come in peace to propose peace
are you surrendering surak doing what consider best for all of us if you choose to regard that as surrender accept your definition
one of those peace lovers colonel
why are you doing this do you speak for the others
no speak for myself because abhor violence but if you accept the solution offer they too will accept it you re trying to trick me vulcan think that while you re here talking peace the others are preparing to attack answer
how can believe that no one talks peace unless he ready to back it up with war
he talks peace if it is the only way to live
then tell me what do you have to gain if we accept
nothing but the knowledge that have done what believe in
what do get out of it fight for gain vulcan what do gain here
your life and the lives of the others you said yourself colonel that we have common cause to survive together we can but not by warring
why don we kill him
no he our means to finish them all kahless and khan circle around
colonel surely you accept the logic of this what is your answer
you re very persuasive vulcan like to come out of this with whole skin perhaps can convince my associates that it would be to their advantage also kirk spock and lincoln are also sharpening sticks as spears
your surak is brave man
men of peace usually are captain on vulcan he is revered as the father of our civilisation the father image holds much meaning for us
you show emotion spock
deeply respect what he has accomplished
hope he accomplishes something here and soon scream rings out
surak
they re trying to goad us into attacking captain they expect us to act rashly
yes know that
he was aware of what might happen when he went
should never have let him go
you had no choice captain you could not have stopped him
how can you ignore that
vulcan would not cry out so
whether he vulcan or not he in agony
am not insensitive to it captain
but you can just listen to it and do nothing can
captain that is what they are waiting for they re waiting for us to attempt rescue
can just let him stay there
perhaps we can rescue him mister spock now suggest that we do whatever they want
do what they want sir
not the way they want it however we must first convince them that they have provoked us to recklessness james do not mean to presume upon your authority what propose is that circle around to their rear while you two provide frontal assault it should be sufficiently violent to cover whatever do
and what will you do
why slip into their camp and free him
no
james james remember was something of backwoodsman doubt that you could do what was bred to
can let you risk it mister president
am no longer president mister spock any comment
no sir
one matter further gentlemen we fight on their level with trickery brutality finality we match their evil know james was reputed to be gentle man but was commander in chief during the four bloodiest years of my country history gave orders that sent hundred thousand men to their death at the hands of their brothers there is no honourable way to kill no gentle way to destroy there is nothing good in war except its ending and you are fighting for the lives of your crew
your campaign mister president
they should be coming soon green and khan see kirk and spock duck down behind large rock carrying lot of spears
zora kahless no wait spock throws the first spear
how many do you see
two
zora she goes to circle around khan and kirk throw rocks at each other meanwhile very stealthy lincoln has found surak
surak green and kahless arrive
surak the others have drawn them away we will circle around it was worthy effort surak worthy no need to blame yourself before its failure but once untied surak is revealed to be dead
as surak help me spock help me spock
now can you cry like lincoln
as lincoln help me kirk help me kirk lincoln walks towards kirk and spock
mister lincoln
james stay back lincoln finally topples forward big spear in his back now the close fighting begins with green letting his associates do the hard work zora runs off kirk deals with kahless and helps spock with khan the bad guys retreat kirk chases and catches green who ends up falling on his own dagger
you are the survivors the others have run off it would seem that evil retreats when forcibly confronted however you have failed to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies your good and your evil use the same methods achieve the same results do you have an explanation
you established the methods and the goals
for you to use as you chose
what did you offer the others if they won
what they wanted most power
you offered me the lives of my crew
perceive you have won their lives
how many others have you done this to what gives you the right to hand out life and death
the same right that brought you here the need to know new things
we came in peace
and you may go in peace
kirk to enterprise come in
yes mister sulu we re all right you may beam us aboard
mister scott report
the ship is functioning normally again sir and the restart cycle is in operation you never know anything had been out of order can fathom it
mister sulu
we should be on warp power within thirty minutes sir
good mister chekov
the deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing itself have no explanation
thank you mister chekov mister spock any explanation
conjecture captain rather than explanation
well
it would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired so they were able to create images of surak and lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter
they seemed so real and to me especially mister lincoln feel actually met lincoln
yes and surak perhaps in sense they were real captain since they were created out of our own thoughts how could they be anything but what we expected them to be
it was so hard for me to see him die again feel understand what earth must have gone through to achieve final peace
captain kirk the planet has resumed its normal appearance
there still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy spock mister sulu break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment
aye aye sir captain log stardate 5843 the enterprise is in the grip of raging epidemic three crewmen have died and twenty three others have been struck down by rigelian fever in order to combat the illness doctor mccoy needs large quantities of ryetalyn which is the only known antidote for the fever our sensors have picked up sufficient quantities of pure ryetalyn on small planet in the omega system we are beaming down to secure this urgently needed material compared to the lurid red purple and vivid blue of the planet from space the ground is pretty normal
report
jim there large deposit bearing two seven three four kilometres away ve got four hours to process that stuff otherwise the epidemic will be irreversible everybody on board the enterprise will
strange readings indicate life form in the vicinity apparently human yet ship sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited
let get that ryetalyn strange device comes travelling through the air towards them bit like nomad but much smaller and with more round bits it fires an energy beam at the landing party feet they try to fire their phasers
inoperative the device fires again and closes in
do not kill the device backs away and silver-haired man in sort of doublet and hose approaches
captain james kirk
know who you are have monitored your ship since it entered this system
then if you know who we are you know why we re here mister
flint you will leave my planet
did you say your planet sir
my retreat from the unpleasantness of life on earth and the company of people
mister flint have sick crew up there we can possibly reach another planet in time you can refuse us the ryetalyn
you re trespassing captain
we re in need we ll pay for it work for it trade for it
you have nothing want
but you have the ryetalyn that we need if necessary we ll take it
if you do not leave voluntarily have the power to force you to leave or kill you where you stand
kirk to enterprise mister scott lock phasers onto our co-ordinates
mister flint if anything happens to us four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn
an interesting test of power your enormous forces against mine who would win
mister flint unless you are certain would suggest you refrain from most useless experiment
we need only few hours
have you ever seen victim of rigelian fever they die in one day the effects are like bubonic plague
constantinople summer 1334 it marched through the streets the sewers it left the city by ox cart by sea to kill half of europe the rats rustling and squealing in the night as they too died the rats
are you student of history sir
am the enterprise plague ship you have two hours at the end of which time you will leave
with all due gratitude
m4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need the device leaves permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings comfortable room with 18th century furniture woven rugs paintings on the wall
come in gentlemen our ship sensors did not reveal your presence here mister flint
my planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness protection against the curious the uninvited
then you live here alone
except for m4 which serves as butler housekeeper gardener and guardian
most impressive home mister flint
yes shakespeare first folio gutenberg bible young woman sits in high-backed carved chair watching monitor image of kirk that one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy spanning centuries brandy
do we trust him
it would seem logical to do so for the moment
well ll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin
if that ryetalyn isn here in one hour we ll go prospecting right over mister flint if necessary
this is the most splendid private collection of art ve ever seen and the most unique the majority are the works of leonardo da vinci renaissance period some of the works of reginald pollack 20th century and even sten from marcus two
at last have seen other humans
other men
one is not human
the vulcan
oh so that is vulcan would like to discuss sub-dimensional physics with him you ve taught me all you know in the area and you say vulcans know more
even he is not your intellectual equal nor mine
let me meet them
they are selfish brutal part of the human community which rejected and from which ve shielded you
soon they will be gone let me meet them
rayna nearly kisses her have you been lonely
what is loneliness
it is thirst it is flower dying in the desert
flint don take this opportunity away from me it so exciting
exciting you have never made demand of me before
sorry
do not be sorry it might be interesting
saurian brandy one hundred years old jim
please
mister spock know you won have one heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice
thank you doctor will have brandy
do you think the two of us can handle drunk vulcan once alcohol hits that green blood
if appear distracted it is because of what have seen am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion
ll drink to that what emotion
envy none of these da vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced they are unknown works all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials as undiscovered da vinci they would be priceless
would be you mean you think they re fakes
most strange man of flint obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin
well this could be what it seems to be or it could be cover setup or even an illusion
well that could explain the paintings similar to the real thing
spock at your earliest opportunity take full tricorder reading of our host see if he human kirk to enterprise mister scott
mister scott run full computer check on mister flint and on this planet holberg nine one seven stand by with your results ll contact
kirk out let enjoy this brandy it tastes real m4 glides in with bag of purple crystals and puts it on the table it leaves
easy bones
ryetalyn ready to be processed into antitoxin
beam up to the ship and start processing
that will not be necessary captain m4 can prepare the ryetalyn for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard your ship
would like to supervise that of course
and when you are satisfied as to procedures hope you will do me the honour of being my guests at dinner
thank you mister flint don think we have the time
regret my earlier inhospitality let me make amends rayna enters and that thud you hear is kirk jaw hitting the floor
gentlemen may present rayna
thought you lived alone
meant there are no others besides my family doctor mccoy mister spock
mister spock do hope we can find moment to discuss field density and its relationship to gravity phenomena
indeed would appreciate such talk it is an interest of mine
captain kirk
captain kirk
rayna
her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ before dying they placed their infant rayna kapec in my custody have raised and educated her
with most impressive results sir what else interests you besides gravity phenomena rayna
everything less than that is betrayal of the intellect
the totality of the universe all knowledge
rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees in the sciences and arts she is aware that the intellect is not all but its cultivation must come first or the individual makes errors wastes time in unprofitable pursuits
at her age rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage but must admit you re the farthest thing from bookworm ve ever seen
flint is my teacher you are the only other men ve ever seen
the misfortune of men everywhere and our privilege
if you would accompany my robot to the laboratory doctor you can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed
thank you sir mccoy and m4 leave
your pleasure gentlemen chess billiards conversation
why not all three m4 leads mccoy into lab then disappears through door mccoy examines the large coloured jars on table whilst m4 works behind an opaque window rayna sends the cue ball around all four cushions to hit both reds billiards
did you teach her that
we play often
may show you captain
you said something about savagery mister flint when was the last time you visited earth
you would tell me that it is no longer cruel but it is captain look at your starship bristling with weapons its mission to colonise exploit destroy if necessary to advance federation causes rayna guides kirk shot but he misses anyway
thank you our missions are peaceful our weapons defensive if we were barbarians we would not have asked for ryetalyn indeed your greeting not ours lacked certain benevolence
the result of pressures which are not your concern
yes well those pressures are everywhere in everyone urging him to what you call savagery the private hells the inner needs and mysteries the beast of instinct as human beings that is the way it is to be human is to be complex you can avoid little ugliness from within and from without while rayna is very close to kirk spock is at gold carved grand piano
why don you play the waltz mister spock to be human is also to seek pleasure to laugh to dance rayna is most accomplished dancer
may have the pleasure so the couple do an old-fashioned waltz as spock plays in the lab m4 brings three vials to mccoy for analysis kirk and rayna are now literally cheek to cheek flint is watching her carefully mccoy enters
is something wrong
yes there something wrong the ryetalyn is no good it contains irillium nearly one part per thousand
irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless
most unfortunate that it was not detected shall go with m4 to gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself you re welcome to join me doctor
thank you flint leaves
time factor bones epidemic
nearly two and half hours guess we ve got time to get in under the wire ve never seen anything like the speed of that robot it take us twice as long to process that stuff
but would we have made the error
jim what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium
go with flint keep an eye on procedures
like hawk mccoy leaves
captain something else which is rather extraordinary this waltz just played is by johannes brahms
later spock
captain it is written in manuscript in original manuscript in brahms own hand which recognise it is totally unknown definitely the work of brahms and yet unknown
think will go to the laboratory there may be way of reversing the irillium effect and saving the existing antitoxin stay here let me know when flint and mccoy return captain log stardate 5843 75 have committed grave error in accepting flint word that he would deliver the antidote to us the precious time have let pass may result in disaster for the enterprise and her crew kirk is having look around when rayna enters and goes to closed door
you left us the room became lonely
it is thirst flower dying in the desert
what what in there
do not know flint told me never to enter he denies me nothing else
then why are you here
do not know come here when am troubled when would search myself
are you troubled now
yes
by what are you happy here with flint
he is the greatest kindest wisest man in the galaxy
then why are you afraid he embraces her don be afraid kirk kisses rayna m4 enters and rayna is scared kirk pushes her away
stop command stop m4 ignores her and pursues kirk around the room spock vapourises it with his phaser as it starts to fire at kirk
thank you mister spock
fortunately the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser
m4 was programmed to defend this household and its members no doubt should have altered its instructions to allow for unauthorised but predictable actions on your part it thought you were attacking rayna misinterpretation
if it were around right now it would correct m4 enters
too useful device to be without really created another it will now go to the laboratory and join doctor mccoy m4 leaves
fascinating
be thankful that you did not attack me captain might have accepted battle and have twice your physical strength
in your own words it would be an interesting test of power
how childish he is rayna would you call him brave or fool
glad he did not die
of course death when unnecessary is tragic thing doctor mccoy in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn he satisfied as to its quality may suggest that you wait here patiently safely you have seen that my defence systems operate automatically and not always in accordance with my wishes come rayna rayna come rayna reluctantly tears herself away from kirk and they both leave
don like the way he orders her around
since we are dependent on mister flint for the ryetalyn captain may respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again our host interests do not appear to be confined to art and science
he loves her
strongly indicated
jealousy yes that would explain the attack but he seemed to want us together the billiard game he suggested we dance
it does appear to defy the male logic as understand it
kirk to enterprise mister scott
report on the rigelian fever
nearly everybody aboard has got it captain we re working skeleton crew and waiting for the ryetalyn search
there is no report on mister flint he doesn seem to have any past ago by mister brack wealthy financier and recluse
run computer check on rayna kapec status legal ward after the death of her parents
kirk out mister scott
we have still greater mystery captain was able to run tricorder scan on mister flint he is human but there are certain biophysical peculiarities some body function readings are disproportionate for one thing extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years
can you confirm that mister spock
shall programme the readings through doctor mccoy medical computer when we return to the ship
time factor
we must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all
what keeping the processing this time linger yet he is apprehensive it is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move flint turns off the screen
you sent the robot to kill him
it came to protect you
my mind could not have summoned it was not frightened
it was defective then would have destroyed it myself have lied to you
never
believe what say would not want captain kirk dead what did you feel
you will let them have the ryetalyn
yes go to them if you wish say your farewells
kirk here federation legal banks
no award of custody
no background at all in any computer banks like flint
kirk out like flint people without past what hold does he have over her
captain would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn
let find mccoy
captain
ll meet you in the lab spock leaves
ve come to say goodbye
don want to say goodbye flint watches on the monitor as kirk kisses rayna and she starts to respond
last tender encounter captain kirk to end your usefulness
tell you spock was waiting for the robot to finish the processing and the next thing knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn
interesting obviously mister flint is not yet ready for us to depart
well think we better tell jim
the captain wanted us to wait here
come with me offer you happiness
ve known security here
childhood must end you love me not flint rayna dashes out of the room kirk enters
flint lied the ryetalyn isn here
picking up tricorder readings captain apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door
why is flint playing tricks on us apparently we re supposed to go in and get it if we can well let not disappoint the chess master phasers on full the door opens by itself
captain shall get the ryetalyn
why you
there may be dangers within
let find out
let me go alone captain
why get to the point spock if there is one
we ll all go they go down short corridor into another laboratory the vials of ryetalyn are on table
the ryetalyn and over by the far wall is covered figure with the label rayna 16 kirk takes look at it it is bald version of rayna they look further and see others rayna 14 rayna 15 captain log stardate 5843 we have accomplished our mission and have the ryetalyn ready to combat the epidemic aboard the enterprise but we have also discovered our benefactor secret he has created the perfect woman her only flaw she not human
physically human but not human these are earlier versions of rayna jim she an android
created here by my hand here the centuries of loneliness were to end
your collection of leonardo da vinci masterpieces mister flint they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials and on your piano waltz by johannes brahms an unknown work in manuscript written in modern ink yet absolutely authentic as are your paintings
am brahms
and da vinci
yes
how many other names shall we call you
solomon alexander lazarus methuselah merlin abramson hundred other names you do not know
you were born
in that region of earth later called mesopotamia in the year 3834 bc as the millennia are reckoned was akharin soldier bully and fool fell in battle pierced to the heart and did not die
instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal you learned that you were immortal and
and to conceal it to live some portion of life to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected
your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition you knew the greatest minds in history
galileo socrates moses have married hundred times captain selected loved cherished caressed smoothness inhaled brief fragrance then age death the taste of dust do you understand
you wanted perfect ultimate woman as brilliant as immortal as yourself your mate for all time
designed by my heart could not love her more
spock you knew
had hoped was wrong
you cannot love an android captain love her she is my handiwork my property she is what desire
you brought me here to learn this does she know
she will never know
let go
you will stay
why
we have discovered what he is captain
if you leave the curious would follow the foolish the meddlers the officials the seekers my privacy was my own its invasion be on your head
we can remain silent
the disaster of intervention spock ve known it will not risk it
kirk to enterprise we see flint press button and the enterprise disappear from its orbit
clear out of the area inform starfleet command enterprise scotty
they cannot answer captain model enterprise appears on table kirk peers in through the viewscreen to see everyone stationary
my crew
the test of power you had no chance it is time for you to join your crew
you wipe out four hundred lives why
have seen hundred billion fall know death better than any man have tossed enemies into his grasp and know mercy your crew is not dead but suspended
worse than dead restore them restore my ship
in time thousand two thousand years you will know the future captain kirk
you have been such men you ve known and created such beauty you ve watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life and yet now you would do this to us
the flowers of my past hold the nettles of the present am flint now with my needs
what needs
tonight have seen something wondrous something ve waited for laboured for nothing must endanger it at last rayna emotions have stirred to life now they will turn to me in this solitude which preserve
no
rayna
you must not do this to them
must
what will you feel for him after we are gone
all emotions are in play mister flint you harm us she hates you
give me back my ship your secret is safe with us the model enterprise disappears and appears back in orbit
that why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn you realised what was happening you kept us together rayna and me because you knew could bring her emotions alive and now you re just going to take over
shall take what is mine when she comes to me we are mated captain alike immortal you must forget your feelings in this matter which is quite impossible for you
impossible impossible from the beginning you used me can love her but do love her and she loves me
no they tussle
captain your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances
stay out of this we re fighting over woman
no you re not for she is not flint thumps kirk then repeatedly throws him across the room
cannot be the cause of this will not be the cause of this please stop stop choose where want to go the men stop fighting in astonishment
what want to do choose choose
rayna
no do not order me no one can order me
she human down to the last blood cell she human down to the last thought hope aspiration emotion she human the human spirit is free you have no power of ownership she free to do as she wishes
gentlemen urge you to stop there is danger
no man beats me
don want to beat you this is no test of power rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills to do as she wills to think as she wills
that what ve worked for
rayna come with me
stay
was not human now love love she collapses mccoy checks for pulse
you can die
what happened
she loved you captain and you too mister flint as mentor even as father there was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions she could not bear to hurt either of you the joys of love made her human and the agonies of love destroyed her
spock
the epidemic is reduced and no longer threat the enterprise is on course five one three mark seven as you ordered
very old and lonely man and young and lonely man we put on pretty poor show didn we if only could forget he rests his head on his arms on the desk mccoy enters
jim oh thank heaven sleeping at last
your report doctor
oh those tricorder readings on mister flint are finally
he dying you see flint in leaving earth with all of its complex fields within which he was formed sacrificed immortality he ll live the remainder of normal life span then die
on that day shall mourn does he know
yes told him myself he intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition and who knows what he might come up with
indeed
well guess that all can tell jim later or you can considering his opponent longevity truly an eternal triangle you wouldn understand that would you spock you see feel sorrier for you than do for him because you ll never know the things that love can drive man to the ecstasies the miseries the broken rules the desperate chances the glorious failures the glorious victories all of these things you ll never know simply because the word love isn written into your book goodnight spock
goodnight doctor
do wish he could forget her mccoy leaves spock goes over to kirk and initiates mind meld
forget captain log stardate 5818 botanical plague is devastating planet in the quadrant of the galaxy where the enterprise is operating at present it threatens to destroy the vegetation on the entire planet leaving it uninhabitable
dictating at federation orders we re proceeding at top warp speed to the planet ardana where the only source of zenite exists it is the one substance that can halt the plague
captain the high advisor of ardana is ready to receive you on stratos sir
on stratos that their cloud city isn it mister spock
it is captain
there must be some mistake do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available
they ve already been provided to the transport officer captain along with those of the council chamber of the high advisor
kirk to transporter room
mister scott are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city stratos
the mine entrance that what you ordered captain
fine uhura tell the high advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency and that we re beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite the need is urgent
aye sir
mister spock come with me oh and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future
aye sir an area with jagged purple rocks under an orange sky kirk and spock arrive on an artificial platform and gaze up at city literally in the clouds
stratos captain city actually floating in the sky
looks as tranquil as its reputation doesn it
it is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy have you ever visited here captain
once didn have time to look around
ve never had the opportunity however hear its art forms are incomparable
yes art is the population chief occupation
it is totally intellectual society all forms of violence have been eliminated
there the mine entrance the zenite consignment should have been there don understand it those troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down
perhaps there is another entrance captain
perhaps
it would seem the troglytes have changed their minds about delivery kirk and spock are lassoed by three people in boiler suits and hard hats
who are you what the meaning of this attack
woman in blue interference breeds attack captain come on
we re here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission
move on captain there is fight two against four then three figures beam down onto the platform
troglytes halt the attackers make to run off
surrender or we ll fire three escape one gets shot
are you harmed gentlemen
no just little shaken up
plasus high advisor of the planet council
captain kirk enterprise my first officer mister spock
greetings mister advisor
my regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to ardana
it was rather warm
unfortunately violence is habitual with the troglytes but assure you this insult will not go unpunished
well more concerned with the zenite consignment why wasn it in its specified location
apparently the disrupters have confiscated it as knew they would
the disrupters who are they
small group of troglyte malcontents all the other troglytes are completely dominated by them it the disrupters who are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite
they agreed to the delivery your council assured us of it
they agreed obviously as ruse to get valuable hostages
hostages for what purpose
to force the council to meet their demands to guards organise search party immediately and find the zenite consignment guards leave
meanwhile captain would suggest that you and first officer spock be our guests on stratos
very well do hope the search will be brief mister advisor
we ll do everything possible to make it so come gentlemen plasus kirk and spock beam onto balcony at the edge of stratos with wonderful view of brown river and its tributaries
remarkable the finest example of sustained antigravity elevation ve ever seen
the sentinel told me of our honoured guests my father came to extend greetings
most gracious act one of our planet most incomparable works of art my daughter droxine captain james kirk
pleasure madam
indeed yes captain
and first officer spock
have never before met vulcan sir
nor work of art madam
come gentlemen there is much to see in our city this is our council gallery it is open to all city dwellers we have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and contemplation of every there is dagger in the wall
disrupters again
how dreadful they re despoiling the whole city
despoil for what purpose
by keeping us in constant turmoil they hope to force the council to accede to their demands
what are their demands
completely unreasonable captain but nothing you need be concerned with
must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to merak two
mister advisor the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet obviously if all plant life is destroyed the humanoid life will follow
assure you gentlemen you will get what you came for
hope so ardana is member of the federation and it is your council responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the federation
of course and we accept the responsibility
but why do they destroy art forms that is loss to everyone
art means nothing to the disrupters this the dagger is the only form they understand the disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying no doubt you would like to rest
that would be most welcome mister advisor
chambers have been prepared for you sentinel will guide you to them kirk and spock leave
sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet
it fortunate that they were not seriously hurt
oh yes that would have been dreadful
further violence could create grave difficulties between ardana and the federation
the disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming strangers
they grow more daring and determined every day now they seek to find allies in the galaxy
do you think that captain kirk and his very attractive officer will feel that we re responsible for their injuries
all this time thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations two sentinels drag in troglyte
apologies mister advisor but this troglyte was apprehended leaving the city he is without transport card so we thought you would want to question him
remove his shields the sentinel takes off the troglyte sunglasses
what is your business in stratos troglyte speak command you
my business is to repair
repair what
there are damaged entrance panels
indeed then you must have repair permit where is it
it was forgotten
did you also forget your transport card
it was lost when your sentinels attacked me
and where was your cavern implement lost could this perhaps be it
came to make repairs
and you shall make them by giving us the names of the disrupters
know nothing
would advise you to increase your knowledge
that is not possible for troglyte the stratos city dwellers have said it
secure him to the rostrum but the troglyte breaks free of the sentinels and jumps over the balcony instead
how unfortunate how unfortunate kirk is sleeping spock is meditating contrasts those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens it is not wise leadership here on stratos everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant the high advisor charming daughter droxine particularly so the name droxine seems appropriate for her wonder can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet there the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with bitter hatred the young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation if the lovely droxine knew of the young miner misery wonder how the knowledge would affect her spock hears sound and goes into the next room droxine is preparing refreshments
mister spock thought you had accompanied captain kirk to the rest chamber
your movements awakened me
my apologies did not realise they would disturb you
only vulcan ears would find the noise discernible
it seems that vulcans are fascinatingly different in many ways
the same may be said of stratos inhabitants
vulcan eyes are very discerning too hear that intellectually vulcans are as highly evolved as stratos city dwellers
we do pride ourselves on our logic dressed in stratos fashion the female miner enters the rest room armed with her mining tool she leans over kirk but he grabs her pulls her down onto the bed and disarms her
you again
you sleep lightly captain
yes duty is good teacher see you ve changed your dressmaker
release me
so you can attack me again that would be foolish
call the guards if you re afraid captain
not afraid in fact find this rather enjoyable
do not
all right ll make deal with you you answer some questions and ll let you up
what questions
your word first
will answer but as soon as he lets go she grabs for the weapon again and he has to fight her again meanwhile in the next room the ears that heard droxine don hear the fighting
you only take mate once every seven years
the seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all vulcan at that time the mating drive outweighs all other motivations
and is there nothing that can disturb that cycle mister spock
extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing madam in the rest area
did not come here to kill you captain
then why this
to take you hostage spock and droxine enter
am intruding captain
vanna
droxine
why have you come here
to welcome our honoured guests as was taught to do when served in your father household
has she injured you captain
no not at all in fact her visit was quite enlightening
oh
yes it seems the troglytes are under the impression that the enterprise is here to intimidate them
into intercom send sentinel to the rest chamber immediately
it is not impression captain it is the truth
we re here to get that zenite consignment and that it
starships do not transport cargo
in times of emergency they do anything and believe me this botanical plague is an emergency
lies will not keep the troglytes in the caverns and neither will your starship
you talk like disrupter vanna
speak for my people they have as much right to the clouds as the stratos dwellers
but stratos is for advisors and studiers what would troglytes do here
live in the sunlight and warmth as everyone should
the caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light just as your minds are not accustomed to logic sentinel takes vanna away
unaccustomed to light and warmth that necessary to all humanoids surely you don deny it to the troglytes
the troglytes are workers captain oh surely you must be aware of that they mine zenite for shipment till the soil those things cannot be done here
in other words they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain stratos
that is their function in our society
but they are not allowed to share its advantages
how can they share what they do not understand
they can be taught to understand especially in society that prides itself in enlightenment
the complete separation of toil and leisure has given ardana this perfectly balanced social system captain why should we change it
the surface of the planet is almost unendurable to restrict segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture
the surface is marred by violence like the troglytes but here in stratos we have completely eliminated violence vanna is shackled to granite-looking device
you still refuse to disclose the names of the other disrupters
there are no disrupters
very well if you prefer the rays the curved section of the device facing vanna lights up and makes vanna glow the sound of the rays can be heard in the background
troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient earth term its technical translation is cave dweller
yes should have realised scream rings out kirk and spock go to investigate
mister advisor the rays are switched off and vanna slumps
you said you were going to question vanna not torture her
she stubborn and as you yourself pointed out captain the search for your zenite consignment must be short
surely there are better methods than this
physical discomfort is extremely persuasive captain
yes but won stand by while someone is tortured
is it preferable to spare vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed
violence in reality is quite different from theory is it not madam
but what else can they understand mister spock
all the little things you and understand and expect from life such as equality kindness justice
troglytes are not like stratos dwellers mister spock they re conglomerate of inferior species the abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension
the abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to vanna
few troglytes are brought here as retainers vanna was one of them as are the sentinels they ve received more training than the others
but obviously no more consideration
fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism
the only way you ll use that device again is on one of us
an imposing display of primitive gallantry gentlemen you realise of course that the sentinels could remove you
of course but starfleet command won take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel mister advisor
why are you so concerned with this disrupter well-being
beyond plain humanitarianism my orders are to get that zenite
then stop interfering and ll get it for you
you won get it through torture
we will get it for you and in our own way remove the prisoner to confinement quarters you will return to your ship at once or shall contact your starfleet command myself and report your interference with this planet government
kirk to enterprise
mister scott we re ready to beam up kirk and spock are beamed away
to sentinel if captain kirk appears again kill him captain log star date 5819 more than eight hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared and we have still found no trace of it we ve received word from merak two that the plague is spreading rapidly delivery of the zenite is imperative within twelve hours or all life on the planet will be annihilated
lieutenant uhura advise starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered in my opinion plasus method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed if the zenite is not delivered shortly shall have to violate plasus order of non-interference and win the confidence of the troglyte leader with the use of reason
that may not be easy jim medical analysis indicates the troglytes are mentally inferior
that impossible bones the troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice common cause mentally inferior beings aren capable of that
look ve checked my findings thoroughly their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average
but they re all the same species those who live on stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet their physical and mental evolution must be similar that is basic biological law
that true spock but obviously the ancestors of those who live on stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths
natural growths what kind
well had this zenite sample sent up from the surface now unsealed it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here
incredible zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria no side effects have ever been reported
there are none after it refined but in its raw state it emits odourless invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional therefore it releases violent reaction
and the mines are full of that gas
that right and the troglytes are constantly exposed to it
bones the disrupters vanna it seems impossible they ve outwitted highly organised scientific culture for months
as part of the staff of stratos vanna was removed from exposure for long period it is likely that without such exposure the effect slowly wears off
that right spock the other disrupters were probably removed from exposure too
does the brain return to normal
according to findings it should
can you neutralise the gas
no but filter mask should remove the exposure
find one meet us in the transporter room kirk spock and mccoy are talking to plasus on wall monitor
this mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life chemical as well as bacterial we have used these filter masks frequently on can achieve intellectual equality for the troglytes
there every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary even after repeated exposure evolution have failed to do
doctor mccoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly we ve checked his findings through the computer and they re absolutely valid who also dwelt in caverns evolved sufficiently to erect stratos while the troglytes did not
unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas mister advisor
there no time to argue about the findings now simply propose to tell vanna all about them nonsense
this nonsense might mean great deal to the troglytes would like to offer them supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment more unrest among them cannot allow it until our scientists have checked the findings
but that could take days
are you afraid the filter masks will work is that why you don want the troglytes to try them conduct tests captain
am here to get that zenite if these will help me get them ll use them entitle you to defy local governments this communication has ended
my diplomacy is somewhat inadequate
it pretty hard to overcome prejudice
doesn give us much choice does it
nor much time we have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to merak two
beam me down to vanna confinement quarters
you mean you re going back to stratos against government orders
if vanna doesn have something definite to gain for her people she ll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment this is the only thing that might convince her
captain if you are apprehended deliberately violating the high advisor orders he will be within his rights to have you executed if he chooses
if you re about to suggest that you contact vanna the answer is negative spock that goes for you too bones
allow me to point out that first officer is more expendable than either doctor or captain
officially yes but this mission is strictly unofficial nobody to have any part in it any responsibility for it but myself that an order spock you have the conn stand by till contact you it fair size with bed and table and horizontal bars across the doorway
vanna ve brought you gift there dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the troglytes exposed to it for period of time this mask will prevent any further damage
gas from zenite
yes
it hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm
that true but an idea can be seen or felt that what kept the troglytes in the mines all these centuries mistaken idea
would all the troglytes wear these masks
yes ll see to it that the federation engineers construct them
suppose plasus does not agree
plasus is not the whole government
that is true but the city council will not listen to troglytes
as soon as the zenite is delivered to merak two ll come back ll request permission to mediate for the troglytes vanna you must trust me give you my word
centuries ago stratos was built by leaders that gave their word that all inhabitants would live there the troglytes are still waiting
the zenite can be delivered in few hours you won have long to wait now
hours can be centuries just as words can be lies
vanna you must trust me if you don millions of people will die whole planet this zenite is all that can save them this filter mask is all that can save the troglytes trust me please
very well captain will trust you the consignment lies deep in the mines in place known only to troglytes cannot direct you must take you there you asked for my trust captain are you unwilling to give yours they hear footsteps
it the sentinel with my refreshment the sentinel enters puts down the tray and picks up the mask kirk stuns him with his phaser
wait we ll need transport pass to leave the city vanna leads kirk though tunnels then uses tool to hit the rock three times other troglytes appear
midro
vanna
anka
you have returned
and ve brought with me hostage seize him
wearing the mask we had bargain why did you break it
did you really think would trust you captain not such fool
trusted you
you thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and your unseen gas don believe you any more than plasus does
then you are fool these masks will free you just as said
our weapons are our freedom and you ve just furnished me with two very valuable ones yourself and this phaser
holding me won help you my men ll still come for that zenite consignment
without your communicator you will be hard to locate
they ll still come
perhaps in the meantime taste of our existence captain dig as the troglytes do as the troglytes do
without that mask haven
with your bare hands captain captain log supplemental stardate 5819 first officer spock reporting captain kirk beamed down to stratos to attempt to win the confidence of the rebel troglytes unless he has made his escape from stratos to the mines his life is in danger from the high advisor the captain has not informed us of his progress for our part we must maintain silence we can be of no help to him without jeopardising his life
you dig well captain the unseen gas doesn seem to be harming you
it takes while for its effects to be noticed
nevertheless you won be needing this anka deposit this on the transport platform so plasus will know we have something more valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs
you are clever vanna very clever anka leaves
searchers will be coming soon midro go to the other mines and tell the troglytes to post watchers
what of him
will see that he doesn escape
if we kill him there will be no need to see
dead hostage is of no value midro
only the troglytes will know
brought him here and will say what is to be done
you are not the only disrupter too can say
can you do nothing but argue the searchers will be here soon
when anka returns we will all say midro leaves
is that what disrupters are bargaining for the right to kill everyone
midro is child
the masks can change that
return to the digging captain
how long do you plan on keeping me here providing midro doesn kill me of course
until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds
that quite while longer than expected kirk jumps vanna gets the phaser and uses it to cause rockfall in the tunnel
we re sealed in
completely
but soon the atmosphere will go we ll die
die from something that can be seen you astound me vanna kirk to enterprise enterprise come in kirk to enterprise enterprise come in kirk to enterprise anything wrong
nothing are you locked in on me
locked in and ready to beam up consignment
circumstances dictate slight variation spock
standing by for instructions
hold on these co-ordinates locate the high advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately without advance communication repeat without advance communication have you got that spock
instructions clear shall carry them out immediately spock out
you would seal plasus here also for what purpose
am preparing demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas
beam the high advisor down without warning did he say
that not an exact quote mister scott however it does express the thought
like to see the advisor face
you will have that opportunity
the captain did say immediately did he not
now that is an exact quote mister scott and suggest you handle the transporter yourself this could be very delicate as problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain
aye droxine is gazing out from the balcony
something upsetting you droxine
no father
what is it tell me
no really not upset was just standing here looking into space and wondering whether or not he would return
he will never return ve seen to that
but the zenite is so important to him he must have it
it will be delivered if we have to kill every troglyte it will be delivered
by that time it may be too late perhaps he does have method
he knows nothing except how to destroy our power and our society forbid you ever to speak of captain kirk or even to think of him
spock here gallery ready to transport the high advisor
you ll have to delay
picking up two life-forms in the gallery another we cannot transport one
without the other captain order
precisely mister scott
until the high advisor is alone or can be isolated the captain will have to wait unless you have an alternative
no wasn thinking of captain kirk it the one with those exquisitely shaped ears his name is spock he the one was thinking about did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing why almost believe that if stood here and called out to him he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for little while longer
oh he no better than his friend
shall we try sentinel enters
what is it
the disrupter vanna has disappeared her guard was found half unconscious he been attacked by captain kirk
where is captain kirk
he did not know sir he did not regain his senses until came to his aid
this is the kind of reason they use to persuade us
they are desperate
will hear no more defence of them
sure mister spock would not behave so
leave here at once go to your music
father are we so sure of our methods that we never question what we do
spock to transporter room
lock in on council gallery co-ordinates
energise
energising
how are you doing mister scott
fine mister spock the high advisor materialising on the platform
beam him down to captain kirk immediately
good work mister scott captain too much trouble
the captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm
abduction of planet official is serious crime you will pay for this promise you
not until you re convinced of the effects of the zenite gas mister advisor
what effects ve been here nearly an hour of your earth time you and vanna even longer see no changes in any of us
perhaps you need closer exposure fill that container
are you suggesting that dig zenite
insist
you will indeed pay for this
you too vanna you too dig kirk here what is it
contact check captain it has been over an hour since your last communication
your orders are to stand by now carry them out kirk out
standing by captain only five hours left to kirk closes his communicator
that is very unlike the captain
can the zenite be affecting him
grow faint the oxygen is going
she right kirk transport us out of here
we ll leave when the gas has effect
it will never take effect transport us out of here
dig
imbecile we ll die
said dig
am high advisor of all the planet will take no more orders
one more step and ll kill you
the gas captain you were right it taking effect captain you were right
are you as brave with mortae as you are with phaser
both will kill kirk throws his phaser away and plasus attacks him with two mortae kirk quickly disarms him and they wrestle instead vanna notices the communicator has fallen off kirk belt and picks it up
enterprise enterprise help enterprise
enterprise spock here
help us enterprise spock activates the transporter kirk and plasus have their hands around each others throats when they materialise spock hauls kirk away from plasus
captain the zenite gas has affected you captain the zenite gas
the zenite gas
look out jim plasus attacks and kirk knocks him out
well it seems my little demonstration was quite success
don like filters or even masks like the word protector much better don you
it is less technical therefore less accurate but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function
it appears you have what you came for after all
the captain will have his zenite just as agreed
agreed there no such word in the troglyte vocabulary
the captain will have his zenite
no thanks to any agreement by you it had to be obtained by force
because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us
how about your education was that by force
it served your purpose at the time
you could have had those filters for all the good it will do you
they will be very effective sir they ve been severely tested and the troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties
they will all be like her ungrateful vindictive
yes our demands have just begun here is the zenite captain just as promised sentinels pile the containers on the balcony
thank you vanna
stratos is so pleasant and so beautiful think afraid to leave it
there is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below and only one way to really experience it
shall go to the mines no longer wish to be limited to the clouds is your planet like this one
no no vulcan is quite different
someday should like to visit it
perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties the federation bureau of industrialisation may be of aid to you
will tolerate absolutely no interference you will not set foot here as long as rule
believe me sir have neither the time nor the desire to return here only answering your charges against me will force me back
and shall press them you are guilty of abduction captain
you re guilty of attacking starship commander and plotting against his life
captain perhaps both incidents are best forgotten
yes vanna they never happened mister advisor plasus nods mister spock let get that zenite delivered believe we only have three hours left
two hours fifty-nine minutes to be exact captain
kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise mister scott beam us up captain log stardate 5630 we have been assigned to convey the medusans ambassador to the federation back to their home planet while the thoughts of the medusans are the most sublime in the galaxy their physical appearance is exactly the opposite they have evolved into race of beings who are formless so utterly hideous that the sight of medusan brings total madness to any human who sees one man beams aboard
mister marvick am james kirk the captain
captain what are you doing here you ll have to leave before the medusan ambassador arrives
yes everything will be taken care of this is mister spock my first officer marvick; oh yes you re the vulcan it all right for you to remain but you captain and this other gentleman
montgomery scott chief engineer call me scotty
mister spock do you have the visor you must be sure to wear it humans who get even glimpse of medusans have gone insane
thank you mister marvick shall be wearing the visor
we mustn keep the ambassador waiting if you ll go with mister scott sure the two of you will have great deal in common
aye indeed it rare privilege meeting one of the designers of the enterprise scott and marvick leave
lieutenant uhura open channel to transporter control centre on the planet
this is captain kirk inform the ambassador and doctor jones we re ready to beam them aboard kirk out are you sure this visor will work
it has proved effective for vulcans
it your human half worried about
shall endeavour to keep it under control
inform me when transport is complete kirk leaves spock puts on the red filter visor and beams aboard box and woman she removes her visor and gives the vulcan salute
welcome aboard ambassador kollos am first officer spock
doctor jones spock removes his visor the ambassador is most honoured to meet you mister spock spock fixes an anti-gravity handle to the ambassador box
captain kirk we are ready
lieutenant uhura open channel to all decks
channel open sir
this is captain kirk to all ship personnel clearance plans now in effect spock and jones are wearing their visors again escorted to his quarters at once the crew vacate the premises
doctor jones may congratulate you on your assignment with ambassador kollos
thank you but the assignment not yet definite it will depend upon my ability to achieve true mind-link with the ambassador
sure you will find it fascinating experience
wasn aware that anyone had ever achieved mind-link with the medusans
no one ever has was referring to mind-links had attempted with members of other species
ve heard mister spock that you turned down the assignment with the ambassador
was unable to accept my life is here they place the box on table
spock to bridge we have arrived at the ambassador quarters
thank you mister spock notify all hands to return to stations all right let take her out warp factor two
warp factor two sir spock removes the anti-gravity handle
would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the ambassador
sure the ambassador would be charmed the box opens slightly and green light fills the room there are images of myriad of lights then the lid shuts again
almost envy you your assignment
see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place
not correct doctor although am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine were you born telepath
yes that is why had to study on vulcan
understand may show you to your quarters
think ll stay here bit ambassador kollos often finds the process of transport somewhat unsettling
understand our ship surgeon often makes the same complaint do call when you are ready spock leaves jones removes her visor
what is it he sees when he looks at you must know the green light fills the room the senior staff are in dress uniform scott with more plaid than we ve seen before mister marvick is present too kirk pours drink while jones toys with red rose
can understand why they let you go with kollos
they captain
the male population of the federation didn someone try and talk you out of it
now that you ask yes
well glad he didn succeed otherwise wouldn have met you
thank you captain
tell me doctor jones why isn it dangerous for you to be with kollos spock can understand nothing makes an impression on him
why thank you captain
you re very welcome mister spock but no human can look at kollos even with visor without going mad how do you manage
spent four years on vulcan studying their mental discipline
you poor girl
on the contrary doctor would say that doctor jones was indeed fortunate
vulcan is not my idea of fun
joy can be many things doctor on vulcan learned to do things impossible to learn anywhere else
to read minds
how not to read them captain
don understand
doctor jones was born telepath captain
oh
vulcan was necessary to my sanity
what most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people thoughts and emotions
or of their own thoughts and emotions was just noticing your vulcan idic mister spock is it reminder that as vulcan you can mind-link with the medusans far better than could
well doubt that mister spock would don the most revered of all vulcan symbols merely to annoy you doctor jones
as matter of fact wear it this evening to honour you doctor
indeed
yes very interesting might even say fascinating but back to your mission doctor do you feel any way may be found to employ medusan navigators on starships it would certainly solve many of our navigational problems
the key is the mind-link that learned on vulcan once we have learned the technique of forming corporate intelligence with the medusans the designers that where larry comes in can work on adapting instruments
don care how benevolent the medusans are supposed to be isn it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad why do you do it
see doctor mccoy you still subscribe to the outmoded notion promulgated by your ancient greeks that what is good must also be beautiful
and the reverse of course that what is beautiful is automatically expected to be good
yes think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness one of the last of our prejudices at the risk of sounding prejudiced gentlemen here to beauty they stand for the toast to miranda jones the loveliest human ever to grace starship
how can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life will we allow it gentlemen
certainly not
how can one so full of joy and the love of life as you doctor condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life can we allow that gentlemen
to whatever you want the most miranda
some more antarean brandy seeing her far-away look what is it
there somebody nearby thinking of murder
in this room
it gone now
who is it can you tell
it isn there anymore captain would you mind if said goodnight
of course perhaps ll see
ll escort you to your quarters
thank you gentlemen you make choice impossible please stay and enjoy yourselves it was delightful dinner
sleep well miranda
are you sure you re well enough to find your way alone
of course doctor mccoy please don worry about me mccoy kisses her hand and she leaves
now where come from that what we call lady
yes she is something special
very special suggest you treat her accordingly ve known doctor jones long enough to be aware of her remarkable gifts well it been long day for me
larry would you like to stop off at engineering with me have few things to check and bottle of scotch says you can handle the controls you designed
some other time
good night gentlemen marvick and scott leave
good night scotty you dressed up for the occasion spock very impressive
genuinely intended to honour her captain good evening gentlemen
good evening sleep well spock leaves
bones what troubling you with the girl
well she not just another girl captain don make that mistake
didn think that for moment what else
don know what it is exactly she seems very vulnerable
we re all vulnerable in one way or another
of course but there something so very disturbing about her
meaning she quite woman agree
good night jim
good night bones the doorbell buzzes
who is it
it late
all right come in then marvick enters
thought the dinner was never going to end
rather enjoyed it
yes know you did didn you were so far away
ll be further away than that soon
please don talk of that there so little time please miranda don go with kollos
now we ve been over this time and time again
don know it ve asked you in restaurants in the laboratory on one knee on both knees miranda how can you do this
larry please try to understand
understand that you re woman and that man one of your own kind and that kollos will never be able to give you anything like this he kisses her but she doesn respond why did ever meet you
ve been honest with you simply cannot love you the way you want me to
miranda
and going away with kollos that final think you better leave now she turns away then gets the same impressions she had at dinner
so it you didn know that it was you before who is it you want to kill larry is it me you mustn keep this to yourself want to help you
so now you want to help me now know what mere human male has to do to get reaction out of you make you think he patient the great psychologist why don you try being woman for change marvick leaves and starts walking along the corridor then he stops turns and goes back to kollos quarters the medusan opens his box lid as marvick draws his phaser larry screams and writhes about in the presence of the alien miranda senses something is going on marvick dashes out into the corridor and runs into the turbolift miranda comes out of her room and goes to kollos without her visor she picks up the phaser from the floor marvick assaults crewman in another corridor kirk and security detachment followed by spock and mccoy arrive at kollos door
miranda
where mister scott
miranda the green light is gone and the lid is closing scott is in the upper level control area
ah there marvick so you couldn resist wee wager miranda comes out holding visor
has the ambassador been hurt
no harm has come to the ambassador captain
who could have done such thing
larry marvick
larry marvick why
do you know whether he saw the medusan
yes he did
then insanity will surely be the result captain dangerous insanity
the controls are all yours and the bottle of scotch ll be in your room this evening if you can handle em was made to murder ambassador kollos the murderer is dangerously insane he is lawrence marvick be on the watch for him kirk out scott tries to get larry away from the controls but is thrown off there is fight between the madman and three of starfleet finest insanity wins and the enterprise is sent careering off her course
explain lieutenant sulu
don believe this myself captain but we re travelling at warp factor eight point five
and accelerating
get engineering uhura
they don answer captain spock goes to the engineering station
warp factor nine and accelerating
can you disengage power from there mister spock
trying captain mister chekov your assistance please
captain have engineering now
put them on intercom worst they suffocate in your dreams we re making it out of here
security to engineering
ll go with you
no
must can reach his mind
we ll be safe at the boundaries of the universe we ll be safe kirk and three security men finally drag marvick away from the controls just as the ship hits the galactic boundary
scotty where are we
don know
beyond the boundaries of the galaxy we made it we re safe we re safe captain kirk
bones
oh no no no captain we mustn sleep no no no they come in your dreams that the worst they suffocate in your dreams no
all right all right
no
we ll take you to place to hide
no kirk; come on we must stay here with the controls ready to speed speed speed to the next galaxy miranda miranda you re here with me
yes larry here
didn lose you oh my beautiful love thought lost you
am here larry no can see what he sees no don don think of it
liar liar deceiver you re not alone you brought it with you it here it here you brought it with you liar liar liar he tries to strangle miranda don love her don love her she ll kill you if you love her love you miranda marvick collapses
he dead jim captain log stardate 5630 as result of larry marvick insane fears the enterprise lies derelict in uncharted space we have no way to determine our position in relation to the galaxy we are in completely unknown void
where are we
we are evidently far outside our own galaxy judging from the lack of traceable reference points when we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five we apparently entered space-time continuum
have the autopsy report on marvick heart action stopped cause unknown respiration stopped cause unknown brain activity stopped cause shall go on
you mean he just simply died
mean he evidently could not live with what he saw
or what he felt damage report scotty
we need some repairs sir but the ship is intact
position report mister spock
impossible to calculate we lack data to analyse our instruments appear to be functioning normally but what they tell us makes no sense our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy
then we should be able to navigate back
unfortunately we lack reference points on which to plot return course we experienced extreme sensory distortion and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed and we cannot re-cross the barrier using sub light speed
madman got us into this and it beginning to look as if only madman can get us out
an entertaining suggestion mister chekov but not very helpful kirk; there is someone else aboard who might be able to help us navigate the medusans have developed interstellar navigation to fine art could kollos function despite the sensory distortion
very possibly the medusan sensory system is radically different from ours perhaps for the purpose of this emergency might become kollos
explain
fusion mind-link to create double entity each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both we will function as one being
hazards
if the link is successful there will be tendency to lose separate identity necessary risk of course doctor jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link
don think she ll want anyone to intrude in the kind of rapport she has with kollos
doctor jones has shown reluctance every time ve asked to converse with kollos in some ways she is still most human captain particularly in the depth of her jealousy
could confine her to quarters
not sufficient her telepathic powers are formidable if it is at all possible her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what am doing shall intrude
think that could be arranged it room with lots of flowers in bloom
may be sentimental but this is my favourite place earth
ve never been to earth what lovely flowers may touch them
certainly
they have no scent
try these she sniffs at rose and pricks her finger
let me see it just thorn was hoping to make you forget about this today
it doesn hurt anymore
you mustn blame yourself because marvick loved you
didn want his love couldn return it
but someday you will want human love and companionship
shall tell you what human companionship means to me struggle defence against the emotions of others at times the emotions burst in on me hatred desire envy pity pity is the worst of all agree with the vulcans violent emotion is kind of insanity spock visor in hand is making his way along corridor
are you willing to spend the rest of your life with the medusans in order to avoid human emotion
perhaps
meeting of minds is all very well but what about love miranda you re young attractive and human sooner or later no matter how beautiful their minds are you re going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself someone who isn ugly
ugly what is ugly who is to say whether kollos is too ugly to bear or too beautiful to bear
miranda meant no insult please here we are among the roses very romantic setting wish there were moonlight too moonlight would suit you very well he moves in for the usual kiss but gets held off
see you re very complicated man spock enters kollos quarters
kollos no you mustn let him
miranda don
let me go you have no idea what dangerous thing spock is planning we must stop him let me go they leave together miranda meets spock coming out of kollos quarters
the enterprise is at stake it is not possible for you to be involved
why ve already committed myself to mind-link when kollos and reach the medusan vessel why put yourself in jeopardy
this is not duty that you can assume am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine but there more important factor the object is to pilot this ship that is something you cannot do
then teach me to operate the ship can memorise instantly
now wait minute realise that you can do almost anything sighted person can do but you can pilot starship
what
fascinating
sorry miranda but you must be realistic you are blind and there are some things you simply cannot do spock touches the decorated over-dress she always wears
evidently highly sophisticated sensor web my compliments to you and to your dressmaker
yes of course it the only reasonable explanation you can see and kollos can hurt you
an elegant solution but fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness doctor jones
think understand you said it pity is the worst of all
pity which hate do you think you can gather more information with your eyes than can with my sensors could play tennis with you captain kirk might even beat you am standing exactly one metre four centimetres from the door can you judge distance that accurately can even tell you how fast your heart is beating
no that won be necessary mister spock will make the mind-link no other decision is possible
no won let you
please do not fight us like this doctor jones appeal to you as colleague do not oppose us
no
if we can persuade you there is someone who can you ll have to take this up with kollos for your own sake she goes into kollos quarters
bones why hadn you told me
she would have told you herself if she had wanted you to know respect her privacy
yes there great deal to respect about that lady there scream then miranda comes out of the room calm and composed
it seems have no choice but to obey you captain log supplementary our one chance to return to our own galaxy is dependent upon the navigational skills of the medusan ambassador with that end in view kollos has been brought to the bridge and placed behind protective shield kollos is by spock station and spock is wearing visor the lid opens then spock comes out from behind the shield and takes off the visor
this is delightful know you all of you james kirk captain and friend for many years and leonard mccoy also of long acquaintance and uhura whose name means freedom she walks in beauty like the night
that not spock
are you surprised to find that ve read byron doctor
that spock
am addressing the ambassador
in part that is part of us is known to you as kollos ah miranda there you are brave new world that has such creatures in it
tis new to thee
my world is next for us captain kirk speak for all of us you call medusans am sorry for the trouble ve brought to your ship
we don hold you to blame for what happened and thank you now for your help
and now to the business at hand with your permission captain
yes mister sulu release the helm to mister spock
aye sir
co-ordination is completed
then go ahead mister spock
warp one in six seconds five four three two one zero the engines come to life and the enterprise glides back through the barrier
position report please mister chekov
our position our position is so close to the point where we entered the void the difference isn worth mentioning bull s-eye mister spock
thank you mister chekov manoeuvre completed captain
take over mister sulu thank you ambassador mister chekov plot new course
the new headings will be plotted in minute sir
how compact your bodies are and what variety of senses you have this thing you call language though most remarkable you depend on it for so very much but is any one of you really its master but most of all the aloneness you are so alone you live out your lives in this shell of flesh self-contained separate how lonely you are how terribly lonely
ambassador you must dissolve the link
so soon
there must be no delay
you re wise captain spock goes back behind the shield and the lid opens then sulu notices the visor still on the helm console
captain
spock don look cover your eyes spock screams
don move
but jim
no one is to move spock are you all right spock backs away from kollos anguish all over his face kirk; spock it all right you re safe with us now spock then attacks everyone within reach kirk manages to get the phaser from fallen security guard and stun his first officer
he hardly breathing help me get him to sickbay inside miranda is performing sort of mind meld on the unconscious spock she has removed her sensor net dress
unless miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us we will lose spock
pacing vulcan mind techniques they seem so untrustworthy now that spock life is at stake
her knowledge of them may be the only thing that could save spock sanity perhaps even his life
but does she want to she been in there so long
there nothing else to be done
she tried to help marvick marvick is dead
that different marvick loved her
and spock is her rival is that any better even spock felt the violence of her jealousy
but they weren rivals in love jim you shouldn go in there
whatever happens bones don interfere
who is it doctor mccoy who there
captain kirk
have no news for you captain
no change
only that his life processes are ebbing
what are you doing about it
why what can of course
which doesn seem to be much
no doubt you think can wake him with kiss
it worth try isn it after all he not machine
but he is vulcan
only half the other half is human far more human than you apparently
face reality captain his mind has gone down almost too far even for me to reach
if you don reach him soon he ll die but that what you want isn it
that lie
oh yes you want him to die what did you do to him on the bridge did you make him forget to put the visor over his eyes
you re insane
yes you know your rival don you you couldn keep him from making mind-link with kollos something you couldn do yourself with my words ll make you hear such ugliness as spock saw when he looked at kollos with his naked eyes the ugliness is within you
that lie liar
your desire to see kollos is madness you can never see him never but spock saw kollos and for that he must die
sadistic filthy liar
the smell of hatred the stench of jealousy permeates you why don you strangle him while he lies there
don say anymore please
kollos knows what in your heart you can lie to yourself but you can lie to kollos
please go away
what you say to her
maybe too much
what she doing in there
you may be right bones maybe shouldn have gone in she was blind really blind really in the dark and if he dies if he dies how do know that didn kill him how do know that she can stand to hear the truth
now spock this is to the death or to life for both of us she touches his forehead then we get distorted images of what spock saw while he was insane finally he opens his eyes and connects with miranda the door opens and spock staggers in from the corridor
spock
you look like you ve paid visit to the devil himself
miranda kirk steps out into the corridor but it is empty kollos is on the transporter pad in his box miranda is wearing her sensor net again spock is advertising the idic again
you have what you wanted most
am one with kollos
well truly sorry that you re leaving goodbye mccoy leaves
we come to the end of an eventful trip captain
didn think you even talk to me
well have you to thank for my future your words enabled me to see
miranda good luck health have something for you red rose
suppose it has thorns
never met rose that didn
to spock know now the great joy you felt when you joined minds with kollos
rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement
understand mister spock the glory of creation is in its infinite diversity
and the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty miranda gets on the transporter pad
peace and long life spock
live long and prosper miranda
peace spock puts on the visor to beam kollos and miranda away kirk just watches then leaves
stardate 4372 on top-secret diplomatic mission the enterprise has entered the tellun star system maintaining communications blackout we have taken aboard petri ambassador from troyius the outer planet and are now approaching the inner planet elas
some desk-bound starfleet bureaucrat cut these cloak-and-dagger orders
aye but why the secrecy this star system under federation control
it in border area mister scott the klingons also claim jurisdiction
from what ve seen it not worth fighting about why are we here captain
my orders are to co-operate with ambassador petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here
scotty scott presses the intercom button kirk here what is it to beam aboard and they demand an explanation for the delay
demand what delay all right beam them aboard
sounds typical of the elasians the scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant
that just the negative part mister spock ve been over those records now the women they re supposed to be something very special they re supposed to have kind of subtle mystical power that drives men wild the ambassador is skinny humanoid with orange hair and grass green skin
ambassador petri would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about
that must wait until the dohlman is aboard
dohlman what the devil is dohlman
the thing most feared and hated by my people our most deadly enemy three burly men are beamed aboard they draw their weapons
welcome am petri ambassador of troyius
captain kirk this ship is under my command
there troyian here must know that all is secure before the dohlman is brought on board
this ship is secure and we re prepared for any hostile acts energise the elasians get down on one knee
do honour to the dohlman of elas petri kneels
glory to elaan dohlman of elas woman in little more than high-necked bathing suit is beamed aboard she is beautiful but slightly sullen the enterprise officers kneel
you may stand
body armour nuclear weapons
not without precedent captain remember that
permission to speak was not given
you rule this ship
am the first officer this is captain james kirk
your glory am petri in the name of my people
your mission is known to us captain kirk you have now permission to show us to our quarters
well now just moment there going to have to be some kind of understanding
please
my first officer mister spock will show you to your quarters ambassador like to speak to you
you have not been dismissed
may have your permission to go
you are now dismissed
why thank you ambassador
ambassador think it time you told me what going on
that creature elaan is to be the wife of our ruler to bring peace our two warring planets now possess the capability of mutual destruction some method of co-existence must be found
see so we go back to troyius
yes but slowly captain will need time before we reach there she must be taught civilised manners in her present condition my people would never accept her
and you are to be her teacher
those are my orders must ask you and your crew to respect or at least tolerate their arrogance friction must be kept at minimum
yes that can understand
another thing you should understand captain you have as much at stake as have your superiors made the statement that failure of this mission would be as catastrophic for federation planning as it would be for our two planets to gain peace at the price of accepting such queen is no victory will take her the official gifts bear perhaps that will soften her mood
mister chekov lay in course for troyius mister sulu impulse drive speed factor point zero three seven
impulse drive captain
yes that correct mister sulu sublight factor point zero three seven
aye aye sir
captain you ll not be using the warp drive all the way on impulse that ll take great deal of time
you in hurry mister scott
no spock enters
captain the dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided
what the matter with them mister spock
do not know but all the elasians seem most irrational
gave up my quarters because
yes appreciate your sacrifice lieutenant uhura ll talk to her myself elaan is throwing slippers at petri
swine take back your gifts
your glory these are your wedding slippers
your ruler cannot buy the favours of the dohlman of elas
this sky blue thing this is your wedding dress gift from the bridegroom mother
want nothing of his
this this is the most prized of royal jewels for your lovely neck kirk enters
would strangle if was to put the gift of troyian dog around my neck kryton by whose permission did he enter
he came in answer to your summons
understand you re not happy with your quarters
quarters throws something that breaks
yes not happy at all
am soft troyian fawn to need pillows to sit on and these ridiculous female trappings they are an offense to my eyes
my communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you would find it satisfactory
do not find them so and find him even less satisfactory must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador aboard your ship
explained to her glory that her council of nobles and the troyius tribunal jointly agreed that should instruct pause make her acquainted with the customs and manners of our people
kryton remove him and take that garbage with you petri picks up the wedding dress and necklace box and leaves with kryton
he dares to suggest that adopt the servile manners of his people
your glory doesn seem to be responding to instruction
will never forgive the council for putting me through this torture were you responding to my demand for better quarters
there are none better suggest you make do with these
you suggest
there are no more available but if that the only way you can get gratification ll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects
will not be humiliated
then act in civilised fashion
did not give you permission to leave
didn ask for any
captain wish to contact my government cannot fulfil my mission it would be an insult to our ruler to bring this incorrigible monster as bride
ambassador this is supposed to be peaceful mission
there cannot be peace between us we have deluded ourselves captain when am near them do not want peace want to kill them
you re as bad as she is it not required that you like each other just do your job
job the job is impossible we cannot make peace with people we detest
stop trying to kill each other then worry about being friendly
but if she won listen to me
then make her listen ambassador use different approach stop being so diplomatic she respects strength go in strong
at first it appeared to be sensor ghost but ve run checks on all the instrumentation all the equipment is functioning perfectly
hydrogen cloud reflection
none in this area nothing that would account for it the ghost appears intermittently
speculation
none captain insufficient data
it not an instrument malfunction it not reflection from natural phenomenon spaceship
kirk here
captain know what you said about showing respect but must have these persons fool around with my equipment
hang on scotty be pleasant no matter how much it hurts ll be right down
we re only running on impulse engines now ordinarily we use the warp engines exclusively
well suppose lassie that even our impulse engines must seem fast compared to your nuclear propulsion units
we are interested in how the ship is used in combat not in what drives it engines are for mechanics and menials
menials without engines there be no fighting or
mister scott wish you had told me you wanted tour of the engineering department
do we not have the freedom of this ship we have granted your crew the permission not to kneel in our presence what else do you want
courtesy remember
courtesy is not for inferiors
courtesy is for everyone around here and you ll find you won be able to exist on troyius without it mister scott our chief engineer has shown you his engineering department that courtesy you respond by saying thank you the diminutive firecracker stalks away with her bodyguards
kirk here
on my way
lost contact now
captain we had momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was spaceship
whose
no data yet
captain distant bearing sir mark seven three point five
main screen extreme magnification klingon ship appears in view
our ghost has materialised
klingon warship after few moments any change mister spock
negative captain the klingon ship has simply moved into contact range she is pacing us precisely matching our sublight speed and on parallel course
kirk here what is it
on my way
captain it ambassador petri they refuse to explain what happening but
her glory has not summoned you elaan comes out of her room
kryton remove that troyian pig petri is lying on the floor with dagger in his back
it was deep wound jim he lost lot of blood but he ll recover
if recover it will be no thanks to you captain
said talk with her not fight with her
should ve known better than to talk to her unarmed but you forced me hold you responsible for this
well ve heard of reluctant brides but this is ridiculous
captain kirk may speak with you sir
yes certainly
message just came from starfleet command it was class-a security and scrambled put it through the decoder
what was it
the federation high commissioner is on his way to troyius to attend the royal wedding
ambassador if elasian women are that vicious why are men so overwhelmingly attracted to them mean what magic do they possess
it not magic it biochemical man whose flesh is once touched by the tears of woman of elas has his heart enslaved forever
ambassador there an added complication the federation high commissioner will be attending the wedding
the fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom ambassador
there will be no wedding would not have our ruler marry that monster if the entire galaxy depended on it and will have nothing further to do with you
not asking you to have anything to do with me do your job with her how long before he on his feet
it ll be few days week at least jim
here you put me captain here will stay have nothing further to say to you she is dining like tudor royal ripping poultry apart with her hands
so ambassador petri is going to recover that is too bad you have delivered your message now you may go
nothing would please me more your glory but your impetuous nature
your troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission so stabbed him just to be troyian is enough
you elasians pride yourselves on being warrior people you must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders my orders are to take you to troyius to be married and to see that you learn troyian customs
despise troyians any contact with them makes me feel soiled
it been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other
it not in my experience
well we re still faced with the same problem
problem
yes the problem of your indoctrination to troyian customs and manners
have eliminated that problem
you have eliminated the teacher the problem still remains
oh and how do we solve the problem
by giving you new teacher
tell me what can you teach me
table manners for one thing this is plate it contains food this is knife it cuts the food this is glass
leave me
like it or not you re going to learn what you ve been ordered to learn
you will return me to elas immediately
that impossible
everything order is possible
that the first problem we re going to work on then we ll get you ready to go to troyius
will not go to troyius will not be mated to troyian and will not be humiliated and will not be given to green pig as bribe to stop war
you enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being dohlman then be worthy of them if you don want the obligations that go along with the title then give it up
nobody speaks to me that way
that another one of your problems nobody told you that you re an uncivilized savage vicious child in woman body an arrogant monster elaan slaps kirk so he slaps her back
that no way to treat someone who telling you the truth he turns to leave she takes knife from her sleeve and throws it it just misses him and sticks in the wall
tomorrow lesson will be on courtesy
lieutenant open up the hailing frequency identify us and ask the klingon his intentions
aye sir meanwhile kryton is sneaking around in engineering and messing with the dilithium crystals
captain no response from the klingon vessel on any channel
see all right lieutenant monitor all frequencies phaser crews stand by maintain yellow alert
what are you doing kryton kills the red-shirt and hides his body then continues with his sabotage kirk is prevented from entering elaan quarters
no one may enter the dohlman presence
where kryton
on business no one may enter the dohlman presence
will you tell her glory that captain kirk requests the honour of visit
the dohlman has promised ll be whipped to death if let captain kirk pass through that door they push kirk away so spock stuns them with phaser
thank you mister spock when they wake up take them to security holding
captain your analysis of the situation was flawless anticipating that she would deny you admittance however the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me
mister spock the women on your planet are logical that the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim elaan takes another swing at kirk so he forces her back down onto the bed
you dare touch member of the royal family
only in self-defence now are you going to behave or not
the penalty is death for what you are doing
we re not on elas we re on my starship command here she bites his hand and runs into the bathroom
you are warned captain never to touch me again
if touch you again your glory it ll be to administer an ancient earth custom called spanking form of punishment administered to spoiled brats
you have my leave to go
you forget your glory we haven started your lesson in courtesy
you can teach me nothing captain if have to stay here for ten light years will not be soiled by any contact with you
very well ll send in mister spock or doctor mccoy either way you re going to be properly prepared for troyius as ordered by councils rulers and bureaucrats she comes back out
captain there is one thing you can teach me
no no you were right the first time there nothing can teach you there nothing you do not know
don know how to make people like me don want everybody to hate me
well it not it not that people hate you it just that people don like to be treated as though they don exist he wipes tear from her face
it er gotten very er something must ve gone wrong with the ventilation system
captain
pardon me your glory there will be short recess
captain they kiss
captain that ancient earth custom called spanking what is it
it er it er we ll talk about it later he pulls her into passionate embrace in engineering kryton finishes his task and opens communicator light flashes on uhura panel
bridge to captain kirk mister spock getting
have it on my sensor lieutenant
bridge to captain kirk come in please captain kirk please answer
oh captain picking up transmission from inside the enterprise it on tight beam aimed at the klingon vessel
inside the enterprise can you pinpoint it from the engineering section
security to engineering intruder alert security alert to all decks kirk out he leaves elaan on the bed with smug smile on her face kryton has been caught
nobody saw him but that devil sneaked back in here some way watson must ve caught him and he was killed for it he had this looks like some sort of transmitter
it klingon bones
neck snapped clean
what kind of signal did you send the klingon ship
captain you must know will tell you nothing our interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you are even capable of
yes aware you re trained to resist any form of physical torture kirk to spock
mister spock it was kryton transmitting he refuses to talk ll need you for the vulcan mind meld kryton grabs security guard phaser and vapourises himself
captain sorry he seemed
what was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it scotty he didn come into engineering just to use the transmitter want you to check every relay you ve got
captain you must realise the time
don waste the time telling me about it get to it
aye
kryton was of noble family he loved me and wanted to marry me he was furious when he heard of the announcement of the wedding plans
he sold out to the klingons because of jealousy
probably but why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak about us
there klingon warship out there what their involvement surely all of this isn because they want to stop marriage
we should welcome their help
elaan elaan two planets an entire star system stability depends on it we have duty to forget what happened
could you do that could you give me to another man
my orders and yours say that you belong to another man what happened what happened was an accident
it was no accident chose you and you chose me have plan with this ship you could completely obliterate troyius then there will be no need for the marriage and in gratitude my people will give you the complete rule of this system
what kind of mind could think of such thing
he troyian they kiss and the doorbell buzzes
you cannot resist my love my love the door opens and mccoy and spock see the lovers in their close embrace
may we see you moment
jim jim may we please have word with you
captain are you all right
did she cry jim
what
did she cry did her tears touch you at any time kirk looks at his hand
oh we re in trouble now listen jim petri told christine that the elasian women have sort of biochemical substance in their tears that acts like super love potion and according to him it doesn wear off
it is true then captain
it true bones you ve got to find me an antidote
ll try but ll need tests and
captain here toward us at warp speed
on my way battle stations
phasers stand by
phasers ready sir
their speed is better than warp six captain
mister chekov lay in course to take us out of this star system if they want to fight let get some manoeuvering room
course computed sir
laid in captain
all right ahead warp factor two
belay that order what is it scotty
the anti-matter pods are rigged to blow up the moment we go into warp drive
scotty that bomb he planted can you dismantle it
not without being blown halfway across the galaxy
give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive and find solution to the bomb kirk out mister sulu stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly she ll be sluggish on response elaan enters the bridge kirk sees her during sulu countdown
aye sir one hundred thousand kilometres ninety eighty
phaser crews stand by to fire on command
sixty
ready
fifty
hold your fire
she passed us without firing shot
don think they meant to attack us we were very fortunate this time
yes their tactics are quite clear now mister spock they were trying to make us cut in warp drive that way we have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the federation very neat
very but why do the klingons consider the possession of this system so vital
yes very good question mister spock
have another question captain is not the bridge the wrong place for the dohlman at time like this
ll be the judge yes you re quite right thank you mister spock to elaan want you to go to sickbay it the best protected part of the ship
want to be by your side
your presence here is interfering with my efficiency my ability to protect you mister spock you have the conn
deck five
love you have chosen you and still don understand why you didn fight the klingon
if can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running ll gladly do that
and that mission is to take me to troyius
yes
would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man and never see you again
yes elaan
are you happy at the prospect
no
kirk here
ve got bad news captain the entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused no chance of repair
no chance of restoring warp drive enough power to fire our weapons
kirk out elaan have to go back to the bridge please you must go to sickbay
yes my love
test number twenty four colladium trioxide in algobarium solution
results also negative
doctor there is no antidote to the poison of elasian tears the men of elas have tried desperately for centuries to dispel its power you re wasting your time doctor
it is my time to waste ambassador
doctor the captain asked me to come here for safety
safety what is your estimate of our chances for survival doctor
that is the captain responsibility ambassador
captain message from the klingon ship they re ordering us to stand by for boarding or be destroyed
they demand an immediate reply
they re trying to force fight scotty what our energy status
ninety three percent of impulse power sir
we can still manoeuvre warp-driven starship
our shields will hold for few passes but without the matter-antimatter reactor we ve no chance captain can you not call starfleet on this emergency
and let the klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines
help could not arrive before the enterprise would be destroyed
now that we are all about to die ask you once again to accept this necklace and to wear it as token of respect for the desperate wishes of your people and mine for peace
that all you men of other worlds can speak of duty and responsibility
we ll stall for time proceed on course and hope the klingons can be bluffed or that they re not prepared for general war open hailing frequency
frequency open sir
this is captain james kirk of the uss enterprise on federation business our mission is peaceful but we re not prepared to accept any interference destroyed
say our strategy wasn totally effective
captain the klingon ship is closing on an intercept course five hundred thousand kilometres deflector shields up
scotty can you give me partial power on the phaser banks elaan enters in the blue wedding dress and wearing the necklace
three hundred thousand kilometres
told you to stay in sickbay
want to die with you
we re not going to die now get off the bridge
one hundred thousand kilometres weapons fire hits the enterprise
he passed us all shields held
mister sulu bring her to one four three mark two keep our forward shields to him
here he comes again sir
stay with the controls keep our forward shields to him
better than warp seven
hard over sulu bring her around he going for our flank another disruptor hit sulu
sorry captain she won respond fast enough on impulse
he past us again damage to number four shield
how bad
it will not withstand another full charge captain getting some very peculiar energy readings
he paralleling us again he seems to have broken off the attack
what sort of readings mister spock
she is the source
elaan
the necklace
what kind of jewels are in this
they call them radans the necklace is supposed to bring you luck it is of little value they are common stones
these are common stones scans them see captain here and here
common stones now see why the klingons are interested in this system may have this
if can be of any help of course
you may have just saved our lives mister spock do you think scotty could make use of dilithium crystals
no doubt captain
he coming in again sir
mister sulu prepare on my order to turn quickly to port try and protect the number four shield
aye sir
now sulu hard a-port another disrupter hit
shields holding but weakened sir
captain message coming in extremely low your shields buckling this is your last chance to surrender
captain number four shield just collapsed impulse power down to thirty one percent
lieutenant uhura open hailing frequency
channel open sir
this is captain james kirk of the united spaceship enterprise may request your terms for surrender immediate
scotty your estimate
we re fitting it now sir but we ll have to run few tests to make sure
test it in combat
captain these are crude crystals there is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow effectively as
let me know when it in place open hailing frequency
hailing frequency open sir
this is the enterprise will you guarantee the safety of our passenger the dohlman from elas
captain he starting his run
it in place sir but can answer for what happens
you and spock get up here sulu prepare for warp manoeuvres
aye sir
chekov arm photon torpedoes
photon torpedoes ready
warp power to the shields captain
negative his sensors will pick up our power increase the more helpless he thinks we are the closer he ll come as he passes want to cut in warp drive we ll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear
aye sir
mister chekov give him full spread of photon torpedoes
aye captain scott and spock enter
one hundred thousand kilometres
scotty stand by to cut in warp drive
fluctuation it the shape of the crystals was afraid of that
seventy five seventy sixty fifty
fire at minimum range
forty
she won steady down
thirty
warp in scotty full power to shields the klingons fire
warp factor two bring us to course one four eight mark three the klingons fire again
chekov photon torpedoes fire
aye sir six torpedoes go but not all hit the klingons
direct hit amidships by photon torpedo
damage to klingon number three shield number four shield obliterated loss of manoeuvre power
he badly damaged captain continuing away at reduced speed
secure from general quarters well done mister sulu scotty
but don understand you you mean you won pursue and finish him off
no mister sulu resume course for troyius
aye aye sir kirk is already there when petri and elaan enter her bodyguards trailing behind
you will not beam down for the ceremony
no
want you to have this as personal memento have learned that on troyius they do not wear such things remember me she hands over her dagger
have no choice
nor have have only responsibilities and obligations goodbye
goodbye energise
to spock it stabilised now mccoy enters
spock ve isolated the biochemical substance of the elasian tears it kind of an infection and think ve found an antidote
you are too late doctor the captain has found his own antidote
are you out of your vulcan mind do you know how long ve worked on
the antidote to woman of elas doctor is starship the enterprise infected the captain long before the dohlman did
mister sulu prepare to take us out of orbit
well doubt seriously if there any kind of an antidote for the enterprise
in this particular instance doctor agree with you
ahead warp factor two captain log stardate 5554 the enterprise has been ordered to survey new planet recently discovered at the periphery of the galaxy green sky extraordinarily elegant curved rock formations buildings with vegetation growing on them
life readings are confused sir can decipher them
there is something else captain getting reading of some kind of power from that building sulu glances up the sun flashes and miniature purple tree thing is at his feet
well now what this captain captain
what is it mister sulu
you re going to have to see this yourself sir as he walks off the plant gets up and follows him
what is that thing
it mobile plant when it stops it roots bore back into the ground they re all over the place think it likes me
we always encourage our officers to make friends with the natives
captain the power reading now includes an electronic probe we are being scanned
phasers on stun stay alert mister sulu stay here sulu picks up his new friend then drops it in pain
ow must have been thorn elegant smooth alien semi-organic design with flashing lights on two wall panels
the probe originates in this wall as does an incredibly powerful force shield it appears to be an amalgam of devices designed to defend and protect the city and this building in particular
jim picking up humanoid reading of incredible strength it as if he sulu is face down on the grass
he been poisoned unknown toxin
can you help him
can get correlation with any known poison
maybe the ship medical computers
he got about one minute to live unless can find an answer maybe dylovene no good takes too much time to work if it does work
maybe stronger shot
that won be necessary four green tentacled aliens with eyes on stalks and medallions around their necks are standing there think asparagus
who are you
am called agmar believe we can help
are you getting reading on them
moment captain the results are unclear
now just minute can let you whatever you are inject him with some alien dew drop
to wait is to assure your friend death must proceed
bones let them help
captain these beings are of botanical origin
intelligent plants
so it would seem
it is an antidote quickly absorbed he should begin to respond momentarily
thank you
welcome to the planet phylos
captain james kirk mister spock doctor mccoy and mister sulu you seem to have been expecting us
our instruments have tracked and scanned you we did not wish to reveal ourselves immediately we are peaceful race and we have fear of aliens
what happened to him
he was bitten by the retlaw plant it is deadly only if unattended this episode was written by walter koenig by the way walter/retlaw get it
your medication worked quickly
minor achievement
minor our science doesn have anything that works that fast yours must be incredible the toxin level is decreasing fast body readings up to normal how is it you knew your antidote would work on human
there have been humanoid aliens here before
your method of communication
voder or translator most efficient the medallion
sorry agmar but don like puzzles where are the rest of your people
come will show you agmar opens one of the inner doors to reveal long corridor lined with giants
our people
nerve tissue mass density is exceptionally high readings indicate the beings used almost seventy percent of their brains very high ratio
your ancestors
no only the generation before us
then what happened
human came he brought sickness and death but he also worked to save us from his disease
there are evidences of gram-positive bacteria it carried by humanoids without ill effect but staphylococcus strains don seem to be native to this planet it must have been like plague
we had no way of knowing what was happening
you were alive then
very young purple pterodactyl with tendrils for legs flies overhead
plant life captain primitive and aggressive kirk ducks and tries his phaser nothing
they won work on any setting sir
there is weapons deactivator in effect here your destructive machines will have no effect
think it after you jim
kirk to enterprise the pterodactyl grabs him and he drops the communicator more of the flying plants arrive
captain the rest of the party are grabbed
what do you think they ll do with us sir
something tells me we ve just been used as diversionary tactic look they fly away with spock
sorry captain kirk but there was no other way
what are you talking about where have they taken spock
he has been chosen to serve greater cause the master has searched many years to find specimen like spock mccoy kirk and sulu are released and now all the worlds of the galaxy will share in the beauty of peace and harmony kirk grabs agmar
so help me if you don tell me where spock has been taken
the master praise to the master the master our saviour saviour our master giant man has arrived
another plant
no definitely human jim
am doctor stavos keniclius five welcome to phylos captain kirk
where is spock
he is mine the essence of him is mine return to your ship here is your communicator go back to your ship
not without my first officer
am sorry captain you will leave now or suffer the consequences the pterodactyls return
kirk to enterprise beam us up scotty captain log stardate 5554 we have come upon one of the most fascinating discoveries we have ever seen plant life of extraordinary intelligence and technology however they have captured mister spock apparently under the orders of human named keniclius lieutenant uhura is trying to locate any reference to such man in order to unravel the mystery of this giant human
anything mister sulu
we haven been able to pick up any human life form readings sir spock and keniclius must be somewhere our sensors can penetrate
what about the phylosians
had to adjust for the fact that they re plant life forms we re registering the lesser ones like the swoopers in abundance no sign of agmar and the other four
agmar said something about weapons deactivator mister sulu lock ship phasers on that laboratory building use wide area stun setting
aye sir
lieutenant uhura how are you coming with that information on keniclius
nothing current captain may have found something in the history banks ll have it in moment
keep trying lieutenant
phasers locked on and ready sir
fire phasers
firing no effect captain phaser stun was neutralized at distance of one thousand metres above the area
which means our weapons are useless and we have no alternative but to go back down there and try to rescue spock without them
hate to resort to clubs and knives
there may be something more effective mister sulu kirk to engineering scotty
how that special equipment coming along
my engineers are working on it now sir you ll have it within the hour
have the information now sir ll put it on the main screen
thank you lieutenant bones
one of my great great granddaddies way back had the finest garden in the south had to scramble around little bit to find the materials but ve got his recipe brewing now
working from earth history file stavos keniclius earth scientist period eugenics wars the image on the screen does appear to be the giant wearing lab coat with nice array of pens in the pocket
planned to clone perfect specimen prototype into master race concept considered anti-humanistic banned from community disappeared no evidence of death no further data
there used to be story about modern diogenes wandering the galaxy looking for someone special
someone special perfect specimen perhaps yes ve heard it too
it couldn be keniclius he be over two hundred and fifty years old
not if he cloned new copy of himself every so often to carry on the search remember he said he was keniclius five
it seems incredible that man could take few cells from his body and reproduce himself from them time after time but that seems to be exactly what we re dealing with in the giant human keniclius
hope these things work
well the equipment guaranteed but have my doubts about the stuff inside strange way to handle aliens
these are strange aliens we re fighting scotty as soon as we beam down want you to leave orbit if they think we ve gone they won be scanning the surface give us thirty minutes
aye sir but don like it
neither do but it appears to be necessary energise
no indication of scan don think they know we re here
let go some swoopers are around
not sure can take too much of this
they re almost mindless doctor they seem to attack primarily as reflex action it clear now by the buildings
can believe it
incredible in hangar phylosian is pulling ivy off row of spaceships
looks like they re getting ready to go on trip
but where to what purpose the number of ships indicates mass migration or invasion
agmar said they were peaceful people
sure they are now but what about before
you could have point bones those ships the city the phylosians built technology possibly greater than we animal species did
the ships look like they never got off the ground could be the disease keniclius accidentally brought here swept the planet before they could do whatever they were going to do
any indication of keniclius or spock
no sir only the phylosians
well followers can be led let hope we can be as persuasive as keniclius kirk grabs agmar
agmar we don want to hurt you but we must have spock back
do not think that is possible the vulcan-human blend of wisdom sense of order durability and strength is the finest the master has ever found we are pleased spock will carry on our work
carry on your work
we are the last of dying people captain once we had great mission then disease decimated us we few are the frail remnant of what survived our spore cells have been destroyed there will be no more of our kind
what if something happens to spock or the master
there will always be master but come you are worried about your friend will show you he is safe and in good hands
just like that captain
so it would appear mister sulu all the same keep that bag handy they go to an area surrounded by trees
the way is though here gentlemen he presses control and the ground lowers them down into tunnel
we sprang from the soil captain these tunnels were once part of our home this will serve to illuminate our way the ground they were standing on above now carries them along
no wonder we couldn find spock the walls are six hundred times denser than lead in addition to the surface force field
did you hear something
what
not sure
not much further now captain
there it is again flapping sound it goes dark agmar
use the belt lights
they don operate agmar swoopers shriek and attack
run we ve got to find some light we can do anything unless we can see what we re fighting don stop try to stay together
jim up ahead light at the end of the tunnel
see it see it keep going they emerge in lab of some sort spock is lying in glass case
he dying something happened to his brain electrical activity decreasing
it too late captain kirk in few minutes your friend will be gone but as keniclius one lives on in each of his clones so will mister spock behold gentlemen the dawning of new era the salvation of galaxy spock two giant vulcan looms over them
get ready the party put face masks on themselves and the recumbent spock as swoopers screech in then kirk and sulu fire mccoy recipe filling the air with it the swoopers fall the giants leave
captain out the chemical sprayer is empty
mine too jim
wait listen
maybe they re waiting for the mist to clear it clears well how about that great granddaddy weed spray still works
never mind that we ve got to get spock out of here before keniclius returns scott should have the enterprise back by now kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise nothing must be these blasted walls again kirk to enterprise
it no use jim he ll be dead in few minutes his mind is gone he no longer thinks this machine has drained his mind somehow
more than just drained it been transferred relocated into the mechanism itself can duplicate exact physiological structure cannot duplicate that which is learned just as my predecessor transferred his knowledge to me through his apparatus have done that with mister spock and the first of his clones
you talk about creating life with your clones but you have to murder to do it picks up spock come on giant spock blocks their way
out of my way mister that an order
don think he understands his mind is still trying to assimilate all the knowledge it been fed
keep trying lieutenant we ve got to make contact with the captain
it no use mister scott can get through
except for environmental systems want the entire power load of this ship redirected into tight beam transmission if we can break through the shielding we can reach the captain
mister scott you re risking total drain of our dilithium crystals to maintain communication we would have to burn out all our reserves
and don know it lass but we must speak to the captain the giant spock frowns
he coming out of it jim he becoming conscious and aware
spock what is the logic in letting man die for the sake of creating his duplicate explain it to me sir explain it to me
all power sources locked in mister scott
then throw the switch lieutenant
vulcans do not condone the meaningless death of any being spock death is meaningless if it is only to create giant version of himself
it is not just duplicate he will be the beginning of master race he interrupted by static
that our ship calling spock you answer them
spock is slipping away there isn much time left
sure we re getting through but they re not acknowledging
keep trying
mister scott we re near the drain point on the dilithium crystals now our reserves
keep trying
commander spock here located more information about keniclius
had the library computer check out all known writings by keniclius they are obscure but there is recurring theme in his later essays about using his master race as peace-keeping force throughout the galaxy perfect specimen have to sign off we ve reached power drain threshold
that what call close mister scott
let hope it was information they could use
all this has been waste keniclius there been peace in the federation for over one hundred years
that is lie what about the eugenics wars the galactic wars what of the depredations of the romulans the klingons and the kzinti an army of spock duplicates is necessary to subdue them
you re the fifth keniclius what makes you so sure what you believe is truth isn just old news your predecessors could have been out of touch with our advances for two centuries
the master always speaks the truth
can understand why you think keniclius is the master if he saved you from dying but why do you agree with his plan of super race
our fleet of ships which you saw was to be launched for the same purpose the master intends disease struck us before we could carry out our own plan to impose peace on galaxy that knew none
we already have peace in the federation it wasn imposed it was agreed upon you have no need of spock reverse the effects of that machine and let us take him
no the mould must be broken
jim spock almost gone
if you have spock mind you ll know the vulcan symbol called the idic
infinite diversity in infinite combinations symbolising the elements that create truth and beauty
could an army of spocks impose peace and phylosian philosophy on any other beings in defiance of the idic concept
do not believe so
reverse the machine keniclius
no our dream must not be allowed to die stavos smashes the glass box
murderer you ve killed spock
to persist in this behaviour captain is to negate the eloquence of your previous argument may suggest more constructive way the giant places huge finger on spock head
my mind to your mind my thoughts to your thoughts
the vulcan mind touch
am pleasantly surprised at your capacity for deductive reasoning captain when you are not being bellicose there appears to be no end to your arsenal of formidable talents
spock spock you old
and you needn worry captain kirk about master race there will be no militia no other spocks
but what of my work if all have lived for is already done if the times feared are gone what is to become of me there appears to be no reason why should continue to exist
would suggest doctor keniclius remain on phylos with my duplicate the concerted efforts of both scientists may yet achieve rebirth of the phylosian civilisation and enable them to contribute to the federation
my thoughts exactly mister spock
so one might assume mister spock
how does that sound to you keniclius to bring life is at least as important as bringing peace
would be honoured if will be allowed
ll report your work here think the federation will understand the two spocks salute each other
by the way mister sulu any chance of teaching me that body throw could come in handy sometime
don know sir it isn just physical you know you have to be inscrutable
inscrutable sulu you re the most scrutable man know captain log stardate 5143 while patrolling the edge of the romulan neutral zone the enterprise has changed course to assist one-man vessel which has fallen victim to meteor swarm sensors indicate the occupant is still alive
have you identified the vessel mister spock
yes captain but you may find it difficult to believe the vessel is registered to carter winston
that impossible spock carter winston been missing over five years kyle beams aboard fair-haired man
incredible it is him
carter winston
it seems you gentlemen know me
there are few in the federation who wouldn recognise your face sir captain james kirk commanding this vessel mister spock my first officer doctor mccoy senior medical officer
especially honoured to meet you mister winston my daughter was going to school on cerberus about ten years ago when the crop failure occurred the entire population would ve starved jim if winston here hadn used his personal fortune to bring in enough food and goods to carry them through the crisis
one of the many stories ve heard about you mister winston it an honour for all of us to have you aboard
there is one person aboard who should be especially happy to learn you are alive mister winston lieutenant anne nored of our security detail
my fiancee anne aboard this starship
we will notify her as soon as we ve verified your credentials mister winston if you have your identity tapes with you
spock of all the cold-blooded inhospitable requests ve ever heard
believe our regulations are quite clear doctor an immediate identity check and medical examination are standard requirement at this point
spock is right as usual bones
and understand of course my credentials captain the enterprise has rescued living legend the foremost space trader of our time carter winston has acquired dozen fortunes only to use his wealth time and again to assist federation colonies in times of need or disaster
library computer verify record tape on winston carter
working identification positive fingerprints positive voice print positive all licenses and registration in order
visual display of owner checks out it seems we ll have distinguished passenger with us for while
is there some problem doctor
this instrument seems little off ve never gotten quite this reading from human before
are you suggesting not quite human doctor
of course not anyway it just fraction off normal it probably the instrument they need to be recalibrated every so often chapel enters
the captain is inquiring if the examination is completed doctor
yes suppose so
and lieutenant nored is waiting to see mister winston once you ve certified his medical condition
well certainly don want to keep you any longer from your fiancee show her in mccoy and chapel leave and brunette enters
oh carter
sorry anne never thought we would meet again
carter what is it
when left on that last trip fully intended to come back and marry you but my ship was disabled and crashed on vendor told was lucky survived
but you did survive you re alive and we re together again
anne changed first there was surgery skin graft regrowth of bone after they put me together they assigned one of their people to me and he nursed me back to health
but you said you ve changed how don see any change
it over between us anne sorry can explain why but can marry you ever
take the conn mister spock ll be in my cabin completing the report on winston rescue
come
hope not intruding captain
no please come in mister winston
ve been down to examine my ship they stowed it in the shuttlebay
yes afraid it pretty badly damaged it hardly worth salvaging right now ve had our engineering officer mister scott examine it and make report it here somewhere he doesn think there anything left in your ship except scrap value behind his back carter winston crosses his arms and glows then turns into an orange creature poised on six slender tendrils it drapes tendril around kirk shoulder he falls unconscious and the thing places him gently on his bed then the creature turns into james kirk
well can find anything wrong with these instruments doctor they check out but the readings are still slightly off what about the rest of the tests on winston
well some are off and some aren it has to be our error come on we ll start from the beginning and this time we re going to find the answer kirk enters
weren you going to your cabin sir
mister sulu lay in direct course for ratar three
through the romulan neutral zone sir
that was the order helmsman
but sir if we re caught there the romulans can confiscate the ship the treaty
know the terms of the treaty mister sulu and believe you heard my order
aye aye sir
captain the extreme long-range sensors show something in the zone at this distance cannot determine precisely what it is it could be trading vessel like winston but it does not seem prudent to take the risk of trespass into the zone
mister spock ve spoken to winston on this at some length he has assured me it is absolutely vital to get to ratar three in the shortest possible time the survival of the entire planetary population may depend on it
an admirable mission captain but if we endanger our ship
wouldn have ordered it if didn feel it safe spock winston says his sensors detected no romulans when he came through the zone last week satisfied he telling the truth and his word is considered good isn it
that has been his reputation
course laid in sir
execute
on course sir
you have the conn mister spock ship log stardate 5148 first officer spock recording the captain course change has taken us deep into the romulan neutral zone kirk has woken up in his quarters
ll take the conn mister spock
is something wrong captain
not sure went down to my quarters to dictate the accident report and seem to have fallen asleep ve never done that before
perhaps you needed the rest we are on course through the neutral zone sir
the neutral zone we have no authorisation to enter it did you order course change spock
no sir you did
ridiculous no captain of the starfleet would do that unless it was matter of life and death
believe that was the reason you gave captain
that enough spock mister scott take the conn spock mister sulu plot course to take the enterprise out of the neutral zone at warp eight lieutenant ress put the ship on yellow alert
mister spock don remember giving those orders left the bridge went to my quarters and fell asleep that all
perhaps doctor mccoy should examine you captain
definitely ve become subject to blackouts possible danger to the safety of the ship can allow that
oh winston was just finishing the tests ran on you don think but winston has done his transformation into the alien sent him to sleep and has dragged the body away later
doctor mccoy
can help you
don know doctor just thought well have to talk to someone
oh now let me guess it you and carter winston he told me little about it when examined him
doctor what do do still love him
well sure he like to feel the same way about you anne but that may be impossible five years that long time people change
haven what can do
well if he asked you to forget him think you should try to do just that do you think he want to deceive you
oh no he the gentlest most thoughtful man ve ever known
yes but my dear if he doesn want you and he has asked you to forget him then suggest you take that as an honest concern for you and do it forget winston kirk and spock enter
thank you doctor ll consider your advice leaves
what can do for you captain
want complete medical examination bones something just happened
afraid ll have to make it later today captain have too many tests to process right now
carter winston
that one done tested out normal
are you sure there is no possibility you made an error
well there always that possibility ll go over them again if you like
no that won be necessary ll come by later for that examination let go spock
captain did you notice doctor mccoy reaction when asked him if there was any possibility he might have made an error
he said there always that possibility and that not like bones at all come on no one is there
there are not many places one could hide in here there groan from behind the door
must have taken little nap
doctor you are man of curious habits but have never known you to nap on the laboratory floor
there something wrong about this room he goes over to biobed
all right winston you can come out now suggest you show yourself winston or whatever you are
did you say man of curious habits jim talking to table
don think so doctor
there used to be only two examining tables in this room now there are three
just realised that
this is vial of orientine acid winston it will burn through almost anything but this crystal if you ve never seen it work ll demonstrate on you the table transforms into the alien
saw that but don believe it
vendorian doctor their planet is quarantined and few people ever do see them their ability to rearrange their molecular structure into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of deceit as way of life puts them off limits
mister spock get security team down here on the double
jim the vendorian attacks all three of them at once and escapes down the corridor
spock to bridge put me on ship audio repeat intruder alert the intruder is vendorian capable of assuming any shape or identity it changes into carter winston and looks for somewhere to hide phaser is pointed at it
anne what are you doing
my job it isn hard to guess who the intruder is you re the only stranger aboard carter but he knocks the phaser out of her hand and gets away just she picks it up again and kirk arrives
lieutenant nored you could ve stopped him why didn you fire
couldn knew he had to be the intruder captain but couldn harm the image of the man loved
lieutenant he is not the man you loved carter winston is dead
know that too now
security teams report no sign of the alien on this deck captain
was afraid of that once out of our sight he can become anyone or anything aboard this ship red alert sounds
bridge this is the captain what happened
two romulan battle cruisers captain and they re heading right for us captain log supplemental due to interference by the alien vendorian aboard the enterprise has been detected violating the romulan neutral zone by the terms of our treaty the romulans have legal right to seize and impound the enterprise to complicate matters we have not been able to apprehend the vendorian responsible for putting us in this position propensity for trespassing in the neutral zone captain kirk
it was not deliberate assure you clear to contravene them would mean war you will surrender your ship captain we will release you and your crew at the nearest outpost that guards the neutral zone
like few minutes to inform my crew
kirk to security what the status on the search for the vendorian seen him
carry on lieutenant the romulans were expecting us mister spock that wreck of winston ship was the bait to get romulan spy onboard and what better spy than vendorian who can shape at will when went down to my cabin he must have put me out long enough for him to return to the bridge and order the course change
it would seem so
open hailing frequency lieutenant ress
lioness with very long flowing mane hailing frequency open sir they re waiting for us over to us captain
wrong assumption the wrong admire your courage but
have no choice commander you lured me here in direct violation of the treaty vessel into the neutral zone
through the use of spy using the human form of carter winston creative but obviously out of control
you used vendorian which might add is also violation of the treaty surrender your ship or prepare to fight
will not surrender my ship scott finds man messing inside panel
what are you doing the man grabs his throat knocking him out then carries on
captain our deflector shields are coming down
bridge to engineering scotty what happened to the shields
mister scott isn here sir
up again now
hangar doors on the shuttlecraft deck are opening sir the vendorian must be trying to escape
we need him override the controls and shut those doors
doors closing sir
spock take the conn talk to the romulans try to stall them and send security team to the hangar deck ll be in engineering kirk; what happened
don know sir came up here to check the backup systems and there was crewman taking this panel apart that all remember
how long will it take to fix
two hours at least
get on it
you re not getting past me this time ve learned my lesson
yes he said you were like that practical as well as warm and lovely you re everything he said you were
carter what did he say
many things some were only feelings deep feelings he couldn always express he did love you
how did he die
winston crashed on our planet and he was tended by vendorian me he lived for almost year before his body ceased to function
you are so much like him his voice his mannerisms
that is the way of our people the longer we stay in another form the more we take on its memory emotion attitudes not totally but great deal as time passes
he did say he loved me
as do in sense feel some of the emotions he felt his love for you was very strong because was there it did not end when he died
carter
anne this is what am changes into vendorian shape can you love this changes back you see why told you it would be best to forget me kirk arrives
but unfortunately can the romulans fire at the ship and kirk and anne are knocked off their feet carter escapes kirk enters
direct hit captain damage to the secondary propulsion system the commander has apparently decided to fight
the romulan commander is signalling sir ll put it on the screen trained on you to resist would be useless and wasteful of lives do you surrender
without deflectors we re just clay pigeon for them
practicality does suggest capitulation captain
captain the deflector shields are coming up again
that only one shield
yes sir but it is between us and the romulans
mister sulu aim for the propulsion units of the lead romulan vessel prepare to fire phasers and photon torpedoes in combination
phasers and torpedoes ready sir
fire they disable the first ship
second vessel firing now sir
lock on second target
ready captain
fire
strange we did no damage but the romulan is retreating anyway
they may believe we do have their spy scan the other vessel for damage if you will mister spock
second vessel power supply out crew unharmed they should be able to repair the ship in few days
good work mister scott that deflector shield went up just in time
but sir haven finished repairing the shield told you it ll take hours and it will
interesting
then what was winston
it is not outside the realm of probability if he could rearrange his own atoms to become an examination table one would have to assume he could become deflector shield
will someone tell me what going on the vendorian enters
what manner of beastie is that
your deflector shield mister scott
assume the danger to your ship is over
it is
as it should be sorry if endangered your vessel
why did you do it
among my own people am non-producer useless an outcast fit only to do those tasks of the lowest order the romulans offered me life something of value could do it is important to be of value to someone
what changed your mind about the romulans
it seems captain that am more carter winston than knew he loved life he loved anne couldn allow the romulans to harm any of you because of him
understand
what will happen to me now
you ll have to stand trial but you did save the enterprise from the romulans and will recommend that be taken into consideration
thank you captain the vendorian changes into carter winston
in the meantime afraid ll have to keep you under guard think we ve had enough of that little trick
captain could you assign me that duty
but you ve seem me you know what am
form doesn seem terribly important to me as carter winston or even just part of him there better life for you than anything the romulans might offer can we talk about that
don know
you have the guard detail lieutenant mccoy enters as anne and carter leave
you caught him
acute observation doctor
glad to see him under guard jim if he turned into second spock it would ve been too much to take
perhaps but then two doctor mccoys just might bring the level of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels captain log stardate 3183 our present mission routine geological survey of type four asteroids is nearing completion the cruise has been uneventful and we are now approaching the final asteroid in our assigned sector full seventy two hours ahead of schedule as they approach the asteroid three romulan warships become visible and enterprise is attacked
scotty give us maximum shielding
mister sulu bring us about to new heading of nine oh two mark six
aye aye sir mister spock who the devil attacking us
romulans captain they were apparently lying in wait on the far side of that asteroid
cold-blooded ambush let give the heathens fight they won soon forget
negative we ve suffered damage and we re outnumbered three to one think this is an instance where discretion is the better part of valour
captain ve established contact with the romulan commander
demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack trespassed into romulan territory in defiance of your own treaty we had no choice but to defend ourselves
we came nowhere near romulan territory deny all charges and plan to file detailed complaint with the federation territory is punishable by death more weapons hits
captain the romulan ships are overtaking us at close range our deflectors will be unable to repel their attack
captain kirk an unidentified energy field is drifting into our path
strange it not on the charts
but it may be just what we need to shake the romulans batten down we re going through enterprise sails into foggy area with electrical discharges
mister spock what are our chances
the field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles if the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out
hold together little darling hold together enterprise emerges from the other side
it worked the romulans turned back rather than risk the energy field
reduce speed to sub warp cruise we ll lay by here for repairs
after that ride could use some repairs sumptuous feast with platters of fruit and dessert still on the table and drinking glasses that look like some vases ve got
how are the repairs progressing scotty
just fine captain we should be in tip-top shape in another twenty four hours no thanks to those romulan vultures
nevertheless we re still in business and propose toast to narrow escape
cheers
salud
to us
he this glass just leaked all over me
how do you like that so did mine
and mine
it appears we re all victims of rather bizarre coincidence the odds against something like this happening are astronomical
what coincidence we used to pull stunts like this in medical school with trick glasses don look now but we ve got practical joker in our midst
now let not jump to conclusions bones yes we all got wet so what the joke
twas probably minor slip-up of the food synthesisers ll check it out after lunch
fine right now why don we all eat up before our food gets cold but before the fork reaches his lips it bends and the food slides off
another coincidence jim
beginning to wonder bones am beginning to wonder captain log supplemental unusual incidents have continued to plague our crew even the perceptive mister spock has fallen victim to these simple-minded pranks spock has his eyes pressed against binocular device
curious very curious
what have you got there spock
captain found this device on my console it seems to serve no useful function and when he lifts his face from the eye pieces of course there are rings around his eyes and laughter from the crew
captain
sorry spock it your as these little surprises have grown more and more frequent our crew members have found them less and less amusing
officer scott won you join us for lunch
no thanks arex just going to grab sandwich and get me back to work
very good
one grilled cheese on rye what the blazes hold it just doggone minute all sorts of foods are being thrown from the dispenser and piling up around his feet
said one sandwich that all someone turn off this infernal food factory
excuse me for laughing but
go ahead and laugh big joke ll bet you two are responsible for this ay
hey wait minute we didn cause this to happen
tell that to the captain reporting both of you just as soon as then he gets custard pie in the face the situation has reached the point where friends are accusing friends the entire crew is on edge myself included
okay this whole thing has gone far enough
sir
ve just picked up my clean uniforms from the service chute and when put this one on discovered this in big bold letters on his back kirk is jerk the comm system bursts into laughter
when you all finish laughing appreciate an explanation
captain never laugh
well somebody certainly did
captain kirk look behind you
really ress you re going to have to be little more clever than that
this is no joke sir
now what vapour is coming from under the bridge doors kirk and spock exit the turbolift
it appears to be legitimate fog perhaps the humidification system is
here spock whoops
amazing this deck is covered with ice
and it was almost covered with us don know what going on here but it going to stop before someone hurt laughter from the comm system
there that laugh again something awfully familiar about it what do you make of all this spock
the evidence all points to one guilty party captain
you mean you know who behind these stunts
not who what believe our practical joker is the enterprise itself
of course that laugh it the voice of our main computer
precisely
spock want all hands at their stations we re going to run complete systems check from bow to stern and get to the bottom of this light by the door sign says unoccupied
good the rec room is unoccupied at least we can enjoy our off-hour without worrying about practical jokes
just what the doctor ordered they go inside and the doors close just as repeat all hands to your in the big empty room oblivious to the announcement
well what ll it be swim at the beach it holodeck they get beach with waves and seagulls
it is lovely but more in the mood for nice quiet walk in the woods
doctor that sounds perfect
then woods it is he works the panel and they get their grass and trees
ah now that more like it shall we
captain crewmembers mccoy sulu and uhura are still in the recreation room and do not answer the call to stations
that strange repeat the call
doctor mccoy lieutenant uhura and helmsman sulu report to the bridge immediately doctor mccoy lieutenant uhura and
it so peaceful so relaxing
and best of all no practical jokes laughter
what was that
not sure it almost sounded like someone chuckling
it was probably just one of the audio tapes rewinding come on there lots more to see out of their sight pit in the ground gets covered by fallen branches then leaves laughter as the three walk towards it
lieutenant uhura have to hand it to you this is just what the doctor would have ordered then they fall into the pit
there it is again someone is definitely laughing at us
going to get to the bottom of this right now
get to the bottom of this laughs
okay whoever you are so we fell for your juvenile joke now get us out
fell for my joke laughs
spock quiz the central computer about mccoy and the others
yes captain question why are we unable to communicate with crewmembers mccoy sulu and uhura
answer that is for me to know and for you to find out
did hear that right
affirmative the dysfunction is more severe than thought question are you deliberately holding our missing crewmembers prisoner
ll never tell
let me try this is captain james kirk speaking you are programmed to obey any direct order may give correct
correct
very well order you to release crewmembers mccoy sulu and uhura immediately
say please
well ll be
suggest compliance captain
pu-leese
say pretty please with sugar on instead he calls up scott on the main viewer
scotty
we ve got serious trouble with the main computer we have reason to believe it kidnapped three of our crew
to prevent any further trouble want you to shut down all logic functions until we can get handle on the problem uhura and sulu help mccoy climb from the pit
there
when get my hands on the clown who behind all this ll put him in sickbay for week
temper temper perhaps this will cool you off and now they are in the middle of blizzard and up to their knees in snow
we ve got whiteout condition here how will we ever find the exit
time for nap old girl captain orders then the gravity goes off
into communicator engineering to bridge emergency
into communicator scotty what the devil going on
beats me sir our gravity just reversed polarity all by itself
an obvious defensive manoeuvre by the computer
this is crazy our own computer declared war on us and haven the slightest idea why
have theory captain but first suggest that if officer scott moves away from the computer it might feel less threatened
scotty vacate the computer room
vacate sir but
on the double officer scott scott crawls along the ceiling into the corridor where he promptly falls to the floor
you bloody big scatterbrain make up your monumental mind
congratulations spock your strategy worked now would you tell me what happening to my ship
you recall that energy field we passed through
certainly
apparently subatomic particles from that field have invaded our computer circuits much like bacteria infect living matter as result the enterprise is suffering the electronic equivalent of nervous breakdown
what can we do to stop it
afraid don know captain its illogical behaviour precludes logical solution
the temperature must be twenty below and its still dropping
look this is still room no matter how it appears if we can travel long enough in one direction we re bound to reach wall then we can feel our way to an exit
then let move before we all turn into icicles
bridge here report the rec room all right but the door jammed
okay stand by
scotty we need work crew with power tools to open frozen door have them report to report to kirk starts giggling as everyone else starts laughing spock raises an eyebrow
come on spock where that vulcan sense of humour
hmm just as thought
spock what what are you mumbling about
our air is being pumped full of nitrous oxide better known as laughing gas but it no laughing matter especially for vulcans the three trapped people also have the giggles
this blizzard keeps getting worse
know if we don if we don keep moving we re going to freeze captain log supplemental somehow spock managed to switch on our emergency air before collapsing from the effects of the gas the fresh air quickly revived us although it ll be exhausted in another six hours
we must cure the computer by then or there no telling what we ll be forced to breathe next scotty how the door coming
some kind of energy drain set up by the ship we re giving it mighty go with the crowbars though depend on it
you two better go on without me my old legs have given out
but doctor we can and the computer takes pity on them they are in formal garden
well what do you know come on doctor we re finally getting out of here
hate to be pessimist but that may not be as easy as you think correction not garden maze but the doors are pried open
then again
you don know how good it is to have you back on the bridge alive and well
we re as happy about it as you are jim just like to make one request
sure bones what
could you turn up the heat
ll see what can
captain we re underway
engine room reports all engines shut down yet they re firing
captain the helm no longer responds we re coming about to new heading
as soon as our course stabilizes give me reading
course stabilizing at one one four mark twelve
we re heading back to the neutral zone
and you can bet those romulan ships will be gunning for us after while
sensors are picking up three ships captain magnification shows them to be romulan warships
we re decelerating sir
main cargo hatches are opening ll put them on the viewing screen
jim what in heaven name is going on
you know as much as do bones something floats out of the hatch then expands to become huge version of the enterprise
the romulan ships have halted their attack apparently the sight of spacecraft twenty times their size has given them second thoughts
okay admit it an effective bluff but so what as soon as they figure it out they ll destroy the balloon and us
wait minute there is method to this madness
please elaborate captain
the enterprise is pulling her biggest practical joke of all and this time the joke on the romulans the same romulan ships that damaged the enterprise
are you suggesting that the enterprise is seeking revenge
what else she going to make fools of the romulans by having them attack balloon and romulans fear disgrace more than death
commander there no radio response from the large ship
very well it has refused surrender advance at attack speed they shoot and it deflates amid computer laughter
we ve been tricked after them want that federation ship blasted into space dust
the romulans are giving chase
they must be furious to follow us this deep into federation territory
panic stricken don care about the romulans just want to avoid that energy field we passed through before helmsman do you have fix on it
yes captain our course will take us nowhere near it
good couldn face going through there again
the energy field frightens you
it petrifies me
how interesting
we re changing course to direct bearing on the energy field
no we can they do and so do the romulans
commander our instruments are useless in this field we ve lost contact with the federation ship
we ve got to clear this field before our ships break up bring us about on heading for home the computer is laughing then
my circuits you tricked me kirk how could you
what the devil is going on
bones the worst thing you can do to practical joker is to play practical joke on them
it not fair enterprise leaves the energy field
the controls are responding now
and getting normal function in all computer modes that last pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects
well done jim
captain picking up strange transmissions from the romulan warships listen desserts and they re still pouring out
shall we tell them how they can reverse the effects of the field jim
yes but later let not spoil their fun just yet captain log stardate 5371 huge cosmic cloud has been reported moving into the outer fringe of our galaxy nothing like it has ever been seen before starfleet command has sent the enterprise to investigate as we re the only vessel in the vicinity of the phenomenon our present position is in the pallas fourteen system which contains mantilles the most remote inhabited planet in the entire federation
we will intercept the cloud in the vicinity of alondra the outermost planet sir
captain we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud
readings
it seems to be of irregular shape some eight hundred thousand kilometres across and about half that in depth
it immense twice the diameters of saturn jupiter and neptune together
put up our present position lieutenant arex
yes captain
reading spock
this is very curious captain it computes as strange combination of matter and energy
captain look
captain alondra has disappeared from navigation scan
the cloud could have come between us and the planet
no lieutenant the cloud has engulfed alondra captain the planet seems to be breaking up its mass is definitely growing smaller
spock is it possible the cloud consumes planets
it seems logical assumption captain
sir the cloud is changing course
that impossible
the course change is verified sir the cloud is now moving directly toward the inhabited planet
but if it continues on that course
mantilles will die mister sulu increase speed to warp eight push it to the limit
yes sir captain log supplemental at warp eight we will intercept the cloud before it reaches the inhabited planet mantilles but we are uncertain what we can do to stop matter-energy cloud which measures thousands of times more than our vessel
jim if we can stop it millions of people will die
perhaps more doctor if planet annihilation is part of this thing nature it might seek them out as instinctively as an amoeba seeks out food it may not consume only planets but also stars we do not know yet whether it has any selective ability but it could be thread to every planet in our galaxy
bones need an expert psychological opinion do we dare tell the people on mantilles try to save few who could get away
how much time do they have
four hours ten minutes sir
it certain there be planetwide panic
blind panic
on the other hand notifying them may still save some small fraction of the population captain
who the governor of mantilles jim
bob wesley he left starfleet for the governorship he no hysteric
then tell him
coming up on the cloud sir eta five minutes ten seconds
thanks bones lieutenant uhura send priority one call to governor wesley on mantilles
aye aye sir
captain getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors
what kind
elements unknown in our periodic tables captain of the opinion this cloud has come from outside our galaxy
captain
evasive action
aye sir but the cloud wraps tendrils around the enterprise
reverse full power
full reverse sir
it still got us
the streamers are combination of koinoenergy almost an ambiplasma with an unusually powerful attraction force
prepare to fire all phasers into cloud mass
locked on phasers ready sir
fire
firing no effect captain
the cloud appeared to absorb the phaser energy captain the ship is shaken
we re floating inside the cloud
all decks report considerable shaking up but no damage sir
captain objects approaching on the bow
deflector shields on
shields up and operating sir
more objects approaching aft sir
analysis spock
the objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter
kirk here
captain the power drain on the shields is too heavy to hold for any length of time
scotty prepare the shields for an antimatter charge
antimatter charge ready sir
fire more blobs approach the ship
double the charge
ready sir
fire the blobs disappear
well spock any conclusions
only the beginning of theory captain it is possible this cloud in which we are entrapped is living thing the cloud is alive yes captain its components appear similar to those found in living organisms
bones any opinion
there some resemblance don know how much we can depend on it but ll tell you one thing we have to get out of this area those mists out there are acting something like macromorphase enzyme if the shields don stay up the hull will be corroded and we ll all be broken down into nice digestible particles
am inclined to agree with the doctor captain the mass of the planet alondra has been steadily growing smaller since we ve been in here
captain have subspace radio message coming in from governor wesley of mantilles
transfer it to my quarters
yes sir
mister sulu use your scanners to assemble diagram of the cloud composition and feed it to the library computer that not enough even if had the ships available to totally evacuate the planet
you have time to save some people bob to do
how are you going to choose
in three hours and twenty minutes the cloud will reach mantilles millions of people will die need your help gentlemen your analyses
if we assume the cloud is living being we must also assume it needs some kind of food to sustain itself
agreed judging from the disappearance of alondra the cloud lives on the energy it converts from the planets it consumes
exactly it is like huge bull grazing here and there in the pasture of the universe
what about those blobs bones
think they perform the same function as teeth they break up the larger chunks of matter for digestion
lieutenant let see what the scanners have come up with on the cloud composition vaguely familiar shaped object with bilateral symmetry and central dense core the subtly makes my brain hurt
it seems to have some sort of anatomy arex where are we on that chart
posting enterprise position sir
the opening where we were drawn in seems to have closed but there another opening up there on top
if this thing does have some kind of digestive system we don stand much of chance of making it that far
three hours five minutes until the cloud reaches mantilles sir
thank you mister arex since we appear to have only one way out we re going to take it mister sulu takes us to that central core area
aye aye sir
and if this thing does have stomach we just might be able to give it enough indigestion to make it turn away from mantilles later
we ve reached the entrance to the central core captain
what do we do now knock enterprise shakes
no need bones here we go the enterprise is sucked in to an area with bits protruding from walls and the blobs following get blown up
what are those things
think we re in what corresponds to the small intestine those things growing out of the wall would be similar to villi
villi
the human small intestine is lined with millions of them to absorb nutrients into the body another explosion
captain those villi are antimatter it the enterprise touches one of them
we ll explode mister sulu keep the deflectors up at all costs
yes sir
incredible they re destroyed on contact with the matter this thing takes in and then they regenerate immediately
yes scotty
is putting an enormous strain on the engines captain especially the antimatter what with the maximum power demands and all the reserve is falling fast
how much time do we have
but if the indicator goes below two anti-kilos the engines won regenerate
thank you mister scott mister arex try to make your way through to the opening on the other side
yes sir enterprise glides serenely along the jagged canyon
can hold it on course sir we re using all power
increase deflector shields to maximum
screens to maximum sir the ship slows and seems to drift in current captain log supplemental the enterprise has only fifteen minutes left before her power is drained and we are left helpless
if we don stop the power drain right now that ll be the end of us
and if we do stop we ll be drawn into one of the villi and the ship will explode
captain you said that villi are antimatter if we could get piece of it could put it in the antimatter engine and it would regenerate we have enough power for the engines and the shields to go on maximum again
we need both the matter and the antimatter engines regenerated
matter no problem we could beam aboard some of the planet chunks out there and we can cut piece of the antimatter villi with the tractor beams and transport it aboard like that
bring it aboard if the antimatter touches the inside of the ship or any of us we ll be blown to bits
can rig force field box that ll hold the villi suspended in the centre then can take it into the antimatter nacelle put it into the regenerating chamber and release the forcefield by remote control so piece of villi is cut and kyle transports it into scott box
scotty we ve got ten minutes left
the force field is holding let go things are spluttering due to lack of fuel
well that gives us two minutes all right gabler open it they push the box in close it the spluttering stops
scotty you ve just given the enterprise and mantilles chance to live
thank you sir
situation mister spock
the cloud is now only forty two minutes fourteen seconds from mantilles captain and we have ascertained an important fact this being does have brain
intelligent
impossible to say at this moment captain it has made only one action which might be interpreted as intelligent it changed course from alondra toward mantilles but that could have been an involuntary response to the sensing of food
where is the brain located
that irregularly shaped object at the top of the core emanates considerable electrical activity
it pretty certain to be the brain jim the functioning of the brain is basically electric
if we can reach it before the cloud gets to mantilles we might be able to save the planet we ll use the photon torpedoes to destroy the brain
captain this is living creature starfleet regulations
know the regulations against the killing of intelligent life forms mister spock but we don know this life form is intelligent and we do know the people on mantilles are doomed if we don stop it if have to be judge decide in favour of saving mantilles captain log stardate 5372 spock and uhura are using our sensors to prepare detailed chart so we may determine targets for our photon torpedoes
am doing the right thing bones once said man rose above primitiveness by vowing will not kill today
but you can let this thing destroy over eighty million lives either
captain have completed the analysis of the target area unfortunately the brain is so vast our entire offensive armament will not assure its destruction however the brain could be completely destroyed if we convert the entire ship to energy aimed at the brain cortex and expend the energy in one mortal strike
that sounds like you re telling us to blow up the ship
believe that is what just said doctor
your figures are specific and absolutely correct of course you re sure it will do the job
yes captain quite sure
kirk to engineering mechanism in the engineering core
computer control will be on the bridge when it time to trigger it
incoming message sir it governor wesley of mantilles
put it on the viewscreen lieutenant
yes sir go ahead governor
bob is the evacuation proceeding beginning but most agreed to let the children be taken off first but it only five thousand children out of eighty two million people
know
thirty one minutes and four seconds to mantilles sir
bob where katie
don worry bon she ll be all right goodbye
who katie
his daughter she eleven spock is there any way we could establish whether or not it is definitely intelligent perhaps vulcan mind touch
it would require physical contact which is impossible captain but may be able to reach out with my mind if we focus our sensors onto the cloud synaptic electrical impulses the input could be routed to the ship computer for analysis into thought
can link in the universal translator and put it on the audio system from here
can you do it in time
it is impossible to calculate captain there are too many unknown factors can only try to accomplish the link no more
twenty six minutes exactly to mantilles sir
all right spock get at it captain log stardate 5372 the cloud will reach mantilles in seven minutes spock has been working on the mechanics of reaching the cloud thoughts but doubt if there any time left and even if we do establish contact can we communicate with it and persuade it not to kill
the procedure is ready sir
thank you scotty alone here there is someone else listen to me me listen to me spaceship within you were food consume it consume sense it closely
how near is mantilles mister arex
the cloud will envelope it in three minutes twenty seconds sir consume that thing beings the same time you will come into mine spock stands up and looks around
bones he the cloud its thoughts are here don move lieutenant use the library computer put some views of the earth onto that screen
yes sir
this is the thing we come from lieutenant this is what want images of the ground from above cities children playing countryside and the clock ticks down to
awaiting your order captain
few seconds scotty we have to give spock that much spock sits down again as the clock goes to zero
jim if we don self-destruct now all those people will die
the cloud has stopped sir
quiet perceived be best if you return to your origin the way you came will you do this
lieutenant uhura contact governor wesley tell him to bring his ships back
yes captain
spock you did it the cloud is leaving
believe so captain there is grid at the top of the brain core it uses it to sense we can escape the cloud through it
mister sulu let get out of here through that grid
yes sir
spock what did you perceive
the wonders of the universe captain incredible completely incredible captain log stardate 52 we have just entered the delta triangle vast uninhabited sector of our galaxy in which high number of mysterious disappearances of starships have been recorded since ancient times the enterprise has been assigned the mission of surveying this area and if possible determining the cause of these disappearances there is continual fireworks display on the viewscreen the ship is at red alert
situation mister spock
our sensors are in state of chaos captain they became unreliable when we entered the triangle
magnification ten on forward scanners mister sulu
magnification ten sir
klingon battle cruiser deflector shields up mister sulu
deflectors up sir
lieutenant uhura open hailing frequency the klingon ship fires two shots which harmlessly hit the shields
ready phasers
phasers locked on target sir
fire
firing phasers hit the klingon ship vanishes
mister spock did you see what think just saw
yes captain
explanation
can offer none at this time however the klingon ship was not destroyed by our phaser fire its shields clearly deflected the phasers nor was its disappearance the type that would have been affected if it were using its cloaking device
any sensor analysis on that wavering effect just before the ship disappeared
the sensors are still not registering normally sir but would venture the theory it has something to do with the many ship disappearances in this area
natural phenomenon but what duty personnel on yellow alert visual scan three hundred and sixty degrees mister sulu
scanning three hundred and sixty degrees sir there are other ships surrounding them
mousetrapped if the first ship doesn succeed in blasting us out of existence they have two backup ships to do the job
tactically well planned when the federation investigates we ll be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance
captain we are receiving class two signal from the lead klingon vessel
one moment lieutenant mister sulu on my command want you to turn the enterprise and head for the exact co-ordinates where the klingon ship disappeared warp eight
yes sir
put the signal on the main viewing screen lieutenant and pipe the entire exchange back to starfleet command
it will take three weeks to reach the nearest starbase sir
nonetheless let have it on the record
aye sir signal in enterprise captain james kirk last known to be in command
your information is correct this is captain kirk fleet we have witnessed the destruction of our sister ship the klothos and hold you responsible surrender immediately or we will destroy you
we did not destroy the klothos and you are well aware of it commander vanished
you may believe what you like commander we were fired upon first and returned fire the klothos deflectors turned aside our phaser fire and then disappeared don know why but we are in the delta triangle
frankly commander what you accept is of little importance to me enterprise out now mister sulu
what fools thinking they can escape accelerate to maximum and prepare to open fire weapons fire hits the enterprise
sir aren we going to defend ourselves
your deflector shields are doing that for us mister scott
but to just turn and run sir
we ll fight if we have to sulu are we headed for the exact co-ordinates where the klothos disappeared
dead on sir we ll be there in ten seconds
captain our deflector shields have just gone out
sir the instruments they ve gone haywire can orient myself everything is
subspace radio channels are dead sir red alert sounds and the enterprise disappears
where did they go
captain ve lost all co-ordination dizzy
sir we seem to be suffering from some form of vertigo
sulu are we still on the same co-ordinates
can tell sir vision won focus he collapses then the enterprise reappears
captain on the viewscreen starship graveyard as far as they can see
it like vast sargasso sea graveyard of ships from every civilisation imaginable
where are we sir
at another place in time think if we check closely believe we ll find many of those ships are the ones designated as lost in the delta triangle
an alternate universe
something corresponding to that the records say every ship lost here vanished without trace most logged communication loss and disorientation just before disappearance my guess was they entered window to some other continuum comments spock
your logic is excellent captain there is random factor to the ship disappearances perhaps the touching of the two time continuums is erratic in any event the window stayed open long enough for us to follow the klothos in
aye and where is that tricky devil
ve been scanning for her but there are so many ships here it hard to pick up specific trace
stay on it mister sulu
aye sir
there are ships here ve only seen crude drawings of pictures in museums
sensor scans give rough approximation of the age of the metal in the hulls captain some of them have been here for centuries
captain there the old bonaventure she was the first ship to have warp drive installed she vanished without trace on her third voyage bonaventure looks very like fat enterprise with 0201ncc on the nacelle
the crew descendants may still be living captain
their descendants
yes am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster of ships ahead of us
scanners indicate the enterprise shields are totally depleted sir
good all hands to battle stations prepare to open fire on the enterprise immediately
captain the klothos dead ahead
sound red alert phasers lock on target
aye sir phasers locked on
fire
sir our weaponry is frozen
fire
firing phasers
report sir
no response sir there no indication of damage all instruments register normal then kirk disappears captain log supplemental first officer spock recording we appear to be in an alternate universe position undetermined captain kirk has been transported from the ship by an unknown power his present location also is undetermined kor appears in front of giant horseshoe-shaped table there are people of all different races sitting behind it including gorn tellarite klingon andorian orion phylosian he reaches for his weapon but is unable to take hold of it
vulcan or romulan that will not be needed here commander kor then kirk is beamed in
welcome to elysia devna interpreter of laws devna an orion woman gentlemen you now stand before the ruling council elysia is comprised of representatives of hundred and twenty three races our existence dates back over one thousand years during this time these diverse races many of whom were enemies on the outside have learned to live together because they must as result any act of violence is strictly forbidden and will be dealt with swiftly and with utmost severity questions
are we in an alternate universe
it is more aptly described as pocket in the garment of time
how did you freeze my weaponry
we have among us many individuals gifted with psionic powers peace being our single goal you were attempting to break that peace
pronounce the law
under our law you as ship captains are responsible for the behaviour of your crews should crew member with or without your knowledge engage in any form of violence whatsoever you will suffer the ultimate penalty total immobilisation of your ship for century
century we all be dead by the end of it
no commander kor this small universe of ours is curios trap time passes here but very slowly century means nothing to us our council appears young yet all are centuries old
your life here must be almost perfect if you haven wanted to leave
all of us have wanted to leave at some time captain kirk but we have made the best possible world here because we have found there is no escape from it
we are getting out
then we better do it pretty quick captain
if we find an answer it will still take time
that just what we haven got
what wrong scotty
it our dilithium crystals sir they re deteriorating rapidly
but how
don know sir maybe because of the time warp we went through but we ve only four days at the most before power goes
got any miracles in your computer spock
impossible to predict captain
don want prediction you will start work immediately around the clock nonstop until you arrive at formula that gets us out of here
these computations are useless get out of here and don come back until you have plan that works
yes sir
what do you see beyond your eyes magen
red-head with yellow cat eyes two new ships in each beings labour to solve the riddle the riddle of the time trap escape escape
gently good magen return to us now
it is impossible
they must try xerius they all must try before they accept
this is the best you could come up with mister spock
yes sir
have you covered every possibility every factor
several times captain do not wish to surrender hope but the facts remain unchangeable
he isn giving up if they can do it why can we
do not believe they can sir high rank probability their s2 graf unit which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive began giving off depleted energy readings kor decided to try to bluff it through
jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily
all power has been diverted to the engines sir we re picking up speed the klothos heads into vortex vanishes and gets thrown back into the graveyard where she started
you were right spock but almost wish they made it
their attempt has given me an idea as to how we may be able to break through the time barrier
mister spock has come up with formula which may just get us out of here
but this involves combining our ship with the klothos
that is correct
you mean you want us to co-operate with those
if we want to get out of here it our only choice
it complicated navigation problem trying to guide two such disparate ships
considering we only have two days left before our supply of dilithium crystals is exhausted say we go with this plan
agree sir
good ll contact kor right away
what is it
these new ones now they plan to combine the two ships and try again can you not stop them xerius
it is not against our laws to try to escape
but they may kill themselves in these mad attempts
so long as they do not break our laws we must not impede them
even if they die
it is their choice
then it settled our science teams will get to work right away conjoining our warp and navigation systems so we will function as single ship exchange of personnel and computer hookup to start as soon as we are beamed back to our ship
agreed
mister spock spock gets up and puts his hands on the two klingon shoulders
cannot tell you how impressed am by your splendid spirit of co-operation
mister spock
forgive me commander was overcome by the moment goodbye
goodbye mister spock captain kirk kirk and spock leave
the stories of his being half human must be true
perhaps the time continuum affected his mind
wonder if we all haven become affected
explain yourself
your willingness to work with your old enemy kirk it is not like you commander what do you really have in mind
you do know me kaz very well what would you think if the enterprise suddenly disintegrated after our dual ship had pierced the time continuum
would think my commander had manoeuvred brilliantly
and it can be arranged practically speaking
it implies rather high risk factor given the time involved and kirk highly suspicious nature but believe it can be arranged
very good kaz will leave it to you to attend to the details of the enterprise destruction captain log stardate 5267 we are in the final stages preparatory to making our escape from elysia
we must make our escape by tomorrow or our dilithium crystals will be too depleted and we will be trapped here forever
beg your pardon sir
what is it gabler
bell and are the relief guard for the dilithium vault we arrived few minutes late and found them poking around
we were lost
lost my foot it clearly posted as restricted area you knew you weren supposed to be there
gentlemen sure there has been mistake hands on shoulders where are you supposed to be working
engineering deck five
captain allow me to escort this young man to his work area
very well mister spock spock and the klingons leave
return to your post and don leave it until you ve been relieved
aye sir
jim worried about spock he just not acting normal
he under lot of pressure bones
know that but ve never known spock to act like pal under any circumstances least of all toward klingons
that true
and if he coming apart jim we re in serious trouble getting out of here hinges on his computations
ll talk to him bones it all can do
everything seems to be in order but then you re the only person who can really be sure isn that right spock
yes captain why do you ask
your recent behaviour is something wrong
believe there is captain but not within me sensed something strange about the klingons when we were aboard the klothos they were too agreeable too willing to co-operate
why is that unusual they want to get out of here as much as we do
had not touched them would have agreed with you captain but even though contact was necessarily limited and their minds were suspicious picked up some indication they are planning to sabotage the enterprise
sabotage how when
cannot say the klingon found near the dilithium vault knew nothing specific but there is some kind of sabotage in the offing
they need us to get through the time barrier if they re to get through at all security this is captain kirk want all security teams on duty around the clock watch every klingon who sets foot aboard this ship don want one of them to make move we don know about
you have the device kaz
by my calculations the capsule will be triggered the exact moment our dual ship reaches warp eight approximately three minutes after the time barrier is pierced and we have disengaged the enterprise will disintegrate
excellent kali you know what to do tonight they entertain us but the gift they will receive in return will be their destruction devna has danced for the guests
beautifully done
thank you captain you have seen the dance of orion women before
many times
wish
yes
wish could return through the time barrier and see orion again
you could go we re willing to take passengers
no you see we have all seen the futility of attempting to escape once each of us dreamed of breaking free then we came to understand it could not be done and we accepted our life here
we believe it can be done
then shall not interfere with your dream captain
get away from here human this is my woman
now just minute all did was ask her to dance she didn have to say yes
bones kaz draws weapon
stop the weapon doesn work
ship captains and these two will come to the council chamber now to face charges meanwhile kali places the little capsule by some computer equipment behind screen
you know any form of violence is forbidden here your man began the fight and attempted to kill propose we freeze the klothos and its crew for star century
may speak
you may
captain kor and were preparing to attempt an escape from here tomorrow if you hibernate the klothos you will not only be punishing them but us we cannot leave as single ship urge you to permit our dual ship to depart tomorrow as scheduled
getting back to your own time continuum is that important to you
yes
you will fail
we must try xerius elysia is in many respects perfect society but with all its virtues it is not home and home with all its faults is where we prefer to be
you would take these renegades with you
we need them
very well release captain kor into your custody good luck to you captain kirk you will be needing it the countdown starts at 10
ready to accelerate to warp six
ready sir
three two one accelerate
no the klingons have hidden an explosive aboard the enterprise she will be destroyed
enterprise this is xerius come in enterprise
warp seven captain
sir xerius is calling us he says it urgent
on audio lieutenant your computer room magen says it is located in the warp control panel
it will go off when you reach warp eight
spock scotty
approaching warp eight sir
the barrier
there it is sir spock grabs it runs to waste disposal chute and ejects the explosive enterprise and klothos emerge into normal space and separate there is big bang but the enterprise is still there
captain kirk picking up radio transmission captain kor intended for his home base he took full credit for our escape from elysia
why that scoundrel
it doesn matter bones
it doesn
that what matters the stars of home captain log stardate 5501 we are orbiting the planet lactra seven our mission is to discover the whereabouts or fate of six member science crew voice contact having yielded nothing landing party beamed aboard to see if the deserted ship log and computers could give us any information since our last contact with the three members of our crew on the planet surface as the senior officer aboard lieutenant commander markel have made the following decision the three remaining crew members myself included will beam down to effect rescue if for any reason we do not return be it known that
it was against all orders
the need was apparently desperate
the captain of ship no matter his rank must follow the book
capability afraid out of the reach of most humans
you vulcans are the most impossible unimaginative
bones that not helping the situation
sorry jim
mister spock what can we expect to find on lactra seven
it class planet gravity earth normal atmosphere earth normal there is no previous information available except that which the survey ship logged before her crew left her
according to their lot they beamed down six weeks ago
five weeks three days two hours and four minutes to be exact captain
careless of me mister spock planetary life forms
it certainly can support life forms but cannot speculate on what type without further data mister arex is conducting sensor scan now
it will take too long to do comprehensive scan want landing party to at least beam down to the last known co-ordinates the other crew used
jim if the others are lost why take the risk
because they may not be dead we have to find out
it still risk
that why we re here bones gentlemen we ll travel light phasers tricorders communicators and medical kit
you have the co-ordinates from the other ship scotty put us down in the same place
sir mister arex has located variety of life forms on the planet no large groups or city clusters yet
then we ll beam back up
logical captain
energise mister scott it looks like marsh land green with steam rising from pools of water
everyone all right
ten yards the other way and we be boiled alive
unusual that such lake would exist under these planetary conditions
er spock large red one-eyed monster has risen from the main body of water it has big teeth
most remarkable
it may be able to navigate on land
know it can big red rushes them
phasers on stun the three beams hit it it roars few times then dives back underwater
let get out of here on an elegant rock bridge formation
not very welcome sight is it
ll see if can pick up anything on my communicator this is captain kirk of the uss enterprise calling the crew of the ariel come in please come in
they re answering static did you get fix on that jim
yes that way
strange you didn get voice reply
there could be many reasons why we did not
never mind counting them they cross desert area and meet another creature with three toes and blue face which roars at them
phasers on stun
it seems to gather strength from our phasers in my opinion
concentrate on the underside of the neck they run away and it eventually falls over
captain
right here you all right
am undamaged where is doctor mccoy
it came from back there mccoy is trapped under the creature body
we ll get you out bones brute force is no use
it would appear more logical solution is in order captain we don lift the tail off we dig the doctor out they do
thanks the air was running out under there
were you hurt
no just surprised it isn every day dinosaur falls on you this is pretty strange place
agreed how much desert do we have to cross mister spock
one point one kilometres sir
we better pick up our pace there no place for cover if we meet any other creatures the bearing on the signal we heard is that way as they walk on
captain the beast did it seem familiar to you
ve seen something very like it on canopus three but that light years from here still this desert area is the same as on canopus
you propose the same environment necessarily prompts the same evolution
my shoes are full of sand
doctor your lack of scientific interest is amazing
ll be happy to discuss that with you mister spock next time you drop in to my medical lab at the waterside gazing at their reflections in the still water
oh this seems lot more friendly than the desert
captain doesn it strike you strange that two such different ecologies could co-exist so closely
ve seen stranger things mister spock
merely an observation captain
kirk to enterprise
any new information scotty point five kilometres north east of you apparently city or central gathering place nothing else yet
north east that where we got the signal from all right scotty keep scanning kirk out
don like it jim why only one short signal and no more
don know but at least they re alive
apparently alive we cannot be sure
choose to believe they are
allow me to test the water first doctor
go ahead but it looks clear enough
captain the water is too pure
it tastes just fine
nonetheless it is too pure
in other words it too good to be true
correct captain and rain forest this close to desert is also illogical it is my theory that what we have seen since we landed was manufactured not created
terraforming isn new it implies intelligent life forms
yes but terraforming usually follows pattern this seems like random choice
unless of course the random choice is the pattern
spock do you ever say anything straight out
thought just did doctor
gentlemen please we have work to do
the desperation of the science ship first landing party is now obvious
we re still alive aren we
that true
however not exactly safe flying creatures are approaching
phasers on full stun
they re useless
no they re like the dragons on maravel the stun charge should get them they fly off
that strange
by observation alone it appears they hit an invisible force field
if that true spock then the landing party are grabbed by the tentacles of three giant slug-like creatures
we ve been travelling for hours where are they taking us
towards the north-west toward the city scotty reported
captain there it is garish lump of candy pink red and purple surrounded by conifers
that must be five square kilometres
if these are the builders it is an admirable feat spock kirk and mccoy are deposited under curved purple roof onto blue tiled floor
they don seem very interested in communicating with us if they can communicate at all
perhaps not in way we understand keep receiving impressions
any ideas doctor
well ve got one and definitely don like it guess they re doing exactly what we would do
which is
well if we came upon an alien creature we never seen before the first thing we do is to make sure it was free of harmful bacteria then we see if it was intelligent
congratulations doctor most logical assumption
more important question gentlemen is whether or not there way out of here force field it seems harmless enough
so do the bars of jail unless you re on the inside
and we are definitely on the inside
hey somebody anybody
wasteful use of energy doctor believe they can hear you without your shouting
you said you were picking up impressions are the aliens telepathic
ve come to the conclusion they are captain but the speed at which the thoughts flow is too great for me to comprehend except for the most fleeting image
surely we can communicate with them some way
they appear to be as advanced beyond earth civilisation as you are from colony of ants
then what were all those other creatures where we beamed down
you will recall we recognised at least two species from vastly different planets the environment did not appear natural to this planet technology this advanced could easily travel to other star systems to collect specimens
you mean it some kind of zoo
exactly
they took our phasers communicators and other equipment so they must have some idea we re intelligent
not necessarily captain they could have taken them for the same reason you would take sharp object away from child
or maybe they want to see how our toys work
that too is possibility the slugs return and drag them out of the holding cell
now wait minute you you hey
we ve got to communicate with them as they are carried along past other creatures in cells
well so much for mythology
find them strangely attractive
look ahead they are deposited into their own zoo compound
better do what they want for now anyway they activated another force field
this is real grass
yes doctor this area has been carefully prepared for human types the aliens are safe now
how that
they are safe because we are now exhibits in zoo
zoo no animal
on this planet bones they seem to be the people and we are the animals
hello lieutenant commander tom markel this is our biologist randi bryce
james kirk captain of the enterprise first officer spock our physician doctor mccoy
we ve been expecting you
you ve what
we heard your communicator signal
then why didn you warn us
we couldn warn you they re constantly picking up our equipment and fooling with it
where do they keep the equipment could use my tricorder
no use sir they re on an exhibit table beyond the force field
there were six of you on the mission
we didn beam down in time to save the original three
lieutenant randolph is in the house she running high fever but we can seem to do anything about it
ll check her out maybe can help
what have you learned about the aliens
there not much sir this is zoo so tremendous as to be almost unbelievable
have you tried an escape
dozen different ways tunnels weakness in the force field nothing worked
have you tried to communicate
yes sir but all we ve been able to arouse in them is sort of quivering motion
we seem to have company two of the aliens are watching the new exhibits
they built this for us we ve concluded they re telepathic guess they read our minds and came as close as they could to make it like home
spock try and make contact
yes sir can seem to get through captain they appear too involved with each other the aliens quiver
you seem to be getting response
my impression is that they are laughing at me
so far mister spock we haven found anything funny in this
animals in zoo rarely do
let find the others feel need for human companionship it is sparsely furnished and open plan woman is lying on mattress on the floor
captain kirk mister spock this is nancy randolph our navigator
how is she
without my instruments it difficult to make an exact diagnosis rough guess is malarial type infection caused by an insect bite can do anything without my medikit
the lactrans outside what do they do
they appear to be guards sir making sure we don harm each other
do they feed us or do we shift for ourselves
they bring supplies once week
always to the same place
yes always near the display case
what display case
behind this house outside the force field all our toys phasers communicators medical supplies
then my equipment should be there
maybe we can get them to give them back to us
captain they are highly intelligent sure they are quite aware of the purpose of each piece of equipment now
the medical kit wouldn be harmful it would help her one of their specimens
then think about it that way doctor
food but it not feeding time
they must have sensed need and interpreted it as food
suggest we all concentrate on the medical kit it works an alien delicately picks up the tiny object in its tentacle and hands it to mccoy
it all here they haven damaged it
what your evaluation of the situation markel
they treat us quite well sir they seem to want us alive and well and they don want to let us go
natural reaction for the curators of zoo
sir do you think there is any chance of getting out
as long as we re alive there chance tonight ll try and find weak link in the force field
begging your pardon captain think we should face the situation realistically we are specimen animals in zoo and they have taken every precaution to prevent our escape to them we are caged for life we seem to be drawing quite crowd
gentlemen since they are learning from us why don we learn something from them
how we can get through to them
they communicate telepathically
between themselves yes but mister spock aren vulcans telepathic
to degree with our own species and with some others but the lactran intelligence is eons beyond mine
how much have you learned
about as much as mother learns from six month old infant
what their impression of us
we seem to frighten the smaller ones some the females believe find us quite ugly
what about the enterprise jim scotty could get worried he could beam down fighting force
my orders were not to attempt rescue under any condition
wise move captain from what can gather even the enterprise is no match for their force field
how about coming up with another move then
if may suggest sir
go ahead
it is obvious they can pick up specific thought transmissions from us if they care to go to the trouble suggest that one of our number appear to be ill the rest will put strong thoughts in our minds that communicator is needed for recovery
let try it and let be close to the communicator when we do ll pretend sick all of you concentrate
it little one could be child
once get my hands on communicator can have scotty beam us all aboard the enterprise ready now kirk falls to the ground
the communicator concentrate on the communicator it works baby lactran places the communicator next to kirk on the ground
enterprise this is captain kirk beam us aboard the communicator is snatched back again
what in the cosmos the baby fills the transporter bay
receiving an impression they are worried about their child captain
worried about the enterprise
they seem to think you made the child disappear they did not know we were deadly species capable of injuring one of them
well let not stand here let do something
the best thing we can do is argh
what is it
in pain they re in my head what happened to the baby what happened
captain fight it fight it as hard as you can they think too fast in too complex manner if he gives up for even one moment he may go mad baby carries scott out of the turbolift
everyone clear out
what going on
think it harmless but not sure
what do you want us to do
whatever it wants me to baby puts him down
now supposing you and talk this over you can talk can you you can talk well what can you do oh no listen you ll send us off into space if you
jim are you all right
yes think so
captain they have concluded they cannot break through your mind on one to one basis they are now gathering the mental strength of all five of them to break through
can hold out against that many
everybody concentrate on captain kirk form thought screen
no no let me alone please they re destroying me tearing my mind to to scott and baby beam back down mum and dad rush to them
all right scotty what are you doing here
my young friend brought me
you made contact
it made contact with me
what did you learn
it only six years old but it has an iq in the thousands it picked my brain all the knowledge in the enterprise computers and sent us flying off out of orbit
then how did you get here
convinced it wasn pet and that it should bring the ship back into orbit then got it into the transporter to return here
they re trying to contact us directly can make out something it it difficult they think so fast but the child has learned and told its parents all about the federation and the races it encompasses
that fast
what else do they know about us
we are considered simplistic but in the process of evolving into higher order
even vulcans
yes even vulcans
but the little one didn tell or think that to me
backward child but growing
exactly sir it seems they were where we are some tens of thousands of centuries ago their centuries not ours
do we get out of here
it appears so they do not feel we belong in their zoo crowd has gathered to watch them leave
everyone ready to transport
so long lad nice meeting you
kirk to enterprise prepare to beam aboard two parties all human
captain we are scientific contact team and we learned practically nothing
offhand say we learned to keep our hands off
but there was so much more
there will be other opportunities mister markel have just received their final telepathic message
which is
we ll be welcome back in twenty or thirty centuries
our time or theirs
theirs and it will take me some time to figure out how long that is
either way mister spock it will hardly be our problem captain log stardate 6770 the enterprise is on course for the planet babel where ambassadors from all federation planets are waiting to honour the enterprise distinguished passenger commodore robert april first captain of the uss enterprise and for the past twenty years federation ambassador at large now seventy five years old commodore april has reached mandatory retirement age
no matter where ve travelled in the galaxy jim this bridge is more like home than anywhere else
yes commodore know the feeling
to me she was always like my child was there in the san francisco navy yards when her unit components were built mccoy enters with mrs april
jim didn realise how many of the tools use in sickbay were designed by sarah
as the first medical officer aboard ship equipped with warp drive afraid had to come up with new ideas all the time
your modesty is unnecessary mrs april your achievements as pioneer doctor in space are well known
and it nice to know the lady is as intelligent as she is beautiful much like the flower she carries
oh doctor flattery will get you everywhere but afraid my flower is dying
it native of capella four isn it
yes but it has life span of only few hours this morning it was seedling within few hours it will be dead
excuse me captain you asked to be notified when we made visual contact with the beta niobe nova
thank you mister spock mrs april you re about to see another of the galaxy most beautiful sights the beta niobe supernova glowing ring doughnut is on the viewscreen
it is beautiful but also very deadly
we re travelling at safe distance from the nova mrs april
beta niobe you were present when the star first started its explosion jim
yes we were commodore
captain sensors are picking up an unidentified object travelling at an incredible speed presently on collision course with the enterprise
put the ship on red alert how fast is it travelling mister spock
at speed that should be impossible to achieve something on the order of warp thirty six
no natural object has ever been recorded as travelling at that speed
believe it is not natural object but ship
but who would have the technology to build ship that could travel at such speed
no known race captain nevertheless it will contact us in one point four minutes
hard about helmsman change course for twenty four mark seven
correction captain the ship was on collision course only by coincidence it is apparently heading for the heart of the beta niobe nova
that course of self-destruction lieutenant uhura open hailing frequencies want to talk to that ship captain
captain that ship is not responding
all right if they won talk we ll slow them down mister sulu put tractor beam on that ship
tractor beam on and operating captain
we re having small effect on other ship speed captain it has dropped to speed of warp thirty two
captain they are making visual contact
put it on the screen lieutenant blonde woman appears she speaks but the sounds are unintelligible then the picture fades
ve never heard that language before
nor
run that message through the universal translator lieutenant uhura perhaps it can tell us what language she is speaking in
captain the universal translator has the answer the woman is speaking the same universal language we speak but she is speaking in reverse
lieutenant let hear that tape backward which should sound forward to us
yes sir on the screen my progress release my ship at once or am doomed
open hailing frequencies again lieutenant tell her she is endangering her life if she remains on her present course
no use sir she refusing to answer
yes scotty what is it this speed
mister arex what is our speed
now at warp eleven captain
mister spock how long until the alien vessel makes contact with the beta niobe nova
three minutes forty two point seven seconds scotty
still increasing speed captain warp fourteen warp fifteen
have no choice have to release the tractor beam can destroy this ship and four hundred and thirty people to save one person mister sulu release our beam
sir can release the tractor beam
what do you mean mister sulu
our controls are inoperative the ship isn responding like it should
go to manual override
no responding sir
we ve got to release that beam or we re going to follow that ship into the nova
our speed is now warp twenty and the other ship will contact the nova in one minute fifty eight point three seconds
sorry commodore mrs april it looks as though we may not reach babel
as starship personnel we were always prepared to give our lives captain
we are still starship personnel captain
there still one chance after that ship enters the nova it should burn up and break contact with our tractor beam mister spock how long will we have to apply full braking power and execute course change
we are up to warp twenty two and increasing captain we shall have forty two point eight five seconds to correct our course after the alien ship enters the nova
you heard that mister sulu
aye aye sir
mister scott we re going to apply full braking power in minute
aye captain our engines are almost gone speed because the alien vessel is pulling us with our own tractor beam
the alien vessel will contact beta niobe in fifty two point three seconds captain
contact in thirty nine seconds thirty eight thirty seven
thirteen twelve eleven
get ready to execute course change mister sulu
yes sir the little ship enters the nova
now mister sulu
something wrong captain we re still being pulled by the alien ship
impossible it should have been destroyed instantly
apparently it was not captain our tractor beam is still connected to her
and we are still increasing speed contact with the nova in thirty five point one eight seconds
that other ship may have been able to survive the heat of nova but the enterprise can mister scott how about that full braking power
we re as badly off as before captain we have no control of the ship as long as that alien lassie has us in tow
contact in twenty seconds
keep trying those controls mister sulu
still no change captain
it got to work kirk fiddles with sulu switches
fourteen seconds thirteen twelve
never mind mister spock it no use sarah flower shrivels in her hand the enterprise enters the nova and gets surrounded by sparkles
we re still here lieutenant uhura can you get us visual the viewscreen is white with black dots
what
where are we the enterprise is sailing serenely through this reverse negative universe backwards captain log stardate 6770 the enterprise has passed into the most alien landscape have ever seen we are in some reverse universe where black stars shine in white void we are still in the tow of the alien ship both of us having survived the extreme heat of the beta niobe nova
yes scotty how are we doing down there
well we just had to learn to run the ship all over again every control is working in reverse
all right lieutenant uhura we re going to contact that ship again we need some answers
captain kirk the capellan flower
sure captain kirk has other problems besides your flower dear
you don understand before we entered this universe it was about to die and now it in full bloom again
how that possible
it as if it were growing younger again can almost feel it while holding it
captain the flower is not the only thing on board that is growing younger
explain spock
ship chronometers are also running backward the flow of time is reversed in this universe the longer we stay here the younger we will become sarah flower becomes seed
the alien ship is responding to our call captain
can understand her now without the aid of the universal translator
apparently our brains are also working in reverse captain so we can now understand her language that is why the ship seems to be operating in the reverse to us
captain james kirk of the uss enterprise we tried to prevent you from entering the beta niobe nova we assumed your ship would burn up kirk
who are you how did you come to be in our universe when amphion previously dead star went nova and came to life was pulled into the star but instead of burning up passed into universe where everything operates in reverse to my universe
our universe the same place in both universes created gateway which passed through
in her universe nova is dead star which comes to life and when the explosions of nova in her universe and one in our universe occur together it possible to travel between the two universes
then we must return the same way through the two novas longer nova it has begun it life as star suggest you set course to follow my ship perhaps our scientists can help solve your problem
we have little choice captain log supplemental we are proceeding to karla five planet arret
gentlemen sure none of us mind growing younger instead of older for change
it pleases me jim if we stay here long enough ll no longer be at the mandatory retirement age
nevertheless we must return home and am open to suggestions
it is logical that we must reproduce the conditions that brought us here two novas must occupy the same space in both universes in order to create gateway for us to travel through one star dying in our universe and one being born here would recreate the correct conditions
that would take remarkable coincidence mister spock asking if you are prepared to beam down to the planet
tell karla five that mister spock commodore april and myself will be beaming down
karla five has given us coordinates to beam down to her son laboratory captain
her son we don have time for children games right now scotty but beam us down
aye sir there is baby in playpen and man at computer console
may introduce my son karl four
the man of course my honour to meet you gentlemen
most logical if the flow of time is reversed then one is born at an old age and dies in infancy your descendants are born before you and your ancestors are born after you
then the young child in the playpen
my father captain
we could remain forever awed with the differences between our universes karla five but we must discover way to return to our positive matter universe
exactly the problem have been working on since karla informed me of your troubles captain kirk this is map of our galaxy our home solar system is here you entered our universe through the amphion nova here the opposite arm of the galaxy
we need to coordinate this to our own universe can we do that spock
yes captain apparently the two universes occupy the same space but in different dimensions
assuming beta niobe and amphion occupy the same space we can determine if there are any other novas occupying the same space in both universes
correct commodore now if you ll watch the star map you ll see the milky way here is beta niobe and here is earth it corresponds exactly with arret by superimposing both star maps we will see where two stars occupy the same place in both universes the red spheres indicate where two stars are in the same space no pair are novas in both universes
if stars begin as dead stars here then we could bring one of them to life prematurely
yes we could act as midwife giving birth to star then we would have two novas in the same position and theoretically return home
but had to pass through the novas at my ship top speed to avoid burning up your ship isn capable of such speed
that true captain
you are welcome to use my ship captain
have crew of four hundred and thirty karla five your ship is suitable for only few people
we can use her ship to transport us captain but we could use it as an unmanned ship with our tractor beam attached
it could work that how we arrived here in the first place
it should work yes but any miscalculation anywhere along the way and we ll be plunging tail first into supernova captain log stardate 6770 time continues to flow backward for us we have set course for dead star in this anti-matter universe that corresponds with the nova minara in ours we re being pulled by karla five unmanned vessel which is equipped with enough positive matter armament to ignite the dead star into life
we just might get you to babel after all commodore
ll be glad to get home but not necessarily to babel it only means the end of my career jim
message coming in from arret captain succeed or fail the outcome will remain unknown to me
yes karla five we ll burn to crisp or escape into our own universe either way you ll never hear from us again thank you for the sacrifice of your vessel
tractor beam working properly captain
we re meeting the speed of karla five unmanned vessel captain
how much time before the youngest crew member returns to the time of birth
eighteen minutes thirty seven seconds in real time but long before that we shall all be children and captain that also means we are losing our knowledge at an alarming rate it is possible we will soon be unable to operate the enterprise
how is our course mister sulu
don know what am doing here what is all this equipment
he too young captain
mister arex take over for him lieutenant uhura report to navigation console
sorry sir don understand all this equipment what do do with these controls
never mind spock can you fill in for sulu and uhura
yes captain but who will fill in for you
what do you mean
at what age did you become starship captain and when did you enter starfleet academy
see what you mean
as vulcan age the slowest will be capable of assuming command longer than anyone else but even will become too young to know what to do captain log supplemental we have eleven minutes of real time left to reach the dead star but all around my crew are turning into children unable to operate the ship kirk looks like he not old enough to shave april is middle-aged and uhura feet don reach the floor any more
ten minutes fourteen point twenty one seconds captain we shall arrive with only moments to spare we will need to disconnect the tractor beam at the appropriate time
tractor beam how do we do that spock
captain must assume command you are no longer able to command the enterprise
whatever you say what shall do
mister spock as long as am aboard am senior officer hate to pull rank but you will be capable of command only for few minutes not long enough to complete the manoeuvres necessary to take us home
you are correct of course commodore april command is yours
commodore captain april mister spock
now vibrant red head robert we re the only adults on the bridge they re all teenagers and children
make sure no harm comes to them sarah we have to ignite that dead star if we re going home mister spock you are still capable of following orders
yes captain
very good assume your post at the navigation console
the dead star is directly ahead captain twelve degrees south of galactic plane
arm karla five vessel spock
vessel armed captain nine seconds to impact eight seven the two ships rush towards the star
three two
hang on we re going right into the heart of the nova kaboom sparkles and enterprise flies out of an expanding gas cloud the right way around
we did it we re home again we re all right we re home the reverse aging process has stopped
but the enterprise crew they re all children
they can enter the transporter it retains memory of their original molecular structure
but what about us we don have to use the transporter we can remain young live our lives over again you could command starship once more
what blessing to be able to live one life over again if the life you ve led has left you unfulfilled no sarah don want to live it all over again couldn improve one bit on what we ve had together
oh robert they embrace and kiss later everyone is back to how they were at the start of the show
we ve received message from the federation that might bring you some cheer lieutenant uhura would you relay it to commodore april and his wife
in view of commodore april heroic actions aboard the uss enterprise this stardate we are reviewing his mandatory retirement and will consider his appeal to remain federation ambassador at large
well good just because someone is seventy five years old doesn mean they re ready to stop giving service to the galaxy
arriving at babel in one hour fifteen minutes captain
see your flower has blossomed again
yes our trip into the negative universe gave it second life it gave all of us second life captain log stardate 6063 the enterprise is tracing the origin of mysterious alien space probe it approached the federation home worlds made scan of earth system and then signalled outward into space before it could be intercepted the probe self-destructed we are following trail of disrupted matter left by the probe highly advanced propulsion system thus far the trail has not intercepted any inhabited star systems
status report mister spock
the trail is becoming fainter captain recommend we reduce speed to accommodate our sensors
reduce speed to warp factor two mister walking bear
aye sir warp factor two
captain sensors indicate vessel at extreme range
course projection mister arex
it coming in on the same course as the probe sir heading toward us warp three
no readings yet captain possibly second probe
hmm or it could be the sender lieutenant uhura all stations to yellow alert standard hailing on all frequencies identification mister spock
none as yet sir but sensors now indicate it is twice our size vessel appears extremely unorthodox in design and starfleet lists no other authorised vessels in this quadrant
reduce to warp one mister walking bear
warp one sir
lieutenant arex activate main screen extreme magnification fuzzy golden glow comes onscreen
any contact lieutenant uhura
no response sir
maintain hailing
approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it fascinating readings indicate the vessel is composed entirely of crystalline ceramic would almost say then the enterprise shakes
captain we re losing speed the helm doesn answer we re going sublight
bridge to engineering mister scott why are we losing speed thrust but it just like we re ramming into wall of clay don know if the ship can take the strain
all engines stop
all engines stopped sir
give me damage report as soon as possible scotty structural damage or overheating think we were lucky
bridge to sickbay casualty report
mccoy here no serious injuries what the devil going on
later bones
we have been encased in globular force field captain the source is the approaching vessel
but we hit at warp one we should have been smashed
it is force globe but one that is flexible enough to absorb any force cannot explain it clearly we cannot escape by simply fleeing sensors indicate we at now being probed
captain there it is the fuzzy glow has definite shape v-shaped nacelles behind cobra-hood style main body sinister yet lovely
other vessel is slowing an energy beam encases the enterprise
walking bear full power all shields reverse engines and get us away from that beam
evasive action will not be effective captain the force globe limits our manoeuvreing
lock main phasers on that ship and open fire but the phasers can pass through the force globe the beam stops
spock status on other ship
still approaching captain going sublight it continues to probe us its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting and the ship now looks like brightly coloured winged feathered serpent
have you ever seen anything like that spock
recognise it kukulkan
oh
mister walking bear how but one in your midst knows my name you will be given one chance to succeed where your ancestors failed fail me again and all of your kind shall perish
mister walking bear how do you know who aboard that ship
am comanche captain ve studied the histories of many ancient earth peoples especially my own that ship out there bears strong resemblance to god in mayan and aztec legends kukulkan
captain library computer confirms that ensign walking bear is correct the mayas had legend of winged serpent god who came from the skies bringing knowledge such legends were not uncommon among earth peoples captain
then we could be dealing with the basis of all those legends space traveller who visited earth in primitive times
entirely possible
but why would kukulkan want to destroy us
you don deserve it yeoman but you re getting few day bed rest then mccoy glows and vanishes scott vanishes from engineering
mister walking bear what do the legends say about walking bear vanishes
walking bear
captain security reports that mister scott and doctor mccoy have also disappeared
what he doing to my crew then kirk disappears
captain captain log stardate 6063 first officer spock in temporary command the enterprise is the captive of an alien life form calling itself kukulkan captain kirk and three other officers have vanished they most likely were transported by kukulkan to his ship it is vast empty blue space
we must be somewhere inside that other ship
and us without single phaser or communicator
at least ve got my medical kit for all the good it is
mister walking bear do the legends say what happened to kukulkan
no sir only that he left and promised one day to return
then that space probe that approached earth must have been his listen
we re being observed watched
is there any way spock could get through to us
don think so sir our sensors couldn penetrate this ship learn from them find their purpose if you can only then will appear before you the room turns into jungle then city with south american pyramid at its centre
ve never seen anything so beautiful
where did it come from
let find out
mister spock shouldn we be trying to find out what became of the captain and the others
lieutenant uhura you are supposed to be monitoring the alien vessel our first priority is to free the enterprise and ourselves return to your duties
they look like the obelisks built by the ancient egyptians
with one difference sir look at these carvings of winged serpent that not egyptian this gateway can pin down what culture it represents it looks chinese to me
but it still clue this city is one gigantic riddle keep alert
now that we re here what do we do
opinion mister walking bear
before he left kukulkan gave the mayas remarkably accurate calendar he told them to build city according to its cycles on the date the city was finished kukulkan was supposed to return the mayas built their city and waited kukulkan never appeared
kukulkan must have visited several ancient peoples on earth but each one used only parts of his knowledge to build their cultures
does that mean they all tried to build something like this
yes sir but they all failed
if no one on earth built this city exactly right then that why kukulkan never came back the entire city is our key
kukulkan said he would appear only when we learned its purpose
then there has to be some sort of signalling device here gazing up at serpent head on curved column
that odd ve never seen combination like this before
that pyramid seems to be the centre of everything going up there the rest of you spread out and circle it kirk heads up the steep stone steps
look sir another tower and there another tower down there there must be one at all four corners
what this table inlaid with winged serpent set at forty five degrees to the square of the tower making diamond pattern bear and scott climb the tower or column
looks like there seam here think the head can be turned come on lad give me hand they turn the serpent head
the sun that it scotty turn the head all the way around and aim it up here
aye sir the sun rays get reflected in focused beam up to the table
turn the other heads this way bones the serpent heads turn them to face the pyramid coming down
this is the last one sir with four near laser beams directed at the underside of the table waves of bright light are being given off
the whole things is an energy amplification system this is kukulkan signalling device behold me as am bright blue and red winged serpent appears in the air by the temple
behold kukulkan where are your weapons of destruction use them on me if you dare
we have no weapons and if we did we would use them only with reason
where is your hate you hate me do you not why do you not speak to me of your hate
but we don hate you kukulkan: you fired your weapons at me
we used them in self-defence you fired on us
am your master may do with you as will
do you think we belong to you
bones scotty quiet
it is as thought you have forgotten me and strayed from the path set for you
you say that we forgot you how can you expect us to regard you as deity if we don remember you
if you do not know me then it is my task to teach you
just once wish he let us use the stairs
what the devil is this place
it looks like some kind of zoo don recognise lot of these species jim
please feel free to examine any of my specimens
could never be proud of putting wee beasties in cages
but all of these lead peaceful life one that is safe and contented
contented cramped in these tiny cages
what you cannot see is that each of them mentally is in its own natural environment they eat breathe and live in worlds created by my machinery worlds only they can see they do not know they are in cages
then that city we were in wasn really there
even so would hardly call your city our natural environment
it was meant to be that city and all else taught to you ancestors but they became evil
but no one being not even you has the right to interfere with other cultures
have been alone all my life destruction fell on my race before your kind had discovered fire creatures like these have been my only companions have seen you on many worlds savage war-like filled with self-hate destroying yourselves in the end at last decided to help as an experiment visited your earth and tried to teach peaceful ways left intending to return when was summoned but you never sent for me finally sent probe and what did find warriors
but we work only to create peace
nothing you have done so far makes me believe that is true my creatures here have little intelligence they alone live peacefully in the worlds have to give even this creature one of the fiercest and most untamable ever created lives in peace in the world that create for him
good heavens this is capellan power-cat no one ever been able to keep one alive
why bones
they hate captivity you try to put more than one hand on them and they throw off charge of two thousand volts how did you ever capture it
it was an infant and easily controlled as you were when visited earth you still are children to me to be led and shown how to live
but if children are made totally dependent on their teachers they will never be anything but children
enough this is useless despite what have shown you you still cling to your disobedient ways my dream is ending and all of you are to blame
of course the elasticity of the force field can respond in only one direction at time all hands to battle stations full impulse power helmsman tractor beam on full power warp engines on standby mister arex prepare to compensate for warp catapult effect when we break free we will be thrown approximately five point six nine eight light years
compensation factors laid in sir but how are you going to break free
the force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time we shall both push and pull on it simultaneously it should become rigid enough for burst of warp power to shatter it
force field contact in three seconds sir
full warp power on my order now it works the globe goes bang and enterprise goes whoosh
reverse engines and come about lay in spiral evasive course for kukulkan ship kukulkan is swooping and diving on the men and they are dodging behind the display cases
something is wrong escaped but how will smash it this time he creates sort of viewscreen
jim the enterprise broke free
then we ve got to distract him and give spock some time bones what would happen if we pulled the cables on some of these cages
most of the animals would just lay there jim the capellan power-cat
come on bones
no stop but they succeed in pulling out the cable the cat wakes up generates charge and blows the glass case apart then it goes rampaging around smashing the other cases and freeing the animals
irrational savages see what you have done enterprise fires on kukulkan ship
kukulkan can you control one of your own creatures
cannot your ship has disabled my central power source
jim if that true we re all in trouble jim do something
quick your hypo full tranquilliser setting as the enormous cat advances on the cowering snake kirk manages to jab in the hypo before being thrown back by the electric charge then the cat settles down to groom itself
did you inject that beast or yourself
fine bones the cat last power jolt clipped me
it just like big kitten another animal is rubbing around scott legs
what this my aren you the friendly little darling
kukulkan think we ve earned the right to be heard
you continue to take advantage of me but agree speak
you think of us as being small creatures like this one are we really that inferior to you
no but the violence of your kind surpasses even that of the power-cat
we be fools if we didn know that but we also have been using our minds and trying to learn to live in peace
because we have minds we can be what you wanted us to be if we fail or succeed it has to be our own doing intelligent life is too precious thing to be led by the nose
but you are my children hoped could teach you help you
you did long ago when it was needed most our people were children then kukulkan we ve grown up now we don need you anymore
will let you go your own way have already done what can
interesting captain the creature was the mayan god from the ancient legends
and the toltec quetzalcoatl the chinese dragon and all the rest but not quite god just an old lonely being who wanted to help others
spock wouldn suppose that vulcan has legends like those
not legends doctor fact vulcan was visited by alien beings they left much wiser
the other ship is getting underway sir heading away from earth
it sad think what we could have done with his knowledge but the price was just too high
think know how he felt jim there line from shakespeare
yes bones remember it how sharper than serpent tooth it is to have thankless child
indeed captain
lay in course for starbase twenty one all ahead warp two captain log stardate 5499 we are orbiting the planet argo argo was once land planet but it surface is now almost completely covered by water the change was caused by violent seismic disturbances our mission is to study the effects which the quakes and other phenomena had on its surface this knowledge may save millions of lives on federation planet identical to argo which will soon be undergoing similar transformation special shuttlecraft modeled on catamaran has been launched from enterprise and landed on the ocean
this is the largest land mass on the planet isn it spock
yes captain the others are mere outcroppings they suggest the peaks of submerged mountains
suggest that we get these seawater and algae specimens they re the least of the lot
for once agree with you doctor the more informative specimens will come from the sea bottom
lieutenant clayton open the hatch and let our two scientists here get on with their business
aye sir
what that something with huge tentacles picks up the shuttlecraft and throws it away
phasers on stun mister spock
firing captain the creature retreats below the surface
what the devil was that thing
apparently life form which previous surveys have not recorded
let get closer look at it before the phaser stun wears off submerge lieutenant
aye sir they descend through the green water to the sea bed
dual respiratory system lungs and gills
its skeleton is similar to that of denebian whale captain the shuttlecraft gets slapped across the sea bed
it regaining consciousness surface mister clayton
aye sir the shuttlecraft is chased along the surface
spock prepare to fire phasers
phasers do not respond captain we must have sustained damage to the power pack when the creature struck us
kirk to enterprise emergency
we re under attack beam us aboard scotty but the sea monster bites the shuttlecraft then throws it against rocks mccoy falls into the water followed by clayton spock and kirk are unconscious in the craft
repeat we ve lost contact come in captain come in the monster grabs the shuttlecraft and takes it underwater ship log stardate 5504 lieutenant commander scott in command captain kirk and first officer spock have been missing for almost five days search parties can find no trace of them or the aqua-shuttle doctor mccoy and are continuing the search at greater distance from the attack point
there nothing there just nothing
see some rocks they re just above sea level about two miles away there something on them it the aqua-shuttle mangled and smashed nearby kirk and spock are lying face down in the water
maybe they re still alive they pull them out of the water
their bodies are functioning metabolism heart everything but the lungs
can breathe suffocating help can breathe he lifts webbed hand to his throat
what happened to them doctor what is it
something changed their whole lung structure they can live in the air anymore medical log stardate 5506 captain kirk and first office spock were rescued forty eight hours ago they have no recollection of what happened to them after they were attacked but medical examinations show and unidentified substance in the bloodstream has affected their entire metabolism and changed them into water-breathers their internal structure is completely transformed and even their eyes are covered with transparent film like the second eyelid of fish so far all efforts to return them to normal have failed kirk and spock are in water scott and mccoy the other side of the glass
we re stumped jim the hormone seems to be the major factor in your mutation but we just can identify it
are you sure the mutation wasn somehow accomplished naturally
it was infused into your bodies at key structural points it had to be done by injection
but can you duplicate it bones your medical computers have information on every procedure in the federation hospitals
it highly sophisticated and completely unknown to us
that implies there are intelligent life forms on argo
the sensors don indicate any life forms down there aside from fish
they did fail to indicate the large marine creature that attacked us perhaps the readings are incomplete blocked by underwater pressure forces oceans are less turbulent at greater depth such conditions would be more suitable to intelligent forms
well we can do much underwater exploration without the aqua-shuttle our equipment is too limited
we aren limited we can go wherever we want in that ocean
it too risky jim argo almost totally unexplored you be out of contact range unarmed
have to bones look at this place tank can command ship from inside an aquarium can live in here
know what you re saying jim but if you go down on that planet and you die there
right now we have only two choices live in an aquarium somewhere for the rest of our lives or stay on argo won accept either one of them
what about you spock what does your logic tell you
the captain states the case emotionally of course but correctly would be of little value to this ship if am confined to tank in sickbay must accompany the captain
an intelligence that can produce this kind of mutation can change us back we ve got to find it bones it must be there
we ll make contact as soon as possible mister scott
aye sir kirk and spock remove their aqua-lungs and dive into the ocean group of aquans are gathering food when they see the uniformed and booted humans swimming towards them aquans are green with gills and dark green fins across their heads the sides of their necks and chests
go away air breathers you re not wanted here
we won harm you we re friends
leave us it is enough our young saved your lives once if you go on nothing will save you again
wait listen
go away the aquans leave
don understand they said they saved us once
believe the phrase was our young saved your lives once
yes and they didn seem to approve the answer appears to be in that direction spock
would say so captain the instinctive reaction of all frightened creatures is to retreat to place of safety they descend into the rift in the seabed and follow tunnel to
fascinating and beautiful
an undersea civilisation capable of fantastic architecture medical triumphs unheard of in our galaxy why should they be afraid of us spock
it is quite possible captain that they find us grotesque and ugly and many people fear beings different from themselves
well speculation isn much help we have to get in there
perhaps there is way open on the far side there is much less activity there on the other side of the city
that building in the centre it seems to be important then they are caught in net these are the spies tribune air-breathers
you stand before the ruling tribunal of the aquans am domar the high tribune
captain kirk of the starship enterprise this is my first officer mister spock
you are air-breather enemies from the surface we have expected spies for long time
we came here in peace tribune
the ancient records warn that air-breathers never come in peace
they came without weapons
can we do nothing without consulting the ancient records
why do the junior tribunes wish always to change the records
let the mesh be removed but stand ready
the surgo-op was excellent they have mutated perfectly
your scientists induced these mutations
we do not wish to kill even air-breathers your memory was eradicated so you could not return here
it would seem their ancient records are as well preserved as ours they found us again to come among us as spies
you do not give them chance to defend themselves cadmar
rila is correct you may speak
we are visitors to your planet we come from another world
you do not live on the surface places
not on this world
enough clearly this is lie the air-breathers have come again to destroy us
you are mistaken sir our only purpose here is to find the means of reversing our mutations
that is impossible only aquan mutation is designated by the surgo-records
scott here what is it doctor
sensors just gave us an update reading scotty there seaquake due in that area bad one complete topography changes
how soon
within four hours when are jim and spock due to make contact
can you contact them sooner
their directional marker indicates they descended toward that fern bed as the hull of the boat passes overhead
air-breathers we must inform the tribunes
the name of our starship is on the aqua-shuttle if you want proof examine the wreckage
yes let us examine the wreckage before we make judgement
we have news high tribune
speak it
three air-breathers have invaded the sea foliage we saw them as we gathered edibles
do you still believe these creatures came in peace
we do not know what to believe
take these spies to the surface boulders and leave them there it is justice enough for our enemies spock and kirk are pinned under net near the aqua-shuttle remains
conserve your strength will free you the mesh is too strong
go to the big island bring assistance party scott has been diving
did you see anything
not sign of them wait minute who are
follow me your friends need help
there
quick lads spock and kirk are freed and back in the water
stand by in the scouter-gig lieutenant scott is protected by personal force field
rila this is my engineering officer mister scott tribune rila is an aquan their city is short distance away
we re obliged for your help captain we ve been trying to contact you for two hours there sea bottom quake due it ll destroy this whole area
there are legends of such happening it destroyed the ancient knowledge and caused the great surface places to sink into the sea
that suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies
we did not evolve mister spock when the surface places began to sink many air-breathers were mutated through surgo-op just as you were as the centuries passed the mutations became hereditary
strange that such highly developed race would be violent
apparently they were exposed to frightening geological disaster such hardship induces savagery and violence
they hunted and killed us we feared they would contaminate us with their violence that is also why it is forbidden to mutate back to surface forms
then reverse mutation is possible
there are legends of sealed places in the sunken ruins where many knowledge records of it are kept the seabed shakes
there not much time captain the quake due in less than two hours
how far are the ruins rila
only short distance
those old records may hold the key to reversing our mutations we ve got to find them before it too late
cannot take you to the ruins it is against ordainments
it important rila not just for us the population of another planet is threatened by surface changes too argo ancient knowledge can help save them
yes will take you as far as the reef barrier
the ruins lie that way now take care the tides are strong she leaves kirk and spock are pulled along by the current
fascinating obviously an entire portion of the continental shelf sank within few minutes this may be the sealed place rila mentioned believe this is an entrance panel captain they swim down staircase
there another chamber room in the roman style with canisters and equipment including caduceus
this resembles ancient medical symbols captain the torso indicates mutation
that it spock the key to the survival of the race they grab couple of canisters each and swim for it but they encounter mister tentacles the sea monster fortunately another quake hits and it gets buried under collapsed building mccoy has got the scrolls out of the canisters
if the universal translator is right the substance in your bloodstream is similar to the ambergris of earth whales reverse mutation is induced by infusion of an antitoxin concentrated doses of it
what the composition of the antitoxin bones
it made from the venom of the argo sur-snake
to capture sur-snake we need your help our people can descend to that depth
domar has warned that if we break more ordainments we will be exiled to the open seas
we cannot reverse our mutations without the serum nor can the aquans benefit from the knowledge of their ancestors
but the ordainments state clearly that capturing sur-snakes is forbidden
ordainments are useless in times of turbulence only knowledge will help us
nephro we must break the ordainments they net the monster that was caught by the falling ruins
quickly captain they milk it venom while another quake strikes
quickly we must leave
we need more venom
no no there is no time this time the monster is totally squashed by falling masonry mccoy and chapel are in the water too
we have prepared an antitoxin from the venom of the sur-snake but part of the old records is missing so the exact dosage is unknown experiments on fish show that if the antitoxin is too strong it causes over-mutation which cannot be reversed by any means we re running out of venom so conclusive experiments are impossible decreased the strength by three quarters jim but we can be sure it right
how many infusions bones
two small one large
well let get started mccoy injects kirk who turns red then white
his pulse is fading turns pink again pulse and heart normal something happening to his metabolism it at least ten times normal speed the webbing between his fingers disappears metabolism normal heartbeat normal the lungs are beginning to revert this is the last dose the largest infusion he grows scales the antitoxin was too strong the scales vanish he starting to breathe quick get him out of the tank outside
how do you feel jim
little dizzy otherwise normal
well better get into some dry clothes wouldn want you to catch cold your turn spock domar and rila are wearing aqualungs
we ll bombard the unpopulated pressure areas with phaser beams and change the epicentre of the quake so it won endanger your people or your city
did not believe such knowledge was possible
major tremors will start in three minutes captain
it is incredible all of it
confirm co-ordinates mister spock
confirmed sir
fire phasers as directed gentlemen
aye aye sir
sensors indicate the epicentre of the quake was in the north polar seas captain totally uninhabited area
then our people are safe
when can we beam down spock
the seabed should stabilize within few hours
argo appears to have new city captain or rather one reborn
our people survived the seaquakes with little damage thanks to your help
we owe you and your friends much gratitude captain kirk we will try to repay by making the ancient records available for your studies
our experience here has shown us the means of diverting quakes that will mean much to the endangered federation planet
the light is warm and the air is soft shall be glad when the surface places can be inhabited
the young aquans have decided to rebuild the great shelters of the air-breathers
only the young aquans
senior aquans cannot adjust to the thought of becoming air-breathers we will remain at the aqua city
don lose contact with each other like your ancestors
we will pass ordainments to forbid it
and we this time will not ignore them first officer log stardate 4187 the enterprise shuttlecraft copernicus is en route to starbase two five with an important cargo slaver stasis box discovered by archaeologists on the planet kzin
these stasis boxes are the most remarkable thing the slavers ever produced time stands still inside stasis box billion years means nothing in there what is it lieutenant
ve studied the history of the slaver empire but it sketchy we know they were masters of all the intelligent beings in this galaxy billion years ago until one race revolted are the stasis boxes the only source of information we have
the slavers and all their subjects were exterminated in the war that followed intelligent life had to evolve all over again the stasis boxes are the only remnant of those lost civilisations
why is it glowing like that
mister sulu what is our position
passing beta lyrae sir one forty two degrees north east of galactic plane
most peculiar this indicates there is another stasis box circling beta lyrae
another one
it would be most illogical that stasis box would remain here undiscovered for so long beta lyrae is one of the rare spectacles of the galaxy almost every ship that passes stops to see it
maybe no one else was carrying stasis box detector
possible the only known stasis box detector is another stasis box still mister sulu
yes sir
bring us about we ll investigate the beta lyrae system
aye aye sir the only remnant of species which ruled most of this galaxy billion years ago their effect on science has been incalculable in one was found flying belt which was the key to the artificial gravity field used by starships another box contained disrupter bomb with the pin pulled as result all stasis boxes are now under the jurisdiction of starfleet and only certain key specialists handle them the boxes are rare potentially dangerous and we seem to have found second one spock sulu and uhura are wearing life-support belts spock carries the box
never did like these little ice-bound worlds
we are not tourists here lieutenant
mister spock if it takes stasis box to find another stasis box how did anyone ever find the first one
as with number of discoveries purely by accident lieutenant the other box seems to be almost under us perhaps thirty metres below the ice
we won have any trouble digging for it in this low pressure the ice should boil as soon as the phasers melt it but they are not alone sulu gets shot then uhura then spock this event instead of being warned by the highly unlikely coincidence of second stasis box allowed it possible value to influence my judgement the kzinti now possess our stasis box its contents will determine how much damage my error has done the federation and its people
where are we
kzinti spacecraft
that isn good kzinti aren supposed to have phasers are they
the treaty of sirius does not permit them any weapons at all beyond police vessels obviously the treaty has been broken
police web we won be able to move unless we can turn it off somehow group of cats in spacesuits enter
the lean be-draggles one is reader of minds
ve heard all kzinti telepaths are unhappy neurotics he fits the description
there is no sure way to guard our thoughts from him mister sulu he is not likely to deal with me or lieutenant uhura she and are inferior beings to them but the kzinti are meat eaters if you sense him reading your mind think of eating raw vegetable
yes sir maybe can goad them into revealing their purpose
lieutenant uhura this may be crucial in the presence of the kzinti do not say anything do not do anything startling try to look harmless
any special reason
are you forgetting kzinti females are dumb animals in an emergency the kzinti may forget human female is an intelligent creature
thanks thanks lot
lieutenant value your intelligence but we may be able to seize an opportunity to escape if the kzinti believe you have none
yes sir
identify yourself
lieutenant sulu of the starfleet vessel enterprise this is first officer spock
you re vulcan feel no pressing need to talk to an eater of roots and leaves humans at least are omnivorous am chuft-captain you are prisoners aboard the privateer traitor claw stolen police vessel
stealing must be habit with you this ship two stasis boxes
kzinti archaeologists found both boxes but the one we managed to keep was empty it served us well as bait to draw you here but the slavers had weapons that could devastate galaxy there could be one in that box
the kzinti fought four wars with humankind and lost all of them the last one was two hundred years ago and you haven learned thing since
guard your speech none of my crew has yet tasted human meat as our ancestors did we would welcome the opportunity always you have had superior equipment we seek weapon that will defeat you at last
then you re really working for the kzinti government
the records will show the traitor claw is stolen police ship if we are captured the highest of kzin will repudiate us but if we succeed you are meat for our tables they fire beam at the stasis box then open it chuft removes picture of one-eyed green crocodile standing on it hind legs
could that be picture of slaver
if so it is the first ever discovered an important historical find there are other things in the box
it looks like fresh meat over billion years in that box and it looks fresh then green pistol-shaped thing
nothing like this has ever been found we are the only ones who have it look at it human this weapon may well mean the end of mankind first officer log supplemental the kzinti now possess weapon potentially deadly to the entire galaxy the extent of its power remains to be seen
have the humans moved to the surface and be sure they re secured in the police web we will use them to test the weapon
yes chuft-captain
you have observed the aliens can you read their minds
can read sulu with difficulty chuft-captain the other human is only female the third is pacifistic herbivore surely you would not force me to delve such minds
if it is necessary realise the time you need to recover from each effort the meat that was in the stasis box it is protoplasmic and poisonous
what of the picture
the human sulu believes it to be slaver
so do it would have made worthy enemy he tries the weapon but nothing happens
perhaps the toggle the weapon glows then changes to more pointed shape chuft-captain tries it again still nothing
telepath am not affecting him at all is it the life support belt interfering
no chuft-captain he hears faint whine but he feels no ill effects there is vibration in the metal of his belt chuft-captain he is too alien he makes me taste yellow root munched between flat teeth
be glad if you need not read the vulcan mind it may be communications device or sonic stunner designed to affect members of race now dead he changes its shape again
good serviceable telescope they built well these slavers
it is of no use to us we already have small telescopes another shape change and this time it does fire beam
give you credit human you are not afraid to die
merely laser the federation has had more effective model for over one hundred years another shape change and the device becomes hand-held rocket pulling chuft-captain along with it he knocks uhura off the web and she tiptoes away meanwhile chuft hits the telepath
telepath suit has ruptured
never mind that the female is escaping
what of it
fool human females are intelligent so uhura gets shot and put back on the web
telepath suit lost considerable pressure we reached the ship in time to save him
good we will need him later what is this
perhaps personal rocket motor one could place one foot on the pedals and balance it appears to be transportation not weapon
nice try
slowing down used to run the hundred in record time how long was out did miss much
not much lot of good they ll get out of that rocket setting
we are fortunate none of the settings so far have been superior to the technology now available to the federation
uh oh now the weapon is ball with loops sticking out on either side
no gun sight no obvious was to aim it so he holds it at arms length behind him the lights go out in the cavern where their ship is parked
mister spock can move
so can the police web is off
the fifth setting seems to be an energy absorber fascinating had no idea the slavers had such things
mister spock we
yes when give the word make for the shuttle remember to zigzag ready go sulu and uhura run while spock jumps the kzinti and grabs the weapon before following uhura gets shot again
chuft-captain what happened
would rather not discuss it help me into the ship
hiding mister spock thought it was one of the aliens
have the weapon
they ve got uhura and subspace radio they can call for help from the kzin planet if they think the weapon worth it
no they cannot or rather will not
why
because kicked chuft-captain consider chuft-captain has been attacked by an herbivorous pacifist an eater of leaves and roots one who traditionally does not fight and the ultimate insult left him alive chuft-captain honour is at stake he must seek personal revenge before he can call for help
that gives us some time you did plan it that way
of course
as long as you stay free the kzinti can or won do anything but they could use lieutenant uhura as bribe
agreed however to this point we have not seen anything more powerful than equipment starfleet already has
yes but have feeling mister spock this weapon must have belonged to spy an espionage agent
acknowledge your expertise in the field of weapons mister sulu but do not see how you can determine probable ownership
well here look at it all these settings we don know common slaver soldier couldn handle them but as weapon only the laser is effective the others aren necessary for the line soldier one purpose to destroy the enemy
assuming it spy weapon then the slavers would have wanted to keep it secret weapon if so it is logical to assume it has self-destruct setting too
but we ve seen all the phases
perhaps not there is the null setting it seems to do nothing but why should it be there it does not correspond to safety lock he pushes the toggle back up to the top and it turns into globe with handle
it may be the key to another setting the kzinti ship takes off through the ice
this is the traitor claw calling mister sulu will you bargain or must we take harsh action it will not be pleasant for her repeat we have the female prisoner as hostage you have something we want we will trade her life for the slaver weapon
answer him lieutenant
lieutenant sulu here what about mister spock
not interested
am as the vulcan left me with two ribs broken have not set them nor bandaged myself he may conceivably kill me
kzinti ribs have some vertical bracing but kicked him over one heart compute the odds of my defeating chuft-captain in combat at sixteen to one against
offer refused
they think very little of you
wrong they don think much of you sulu turns the globe and it becomes more weapon-like
self-destruct mechanism would not have gun sight
no let see what this does do he points it at the horizon and there is massive explosion
we can give them that
fascinating no world in the federation has produced anything so powerful almost beyond theoretical limits total conversion of matter to energy at distance
if the kzinti had that the whole galaxy would be their dinner table the eruption caused by his firing of the weapon is continuing
hit the dirt the wind from the blast hits them knocking them over sulu drops the weapon and it turns back into globe spock sulu and uhura are on the police web while chuft-captain plays with the globe it forms another new shape
what would this be
have no idea it is generating power
there is grid it may be another communications device but that seems redundant the device starts beeping
it has the kzinti frightened
the kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners
could it be voice-activated mechanism
no it appears to be conversing with them reasoning computer that small
how long has it been since you were turned off
do not know when am off have no sense of passing time
what is the last thing you remember
we were on mission may not tell you of it unless you know certain code words
if you could describe the positions of the stars in your sector we would know how much time has passed since then
without certain code words may not describe our location
one of the settings on this weapon was total conversion beam we saw it tell us how to find it
twist me widdershins until you reach the null position then
they ve got it
there must be something we can do
most peculiar the weapon is different shape entirely with two large prongs the kzinti leave with it
that was not the total conversion beam setting
like others this form seems to possess no gun sight
it may be broad-beam weapon for use only from orbit we saw its power suggest you fire at very distant target
very well
we can let them have that weapon
they are not about to get it lieutenant
why not
assume you are slaver war computer you ve been turned off you do not know for how long but when you were turned off there was war on now you are awakened by aliens you never saw before they do not know any of the military passwords they ask you so many questions it is obvious they know little about you your owner is nowhere about what would you think
think been captured by the enemy or an enemy at least
and when they asked you how to find your most powerful weapon setting what would you give them outside chuft-captain pulls the trigger kaboom there is crater where he was standing and part of the ship hull has been blown away
activate life support belts
disrupter field
yes another conventional weapon it appears the total conversion beam was the only thing the slavers had that we do not
no sign of the weapon of course it would have looked nice in some museum
it never would have reached the museum lieutenant there was too much power in that one setting if not the kzinti the klingons or some other species would have tried to possess it
strange how the past sometimes breaks through into the present that ancient war could have sparked new war between man and kzinti
didn you say the kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their dead owners
yes an ancient superstition
at this rate they ll never get over those old superstitions captain log stardate 6334 the outbreak of choriocytosis aboard the enterprise seems to be under control doctor mccoy says the disease is no longer even as serious as pneumonia and there should be no problem completing our present mission representing the federation at the dedication ceremonies for the new academy of science on deneb five
status mister spock
all systems affirmative captain the enterprise is on course and on schedule
it ll be nice to play diplomat for change eh spock spock grimaces in pain and falls to the floor unconscious
kirk to sickbay emergency
jim choriocytosis is strange disease in races with iron-based blood it practically nothing but in others
get to the point bones
spock has contracted the disease it fatal to vulcans
are you sure
ve triple-checked jim wish to god was wrong spock blood is copper-based the infection enters the blood stream and encases the cells so they can carry oxygen
the result is suffocation
yes jim
is there any cure
one naturally occurring drug called strobolin but it only found on few planets in the galaxy
library computer
working
what is the nearest strobolin supply planet to our present position
beta canopus four solar days away at maximum warp
how long can spock last without the drug
can give him injections of synthesised drug that would slow the disease but after two days the body builds up an immunity it loses its effectiveness by the end of the third day the disease will be irreversible
it ll take four days to get the drug but spock will die in three there got to be way
what about rendezvous
of course if we cant go out of our way to get the drug in time there must be another ship closer to beta canopus kirk to bridge get me starfleet lieutenant captain log supplemental we ve arranged to get the strobolin needed to save mister spock life the starship potemkin has already picked up the drug and will transfer it to freighter the ss huron for delivery to the enterprise
what will the symptoms be bones
increasing tiredness steadily decreasing efficiency all the symptoms of working in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere kind of like the test you had to pass back at the academy knock at the door
come
you wished to see me sir
yes spock sit down we ve arranged rendezvous to pick up the drug you need
trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at deneb five
no it won
will that be all captain
one other thing ve cut your duty time in half
captain that won be necessary quite able
no arguments spock doctor orders
anything else sir
that all spock dismissed spock leaves
it ll hurt seeing him like that
know as much as it might seem at times that can stand that pointy-eared encyclopaedia don want to see that happen to him the crew are in starfleet uniforms
its woman eta at rendezvous point two hours and seven minutes captain
good that pretty important drug we ve got for the enterprise just as soon get rid of it and get back to shipping just dilithium
sir our sensors are picking up ship ahead
could the enterprise be that early
not sure it the enterprise sir it too far away to tell
where it headed
toward us sir
keep an eye on it lieutenant
time to rendezvous mister arex
one hour forty three minutes sir
hate to ask but
aye captain we ll squeeze wee bit more speed out of her
what is it bones
mister spock spock
was conserving energy captain
mccoy wants you in sickbay
sensor readout captain it not the enterprise closing on us sir
another starship
no sir it an alien ship design ve never seen before
put it on the screen wicked-looking bat-like design in red appears
you re sure it following us
it on an intercept course now captain and at this speed they ll get us before we get to the enterprise
this won hurt bit spock
an unnecessary assurance doctor in addition to being untrue
that the last time waste my bedside manner on vulcan
such restraint would be welcome
not so fast spock lie there quietly the monitor buzzes then goes quiet
well that not too bad back to work mister spock
thank you doctor spock leaves
the drug isn working any more
know christine know don worry we ll have the strobolin soon
they ve increased speed sir closing fast
open hailing frequencies again
open sir
to unidentified alien vessel this is captain shea of the ss huron please state your registry and purpose repeat please identify yourself and your purpose
it no use sir they re receiving but they re not answering
well we ve got hold full of dilithium and that drug to protect evasive manoeuvres but the alien stays with them
no good captain send out an emergency signal to the enterprise
yes sir message from the alien sir
let hear it
captain getting signal from the huron it an emergency beacon automated
try ship to ship
did sir no response
sensor report mister spock are they at the rendezvous point
no sir they hadn reached it
compute new course mister arex let see what going on they arrive at the huron
the huron power levels are at bare minimum for life support captain picking up metallic debris
was the huron attacked
based on present data would say yes
spock are you all right
captain collapses
bridge to sickbay emergency
we ve got to have that drug jim the synthetic is useless now
do what you can bones
blasted vulcan why couldn you have red blood like any normal human
status
at spock station the huron engines are dead emergency battery power is operating life support systems at low but acceptable level
still unable to make contact sir
is anyone on that ship alive
yes sir
mister scott lieutenant uhura come with me mister sulu you have the conn we re beaming over the officers are slumped over their consoles
scotty check the cargo hold see if the drug is there
aye sir leaves
uhura see if you can get playback of the log want to know what happened here nurse attend to the wounded it many stories high and empty
scott to captain kirk
kirk here report mister scott
no drug
no drug and no dilithium shipment the hold is completely empty
all right report back up here
this screen is out sir but we can take the tapes and play them back on the enterprise
good nurse how is he
he needs surgery captain but he ll live
kirk to enterprise ready to beam over have the medical team standing by the beds are full now
how shea bones
he ll pull through jim what about spock if we don have that drug in twenty hours he ll die captain log stardate 6335 the huron has been left as space junk its engines sabotaged captain shea has no idea who attacked his ship but the intruder must be found and the precious cargo retrieved
ve run the huron sensor tapes through the computer sir the intruder ship is new design never before encountered by federation shipping
can we track it
yes sir the intruder ship produces unique trail of radioactive waste now bearing two one two degrees mark one seven five
lay in that course sulu ahead warp factor seven
how is he bones
not good jim ll have to put respirator on him to help him breathe soon
we re following the intruder ship trail
we don even know it it the right one
it got to be
what the use of being doctor anyway we re only as good as our drugs and technology make us underneath all the tricks might as well be practising in the middle ages
if you really believed that bones you wouldn still be doctor after twenty five years
report
radioactive residue still bearing two one two degrees mark one seven five
increase speed to warp eight
the trail goes through the asteroid belt captain
good place for an intruder to hide wouldn you say mister sulu
perfect and long range sensor can show that the radioactive residue stops in the middle of the belt
deflectors up yellow alert cut speed to warp one there an explosion outside
what was that
these asteroids are composed of highly unstable mineral combination sir they explode upon impact with each other
or anything else keep those deflectors up mister scott
captain if the power of those rocks could be harnessed they make fantastic source of energy
also make quite weapon steady as she goes sulu sailing through the asteroids beam hits the shields
deflectors holding sir
hard to port sulu let face them head on the red bat-ship comes on the viewscreen
hold position analysis mister sulu
standard phasers sir weak though diffused low quality beam our deflectors can stop them
recognise the ship markings captain it an orion
orion
they re hailing us captain
put it on visual lieutenant these orions are blue-skinned wearing green suits and half-helmets pursuit immediately must protest as representative of neutral planet
this is captain kirk for neutral you were pretty quick to fire your phasers
orion neutrality has been in dispute ever since the affair regarding the coridan planets and the babel conference of stardate 3850 yesterday federation freighter was attacked in this quadrant its cargo hijacked as the first alien ship encountered we require you to submit to search as per babel resolution a12 reply not thieves if you don cease this harassment we will lodge formal protest with your government
hold on that uhura tell them to stand by
sensors picking up the dilithium in their hold sir
what about the drug
if they have it it too small an amount to detect
uhura open the channel
channel open sir
enterprise to orion vessel have proposal to make if you do have the huron cargo there were some perishable drugs in it that we desperately need
what would these drugs be worth to you if we had them the whole incident to starfleet or in my log plus and additional galactic standard weight container of dilithium as payment for the drug
we get what we want plus our neutrality remains intact we will consider your offer
kirk to sickbay
bones how much time fast now
just hold out little longer
the orions are hailing us sir
put it on the screen lieutenant obvious we can
do you have counterproposal
face to face where
on the large asteroid near our ships we could beam down simultaneously and would hand you the drug myself you wouldn even have to give us the extra dilithium crystals now it your turn to consider
it got to be trap jim
no doubt of it sir
it could be trap but it the only way to get the drug and spock will die if we don
you ve already made up your mind haven you jim
yes but not without precautions ll keep my communicator channel open so you can hear what goes on keep the transporter locked on me and if anything goes wrong scotty trusting you
if this doesn work we could lose you and spock
if we don try spock doesn have chance
status lieutenant
we can outshoot the enterprise and we can outrun it sir
you re saying we can escape
no sir we can
orion official neutrality comes before this ship or its crew we can take kirk word that he won report this incident to starfleet
the only way to do that is to destroy the enterprise and the only way to do that is to destroy ourselves too
do you have plan lieutenant
yes sir these asteroids are made of highly explosive minerals
can we convert the asteroid we re orbiting into doomsday bomb that will destroy both ships
yes sir but
but what
analysis of the asteroid shows that it can be detonated by our phasers
what will it take
powerful explosive right on the asteroid surface could rig remote control device
no ll take it with me when beam down to meet captain kirk want the satisfaction of seeing his face when tell him he and his crew are going to die with us and sure they don trust us if kirk and are on the asteroid the enterprise will stay close by
very well sir ll get to work
enterprise to orion vessel
accept your terms in fifteen minutes
jim we don have lot of time spock
all right kirk out the two captains beam down with full life support fields on
the drug as promised captain scan it if you wish we can both beam up
no captain can trust that you won report this incident to starfleet if you do my planet will lose its neutrality and be subject to federation retaliation
you can escape the enterprise
but we can destroy it
picking up unusual sensor readings mister scott
what is it
there dilithium down there with them sir
have an explosive device in my backpack that will start molecular chain reaction and detonate this asteroid your ship will be destroyed
but so will yours
all unsuccessful orion missions end in suicide kirk grapples with him to stop him pressing the button on his belt
the dilithium transporter room pinpoint those crystals down there and beam them up
pinpointed mister scott the orion finally breaks free of kirk and presses the button nothing happens
scotty energise kirk grabs the orion again and they are beamed up scott and two security guards are there
captain it was close
let get up to the bridge
they re gone sir
gone
was scanning as you ordered and they just disappeared off the asteroid both the earther and the captain
he been captured no doubt arm our self-destruct system ensign
open hailing frequencies uhura the orion goes to put capsule in his mouth
grab him poison sure your ship is ready to self-destruct captain but if it does your crew will die for nothing we re not going to let you commit suicide whether they die or not you ll still stand trial and orion little game of neutrality and piracy is over
have the orion vessel sir
this is captain kirk we have your captain as prisoner your choice sir
disarm the self-destruct system prepare to surrender to the enterprise captain log stardate 6336 the orion crew is in our brig their ship in tow and the enterprise is back on course for deneb five
spock there no way you can deny it
doctor mccoy
ve waited long time for this and you re not going to cheat me
am interrupting something
nothing but doctor mccoy gloating
spock that green blood of yours may have saved you before but this time it almost did you in you can deny it
still prefer my physiological structure to yours
yes gentlemen things are back to normal
he as stubborn as ever laughs captain log stardate 5483 the enterprise is en route through an unfamiliar sector of space where series of earth federation ships have disappeared mysteriously during the last hundred and fifty years recent joint discussions with the klingon and romulan empires have revealed that starship has disappeared in this sector precisely every twenty seven point three four six star years
if my calculations are correct captain we have twenty seconds to go
twenty seconds to what that what worries me lieutenant uhura place the ship on yellow alert
aye sir yellow alert
five seconds four three
all stations report yellow alert status sir captain getting some sort of subspace radio signal
put it on ship speaker
it more like music than message
captain we are being probed
from where can you trace it
the signal is coming from star system twenty light years away
can you identify it
it is the taurean system small star at the extreme edge of this sector
that powerful signal to reach here from that great distance
it seems to be calling us
strange yes get the same feeling myself
it does resemble summons
find no resemblance to summons captain
opinion noted set course for the taurean system lieutenant arex warp factor seven later
you wanted me lieutenant are you all right
am but want you to observe the men here it seemed to start when we picked up that signal and it gotten worse
fascinating like vulcan marriage drum am experiencing audio-visual suggestion captain
so am they are seeing women with white hair
dimensional visions any idea what causing them spock
logically we must assume they are created by the probe
sir what visions we don see anything
miss chapel you don see anything either
no sir
take medical reading nurse lieutenant uhura call doctor mccoy to the bridge
sickbay doctor mccoy please report to the bridge doctor mccoy no response he seeing lovely things too
magnolias in blossom beautiful
the signal getting stronger sir
re-scan your sensor readings mister spock
readings are still inconclusive it is odd that only the men are affected captain suggest planet wobbles into view and the men go all misty the enterprise enters orbit
ship log stardate 5483 engineering officer scott in command we are in orbit around planet two in the taurean system probes and sensors indicate there was once vast civilisation here lovely lovely however life readings are sparse and concentrated captain kirk is beaming down with scouting party to investigate
these figures just don match up with spock so far count three sensor readings that are off building that looks like frozen flames
fantastic architecture only an incredibly advanced race could have built it
you want all those routine readings sir
no don think so carver spock will do it
there is something compelling about it
yes feel it too bones
captain the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion advise remaining at distance until can determine the extent of its influence the life forms are indicated in its centre
there no apparent danger spock let go the inner doors open to reveal bevy of beautiful white-haired blue-eyed women
they are here
oh such wondrous ones they honour us
am theela the head female welcome james kirk doctor mccoy mister spock welcome what the redshirt is suddenly invisible how rude
the form is humanoid but there are many internal differences their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level
first time ever admired body function
how do you know our names
the opto-aud revealed you to us she hums note and door slides back to reveal the enterprise on viewscreen including images of the bridge
tonal control fascinating
the opto-aud will reveal whatever is asked mister spock we are grateful that you heard the signal captain
the signal distress call wasn it
will explain its meaning later we have prepared feast to celebrate your presence captain log stardate 5483 the beauty of this place is unequalled it the answer to all of man dreams exquisite in every way we re here to investigate to investigate the women radiate delight the men are lounging on rugs being entertained
these are the most beautiful women in the galaxy but where are the men
they occupy another compound
that makes sense
mister spock she throws something to him he fails to catch it it hits his chest and he falls unconscious kirk tries to get up
spock they all fall over
take them to the slumber chambers they must rest
probably that nectar it potent as saurian brandy theela sheds single tear the men are awake again and wearing strange circlet around their heads mccoy seems older
jim jim kirk wakes on huge four-poster bed wearing circlet his face seems more lined than usual he tries to remove the circlet and fails
results of every scan run by the women science teams if there is an answer it here
computer on
summation of medical biological astrophysical scans
working probe directed at ship from planet surface is severely enervating to humanoid males exposure causes increasing weakness possibly to point of death
lieutenant uhura to security officer davison
want an all-woman security team on every transporter immediately no one is to transport down to the planet unless it is on my order
what are you doing
taking command of this ship the landing party are in front of theela sitting on raised throne
we must return to our duties aboard ship
yes duties that it duties have
you cannot leave mister spock you are needed here soon all the men on your ship will feel as you do they are all needed and they will join us
we must go
obstruct them the women easily overpower the men and throw them onto the cushions
singing dream of the gala lads can trow really can make much out
mister scott as senior lieutenant taking responsibility for the safety of this ship
very thoughtful of you love
ship log supplemental lieutenant uhura recording due to chief engineering officer scott euphoric state of mind am assuming command of the enterprise accept full responsibility for my action detailed account will be recorded later nurse chapel until further notice you will act as chief medical officer
yes lieutenant
they ve gone
yes your medikit doctor it may contain something which will help us
wonder why they let me keep it
perhaps they saw no practical use in it
cortropine could help it strong stimulant
go ahead at the door
locked
with medical scanner if the lock is magnetised this may disrupt its field the door opens enough for them to get out then theela enters
assistance assistance
the urn it the only place the men climb into giant sculptured urn to hide from the women
this way as the women get close the circlets on their heads glow
they are not here theela where they landed
the headbands look at them
have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not present they could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital energy to the bodies of the women
you mean they re actually draining our life forces
that would account for our rapid aging captain and our weakness if you recall the women seemed listless at first but as our strength has failed they have become more energetic and vital
how long do we have spock
we seem to be aging ten years per day captain
ten years in four days we ll be dead
and useless to them theela said the other men of the crew would join us here they ll be lured into the same trap we ve got to contact the ship
have retained more strength than any of you my internal structure is different captain my life span longer it is wiser if go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the ship there is no one around so spock hums the note and turns on the opto-aud
the equipment belonging to the men of the enterprise where is it the screen shows it to be in drawer under the throne
spock to enterprise he has been discovered
request rescue party all-female repeat all-female all he collapses ship log supplemental lieutenant uhura commanding we have assembled an all-female rescue party in accordance with mister spock request uhura and chapel beam down with four security women
greetings am theela head female of this compound
lieutenant uhura of the starship enterprise we re here to locate captain kirk
return to your ship you are not wanted here
until we find captain kirk we will not leave theela sends her troops in
phasers on stun fire the women drop like stones uhura shoots theela herself
search the temple parties of two
no sign of them anywhere from his bed spock sends telepathic message
wait
what is it
heard spock voice
it is spock there must be panel somewhere they find it
mister spock
spock what happened but he is incoherent it has started to rain
we ve got to get out of here chapel gets the circlet off the old wizened spock
spock oh spock
instruct female engineer to divert ship energy into deflector shields block probe
we tried that
use all ship energy everything channelled to the shields hurry christine the stunned women are coming round
release captain kirk and his men or we will destroy your temple
wait will tell you everything she turns on the opto-aud
the past reveal it images appear first male and female
this is the race from whom we are descended they came to this planet when our homeworld began to die they built this place and all surrounding it they did not know this planet drains humanoid energy but the women bodies developed glandular secretion enabling them to survive and to manipulate certain areas of the males brains influence their emotional senses ultimately it drained the men caused them to weaken and die meanwhile the urn is filling up with water and the men can get out
to survive we must vitalise each twenty seven years of your time
instead we are eternal prisoners we neither age nor die we are unable even to bear children
what about captain kirk and the others can the opto-aud locate them
we shall see the men of the enterprise reveal them it does
they re drowning where are they
the nearest water accumulation is many cusecs from here
that looks like pool or tub
it is the urn in the garden
phasers on setting one fire the urn is blown to bits and the men washed out unconscious chapel presses some buttons and golden glow appears around her patients
no results captain we ve tried everything we know
perhaps the transporter is the key
key to what
our restoration it holds the molecular pattern of our original bodies when we beamed down to the planet
spock can the transporter be programmed to re-pattern us as we were
possibly but the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to one the four old men are beamed down
we are on the surface mister scott reprogram the transporter as previously directed
but this has never been done before suppose it fails
their patterns ll break up scatter in space transporter reprogrammed mister spock
scotty we re losing them the four figures finally materialise
did it work
you re more handsome than ever theela destroys the transmitter
tell captain kirk we have kept the agreement
crew of women will bring ship back you ll be transported to the first suitable planet
how quickly will we become as other women
doctor mccoy says it should only take few months
life of hope new learning perhaps love oh it is much better future than immortality captain log stardate 5373 we are in orbit around the planet of the time vortex the focus of all the timelines of our galaxy our mission is to assist team of historians in the investigation of federation history at the big rock doughnut in the middle of the ruins mccoy woman with purple streak in her hair and giant yellow bird are waiting
the travellers are returning
cease review kirk and erikson the historiant appear
what trip bones orion at the dawn of its civilisation even just observing not touching anything for fear of changing some piece of history what the matter bones spock is standing in the middle of the guardian
who he jim
what do you mean who he you know mister spock
afraid don jim
kirk to enterprise
beam up four figures are beamed aboard
captain was expecting there to be one of the historians with you but vulcan
explain yourself mister scott
sir
don know what going on but the first officer of this ship will be treated with respect an andorian enters
captain assure you no one has ever treated me otherwise
who are you
oh thought sure you know thelin by now jim he been your first officer for five years
captain have come to the conclusion that this is not game
no but if it reality what happened captain log supplemental when we were in the time vortex something appears to have changed the present as we know it no one aboard recognises mister spock the only answer is that the past was somehow altered
nothing can find one thing we did when we were in the vortex that could possibly have affected the future
but something was changed
it seems captain am the only one affected the mission the ship the crew except for myself remain the same
but know who you are and no one else aboard does while we were in orion past the time revision that took place here didn affect me kirk here thelin asked for
your findings starfleet in any capacity
did you also research the vulcan family history requested relevant images sarek of vulcan ambassador to seventeen federation planets in the past thirty years
that is not correct
it is in this case
wish to ask question what of sarek family his wife and son couple separated after the death of their son on monitor the wife was killed in shuttle accident at lunaport on her way home to earth ambassador sarek has not remarried
my mother the son what was his name and age when he died
if we didn change anything while we were in the time vortex someone else must have was the guardian in use while we were gone
yes but it was nothing unusual we were scanning recent vulcan history
what time period
twenty to thirty vulcan years past
was there any notation on the death of ambassador sarek son
yes the boy is recorded as dying during the maturity test
the kahs-wan survival test traditional for young males
the date was
the twentieth day of tasmeen
how do you know this
that was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when was attacked by wild animal
this cousin what was his name
do not recall clearly was very young he called himself selek he was visiting us but never saw him after that
spock did selek look like you do now
believe so captain and know what you re thinking it was who saved myself that other time
but this time you were in orion past with us when the historians had the time vortex replay vulcan history you couldn be in two places at once so you died as boy guardian did you hear that
hear all
is it possible for spock to return to vulcan and repair the timeline that has been broken so all is the same as before
it is possible if no other major factor is changed
do not remember everything there is vague memory from child point of view but the details are not clear
you have to remember for you and your mother to live
yes will need vulcan desert soft suit and boots and small selection of streetwear circa 8877 vulcan years the carry bag should be of the same period
you ve got it ll order the wardrobe section to prepare it now
this change in the timeline will put you in my place yet am not aggrieved
andorians are not known for their charity
true warrior race has few sympathies but one we do possess is for family in your time plane you will live and so will your mother that is valuable live long and prosper in your world commander spock
and you in yours commander thelin the carry bag is beamed down
nice to know the crew is efficient in this time plane too spock
wish to visit the planet vulcan thirty years past the month of tasmeen location near the city of shirkahr
the time and place are ready to receive you personal log stardate 5373 subjective time have returned to the past in an attempt to restore the future am home and had almost forgotten its beauty spock watches group of children verbally bullying another
earther barbarian emotional earther you re terran spock you could never be true vulcan
that is not true my father
your father brought shame to vulcan he married human young spock lunges at him but they dodge him easily
you haven even mastered simple vulcan neck pinch yet earther
my apologies visitor regret you were witness to that unfortunate display of emotion on the part of my son
in the family all is silence no more will be said of it live long and prosper sarek of vulcan
peace and long life you are of my family
my name is selek an humble cousin descended of pel and sasak am journeying to the family shrine to honour our gods
you have long way to go will you break your journey with us for while cousin
am honoured is something wrong cousin
no no it was only that it seemed know you
family resemblance to our forefathers no doubt
no doubt well come then allow me to welcome you to my home sarek calls spock away from his enormous pet sehlat big furry thing with large fangs
spock spock being vulcan means following disciplines and philosophies that are difficult and demanding of both mind and body
yes father
you constantly display your emotions you have even been seen fighting in the street
yes father
the time draws near when you will have to decide whether you will follow vulcan or human philosophy vulcan offers much no war no crime order logic and control in place of raw emotions and instinct once on the path you choose you cannot turn back
yes father
hope you were not disturbed by my son behaviour selek
no my lady amanda any child has much to learn my young cousin has more difficult road to travel than others
you seem to understand him better than my husband
it is difficult for father to bear less than perfection in his son spock will find his way
hops so respect vulcan and all its traditions but it is demanding life
the boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon does he not
next month
but tomorrow is the twentieth day of tasmeen
yes is something wrong
seem to have lost track of time
soon you will undergo your test of adulthood in the desert to survive for ten days without food water or weapon on vulcan forge will demand more of you than anything ever has to fail once is not disgrace for others if you fail there will be those who will call you coward all your life do not expect you to fail
what if do father
there is no need to ask that question you will not disappoint me not if your heart and spirit are vulcan sarek leaves and young spock goes to his pet
i-chaya what if not true vulcan like they say
dictating personal log stardate 5373 subjective time the timeline seems to have changed again yet do not believe have done anything to disrupt it my memory is quite clear regarding the date my cousin saved my life and it is tomorrow the kahs-wan ordeal is an ancient rite of warrior days when vulcans turned to logic they reasoned they must maintain the tests of courage and strength to keep pure logic from making them weak and helpless young spock has snuck out and his pet wants to go with him
no i-chaya this is my own test have to do it alone stay but the sehlat bounds after him anyway
of course should have remembered it wasn the actual kahs-wan ordeal
i-chaya go home you are too old and too fat for this whimper that how you always get around mother but it does not work with me go home i-chaya personal log the boy spock should be moving toward the llangon mountains he had much to prove to myself the personal ordeal upon which embarked was meant to determine the course my life would take
sarek our son and the visitor are gone
this cousin selek something strange about him
you don think he harm spock
don know amanda will notify the authorities and ask them to initiate search up in the mountains i-chaya is protecting young spock by taking on green cat-like predator for him but the cat kills the sehlat then spock leaps on the cat back and neck-pinches it
i-chaya good boy
suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya regains consciousness
thank you for helping me and i-chaya
it was my duty spock
mother says you should always say thank you
the lady amanda is known for her graciousness
do you think ll ever be able to do that neck pinch as well as you
dare say you will come now they walk on
you followed me why
suspected you would go you are worried about the kahs-wan ordeal
had to see if could do it personal test cannot fail
that is your father wish
yes and my mother they they confuse me father wants me to do things his way and mother says should but then she goes
she is human woman with strong emotion and sensitivities she embarrasses you with those traits and you are afraid when you see them in yourself
how did you know
there is some human blood in my family line it is not fatal what you do not yet understand spock is that vulcans do not lack emotion it is only that ours is controlled logic offers serenity humans seldom experience in full we have emotions but we deal with them and do not let them control us i-chaya collapses with whimper
i-chaya
the le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight
is he dying
yes personal log something unexpected has again occurred the sehlat i-chaya was struck by the poisonous claws of the le-matya he fought he is dying unless we can find healer and soon
we cannot get him back to the city to healer he is too large to move
then what
you are vulcan what is the logical thing to do
can bring healer here
it is long journey across the desert there are many dangers will go
no this is my duty no one else can do it for me will you stay with him young spock heads back to the city
this did not happen before my life decision was made without the sacrifice of yours old friend know there is pain can help little sleep now young spock avoids carnivorous plant and makes it back to the city
the hour is late trust your errand is urgent
most urgent healer my sehlat fought le-matya in the llangon foothills he suffered small wound but the poison of its claws is working in him now please you must come with me he needs your healing
you are spock son of sarek are you not
yes healer
have heard of you have heard of tendency toward what humans call practical jokes
did that once two years ago healer would not call you out unless life was in danger have you ever heard the son of sarek was liar
no that has never been said very well wait here and will get my medicines
healer please hurry the healer and young spock arrive in hover-car
it will not be long now old friend as i-chaya is tended
you made the desert crossing most efficiently you will not disappoint sarek in your kahs-wan
wanted only to help i-chaya he was my father before he was mine to lose him
vulcan would face such loss without tears
how
by understanding every life comes to an end when time demands it loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted i-chaya was not
spock
yes sir
it has been too long no antidote known will save his life
is there nothing you can do
can prolong his life but he will be in pain or can release him from life will need your decision he is your pet
release him it is fitting he dies with peace and dignity and so i-chaya goes to sleep in young spock arms
regret having troubled you in any way but it was necessary
trust you can explain why it was necessary
there was decision to be made direction for my life had to be chosen chose vulcan
it is good then you have comported yourself with honour we will see i-chaya is brought home from the mountains
thank you father if you will excuse me now have some business to conduct with schoolmates
business
demonstration of the vulcan neck pinch our cousin taught me
too must make my farewells your hospitality has been most kind but must journey on
you saved my son life selek there is no way can fully repay you for that
try to understand your son sarek of vulcan it will be repayment enough for me
strange request but will honour it my home is yours if you pass this way again
think shall not peace and long life
live long and prosper cousin
the traveller is returning
sent the others up to the ship what happened
one small thing was changed this time pet died
pet well that wouldn mean much in the course of time
it might to some
enterprise this is the captain two to beam up
well well well so you two finally got back from your vacation while you ve been running all over orion creation ve been running the annual crew physicals you re the last ones
welcome aboard mister spock
never mind the chit-chat ve got my medical scanners all set up for vulcan have to recalibrate every time run physical on you spock
doctor mccoy you do not know your good fortune if the times were different you would have to recalibrate for an andorian
what that supposed to mean if that was supposed to be joke spock have to remind you vulcans don tell jokes
times change doctor times change captain log stardate 5392 the enterprise has been assigned to escort two robot grain ships to sherman planet which has been struck by crop failures and famine this shipment of seed grain quintrotriticale is necessary to the survival of the colonists we are breaking course to sherman planet to investigate what appears to be klingon battle cruiser pursuing some kind of smaller ship observation may confirm rumour that the klingons have new weapon type so far unknown
captain it is klingon ship rapidly closing on its target
sensors indicate the smaller vessel is one-man scout ship of common design
they re firing on him explosions happen around the little ship
klingon battle cruiser identify yourself ahead warp factor six scotty lock the transporter on that small vessel we re going to rescue that pilot
locking on finally the klingons manage to hit the fleeing ship
open hailing frequencies klingon battle cruiser identify yourself you are violating federation space identify yourself stop firing on scout ship lots more misses
arm all phasers deflector shields up
phasers armed shields up
ahead warp factor eight klingon battle cruiser identify yourself at last they blow up the scout ship
they got him
scotty have you got that pilot yet
that klingon mutter that blast decalibrated the integration parameters
captain the klingon ship is coming straight for them red alert sounds wibbly energy field is fired at enterprise
the new weapon spock
some kind of field effect captain it will hit us in precisely four seconds it produces most remarkable the weapon hits disruption
now what he mutters and works the controls
our engines are dead
captain we have been hit by kind of projected stasis field our matter-antimatter generators are disabled we are paralysed
fire phasers
the phasers don work sir
the photon torpedoes will not respond either the stasis field disables all higher-order field and warp functions
well we could always throw rocks
this new klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it can immobilize starship the energy drain on the klingon ship would be enormous
scotty did you get that pilot
but can integrate him the system been discoordinated
captain have message coming in sir
put it on the viewscreen
release my ship turn over the pilot of the little ship
that ship was federation-built craft the pilot is under our protection to take him by force will
the first klingon to step aboard this ship will be the last klingon full security alert mister spock phasers no longer work nor any of your weapons
mister spock losing contact with our robot ships they re not held by the stasis field and they re moving out of range
what was that lieutenant cut off that frequency
yes sir koloth is cut off the robot ships they re moving off
they still have power we still control them
affirmative sir
bring them back mister sulu have them ram the klingon ship
captain you can afford to lose that grain
can afford even less to lose the enterprise open the hailing frequency again lieutenant captain koloth going to give you one last chance to release the enterprise the message about the ships it won work captain kirk transmission ends
it will work or he still be gloating bring the robot ships in from two different angles mister sulu the klingons fire two more stasis beams
incredible the amount of energy that field must require the new beams fail to reach their targets then they all fail and enterprise is free
they couldn maintain the stasis field
keep your phasers locked on target mister sulu hold your fire until they fire first
aye sir phasers locked on the klingons fire at robot ship
apparently their battle capacity is down they only damaged it
they re veering off
sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted they probably don have the strength for prolonged battle now
scotty can you integrate that pilot now
think so captain
call mccoy to the transporter room spock
have you got him
just putting him together now sir chubby figure solidifies together with three piles of small pink fluffy objects
think we know that man
it appears to be
don want to think about it
cyrano jones
and he got tribbles with him tribbles captain log supplemental our rescue effort has given us some knowledge of the new klingon weapon and the presence of cyrano jones intergalactic trader and general nuisance
captain kirk friend kirk
seal off the area ensign you know the law about transporting animals proven harmful
captain these are safe tribbles
there no such thing as safe tribble
safe tribble would be contradiction in terms tribbles are well known for their proclivities in multiplication
and they breed fast too and that why these tribbles are safe they don reproduce
don reproduce
ve had them genetically engineered for compatibility with humanoid ecologies see how friendly and loveable they are and not baby in the bunch they re great pets and profitable too
jones how did you get away from space station k7 you were supposed to clean up all the tribbles there
oh well managed short parole found some help this is tribble predator it called glommer he holds up pyramid-shaped thing with four legs six horns and two eyes on long stalks
watch the glommer pounces over tribble and we don get to see the details
well at least it neat
why were the klingons chasing you jones
how should know klingons have notoriously bad tempers
that may be true but they rarely enter federation space and fire on federation vessels without reason
they did mention ecological sabotage
me saboteur ridiculous
captain koloth was pretty emphatic
it was such little thing can understand at all why they got upset
what did you do
only sold them some tribbles
you sold tribbles on klingon planet
well didn know it was klingon planet
tribbles don like klingons that should have given you some clue
klingons like tribbles even less it was lucky you came along and saved me when you did friend kirk couldn have outrun them much longer
according to our computer files jones you are in violation of three federation mandates and forty seven local ones you re confined until we complete our mission then we ll turn you over to the proper authorities
captain couldn we talk this over didn think so if you re the only person in the universe who is reading this and does not know about the trouble with tribbles click the link and learn mccoy is examining pink tribble
jim cyrano jones is right these tribbles don reproduce they just get fat don think we have anything to worry about
not about tribbles anyway am concerned about that new klingon weapon
it is an energy-sapping field of great strength captain it immobilizes starship and its weapons capability but apparently it also immobilizes the attacking ship abilities at the same time
aye and if that true then it weapon that leaves them as helpless as it does us
believe just said that mister scott
the practical advantages of such weapon would seem to be limited
perhaps but there are logical applications the key question is how long does it take them to recharge they will probably attack us again as soon as they are back up to power and they will probably begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating the same trick they want cyrano jones very badly
he really doesn seem the saboteur type jim
yes status report on the damaged grain ship scotty
well sir we ve managed to transfer all the grain aboard but it severely limits us we filled the shuttlecraft hangars all our extra holds and we ve even got containers of that wheat that quintrotriticale in the corridors of the ship and then we ve got that other robot ship to escort too don like it at all sir
nor do mister scott but we ve got to do it sherman planet needs that grain desperately
aye sir but we ve got tribbles on the ship quintrotriticale in the corridors klingons in the quadrant it can ruin your whole day sir and big fat pink tribbles are sniffing around the containers so big and fat that the glommer cannot quite cope with them
captain sensors are picking up klingon battle cruiser
deflector shields up stand by phasers rolls tribble off his chair how fat do these things get
klingon ship approaching rapidly within phaser range in thirty seconds
obviously they can recharge their power in matter of hours
use the robot ship as decoy have it change course and move off we ll use it again to give the klingons trouble they can control more than one ship at time with their stasis field
beginning evasive manoeuvres
the klingon seems to be veering off my mistake captain they were not veering off they were attacking the grain ship
but they didn destroy it they only wrecked the propulsion units they left the cargo intact
captain koloth is quite marksman
they ve changed course they re coming in again
ready phasers
phasers armed and ready sir the klingons fire two shots at enterprise the shaking of the ship makes some containers fall over and break open kirk returns fire then comes an attempt with the stasis beam meanwhile little pink tribbles are becoming giant pink tribbles
photon torpedoes fire one
they re running away very odd they did not use their stasis weapon at all
perhaps they haven had enough time to recharge it
or the purpose of the attack was something else
they disabled the robot ship
scotty put tractor beam on it we ll take it in tow
captain that could be exactly what they want us to do tow the robot and limit our available power we re carrying the extra mass of the first ship cargo and now we have the second one in tow that requires great deal of power we won be able to use in battle
that seems logical
thank you
well mister spock do you have any ideas
we could always throw tribbles at them
thought vulcans didn have sense of humour
we don captain the glommer looks like jockey on the back of tribble
captain we ve got broken cargo containers in all the corridors and the tribbles are eating the grain
get cyrano jones up here
aye sir
any sign of captain koloth ship
nothing sir
keep scanning
captain kirk what can do for you some spican flame gems perhaps
your tribbles are all over my ship my security men can find them all
you need better security men captain
mister jones you are in enough trouble already
captain harmless little tribble what can they hurt
harmless maybe little pushes beach ball off his seat in any case they re eating the quintrotriticale
the what
the wheat
they re hungry captain
so are the people on sherman planet little tribble doesn eat much big tribble does and these are growing jones is this the ecological sabotage the klingons are so mad about
captain the klingons are coming back
speak of the devil mccoy enters
jim there something about these tribbles
later bones pushes one nearly as big as himself off his chair mister sulu release the robot ship we ll swing back and pick it up later deflector shields up stand by photon torpedoes and all noncombatants off the bridge captain log supplemental the klingon ship under command of captain koloth is forcing us into battle for custody of cyrano jones for reasons still unknown
contact in thirty seconds
ready photon torpedoes fire one
one fired the klingons fire their stasis beam destroying the torpedo and grabbing the enterprise
that done it we re caught
message coming in sir ship now
not if can help it
much as hate to admit it captain koloth cyrano jones is citizen of the federation and entitled to federation protection must much as it pains me refuse your request steps that we will both regret
close channel lieutenant
with pleasure sir
aren you going to sit down sir the pink tribble on the captain chair is definitely bigger than kirk now
think ll stand
implement boarding plan
yes sir
mister scott we re going to implement emergency defence plan
plan sir
mister spock suggested it the boarding hatches open and giant pink tribbles enter the klingon ship the klingons are horrified
emergency plan complete sir
open hailing frequencies lieutenant captain koloth are you ready to release my ship
you don know yet do you
that we have immobilized your ship worse than you have immobilized ours except some undue transporter activity and tribble rolls behind him kirk tribbles
tribbles
kirk cyrano jones took klingon genetic construct an artificial creature from one of our planets we must have it back it was designed to be tribble predator we are prepared to go to war if we have to
you must have others order to grow others from it we need it to get rid of the tribbles
jones sold before they completely overrun the planet
and that all you want
we must have the glommer
oh well if that all mister scott transport the glommer over to the klingon ship
you can do this to me under space salvage laws he mine
planetary surface is not covered by space salvage laws but if you want the little beastie that bad mister jones we ll transport you over with it
withdraw my claim the glommer is transported and the stasis beam is switched off
well at least we can report the stasis field is not as effective weapon as we thought the power drain is too high and takes too long for the klingon ship to recover to make it practical
agreed captain tribbles appear to be much more effective weapon monster tribble is amongst the wheat containers
jones genetic engineering was very slipshod jim he may have kept the tribbles from reproducing but he didn slow down their metabolism you see they re not just giant tribbles they re colonies
captain the engine room is filled with tribble
well we can do something about that to the glommer attack but the door opens and it is full of one tribble the glommer retreats
he did it to us again that tin-plated overbearing excuse for starship captain did it to us again blast that thing so they shoot the big tribble which becomes an avalanche of little tribbles
any other orders sir
up to his neck in tribbles yes don do that again ever
simple shot of neoethylene will fix everything the tribble colonies will break down into their individual units with slower metabolic rate and these really will be safe tribbles now
er what about the klingons
well unless they treat their tribbles too that ship isn going to be big enough for all of them
looking up jefferies tube say you didn get this one bones
oh yes did
but it hasn then it did someday ll learn
aye captain but you ve got to admit if we ve got to have tribbles it best if all our tribbles are little ones captain log stardate 7403 the enterprise is on series of exploratory and contact missions travelling with us as an independent observer is member of recently contacted alien species honorary commander ari bn bem he from the planet pandro in the garo seven system we have taken up orbit around delta theta three newly discovered class planet previous scouting mission has reported possible aboriginal life forms here and the enterprise is to investigate and report enterprise is orbiting very green planet
sensors report several groupings of aborigines they may be dangerous so want all of us to avoid any unnecessary risks but these monitoring devices have to be planted lieutenant uhura will be tracking us throughout now if there any trouble of any kind beam up immediately don try to be hero
aye sir bem is green upright biped in jumpsuit with red crest and slit irises to his eyes not quite the bug eyed monster his name implies
kirk captain settings are almost complete
commander bem what are you doing here
this one has decided to accompany contact team for observation of same
commander bem you were assigned to this ship as an independent observer yet you have spent the past six missions in your quarters you haven done any observing at all until now when we re dealing with possibly very dangerous planet
patience every planet is dangerous to the ignorant this one has decided that the nexus is now must observe workings of starship and crew
this mission is not for casual observers it could be hazardous
am prepared
commander bem this is not joyride pleasure excursion cannot let you beam down to the planet without adequate protection sure you understand the diplomatic consequences if anything were to happen to you while you are under my protection
understanding it is captain but this one remains adamant am prepared to accompany
this is an odd time to remain adamant all right let go there planet waiting for us
this one has already set controls mister scotty
everything appears to be all right sir co-ordinates are locked on the landing site
energise three of the party materialise at the edge of lake but kirk and spock materialise over the water and fall in bem jumps in after them
assistance is offered underwater bem lower half walks around the back of kirk and spock and two sinuous arms take their phasers and communicators replacing them with fakes
we re all right back on dry land
in the future commander bem you will leave the operation of the transporter to mister scott or one of the regular transporter crew
captain lieutenant uhura reports some peculiar activity here on the planet
taking scott communicator what is it lieutenant
lieutenant arex has been tracking non-network sensory stasis it hardly more than flicker and it several thousand kilometres west of your position
an anomaly sir it resembles sensor field but without scanning grid or other point of reference
brownian movement only captain no discernible direction
the implication is that there is something else on this planet perhaps something intelligent
it might be just an atmospheric effect some kind of electrical storm we ve seen unidentified planetary phenomena before that have resembled intelligent activity put the ship on yellow alert we ll continue the contact mission for now but notify us immediately if there any change in the situation kirk out the landing party is walking along
the rain forest is especially thick in his district life on this planet appears to be geologically younger than one would expect given the age of this star something is watching them
this one is picking up readings of large group of life forms directly ahead
all right we must take care not to be seen hey bem bem come back scotty sulu stay here with the monitoring devices come on spock they give chase
he won get far in there
let go but bem divides into several smaller pieces and floats through the tangle of stems and trunks with ease before rejoining into one
he gone
he would have had to go through here to escape
there he is don know how he did it but he got through come on we ll have to go around that pandronian actions just don make sense
they might to another pandronian captain believe he went that way captain on the other hand
think we ve lost him that way bem is surrounded by lizard people with spears
it appears to be native food-gathering party
yes and the food they have gathered is bem
lieutenant uhura reading increased activity on the surface of the planet the sensory anomaly appears to be expanding
contact the landing party
commander scott here bem ran off for some reason they re in the forest
the captain is not answering his communicator and it does not show up on the scanning grid it as if its responder has been disconnected we re picking up increased activity from that anomaly is mister spock with the captain
aye they both went after commander bem
lieutenant arex start sensor scan for captain kirk and mister spock landing party prepare to beam up
sorry mister scott that not procedure we can take chances
we re talking about the captain
know it but we have to follow his orders stand by to beam up
standing by kirk and spock are still hiding in foliage
maybe we can beam him out of there kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise this isn my communicator
these are not enterprise communicators captain they are fakes excellent but non-working forgeries
this communicator been on my belt since we beamed down
our phasers don work either
our phasers and communicators have been switched for phonies and commander bem has run off we ve been separated from the rest of the landing party mister spock something funny is going on
an alternate course of action would appear to be advisable
but commander bem difficulty appears to be genuine phasers or not we have to rescue him we re going to have to follow them bem is being marched away by the lizard people
one of us could go back to contact mister scott
we can risk it not while they re moving we may never be able to find them again later they are lying on hill overlooking wicker and thatched hut village
these aborigines appear to be in late primitive state obviously intelligent they seem to have basic language and social structure would assume fairly well developed mores and traditions as well
commander bem seems to be model prisoner bem is in small wooden cage just big enough to stand up and turn around in
we ll have to wait until nightfall
kirk captain
shut up we re rescuing you
you are interfering with observations
this is how you observe by being captured
as logical way as any spock commander
opening the door don think starfleet would approve come on but the lizard people have caught them
uh oh kirk and spock have their own personal cages
how come we always end up like this
assume that rhetorical question captain not requiring an answer
was just expressing my curiosity at our ability to get into these kind of situations
fate captain fate
fate spock
believe that is the correct earth term
why don you try your vulcan nerve pinch
captain am only vulcan there are limits
commander bem afraid that we re not going to be able to rescue you
good intentions kirk captain are not enough planet pandro will be much displeased starfleet told us you are best captain in fleet actions to date belie this
commander bem you are responsible for the situation we are in you disobeyed orders by running off your attitude has been extremely abrasive and don know how you did it you replaced our phasers and communicators with phonies
you place too much dependence kirk captain on phasers and communicators
either one could solve our problems right now
if that is all taking the items out of his pockets
commander bem if you had those two phasers and those communicators all this time why didn you use them to escape
sir this one does not demean oneself by the use of casual violence to accomplish goals but you may demean yourself if you wish
want those phasers and communicators now
compliance with orders is this one must disassemble and while his top half hangs in mid air bem lower half runs over to kirk and small arms hand over the phasers and communicators
fascinating spock is given his equipment
remarkable commander bem is colony creature
commander bem if you could split yourself into separate parts why didn you escape on your own earlier
and deny you the opportunity to prove your value to planet pandro by rescuing this one from possibly dangerous situation
this is not laboratory commander bem this is hostile planet and representatives of starfleet are not experimental animals for you to test consider yourself under arrest protective custody to keep you from any more escapades mister spock keep watch
lieutenant arex have you found them yet
no sir it is big planet
mister scott that sensory anomaly it expanded to cover the whole northern continent
what that
we can get any readings at all now
aye that tears it the loch ness monster couldn get through that {kirk spock and bem are hiding behind hut
there some kind of interference on all channels we re going to have to get out of this village on our own
doubt we ll be able to do so without being seen captain
concur mister spock set phasers to stun just in case they are spotted
fire but dark red glow envelopes them
no do not use your weapons
paralysed
we re held in stasis captain
put away your weapons these are my children do not harm them
who are you
who are you
am captain james tiberius kirk of the starship enterprise this is my first officer mister spock and honorary commander ari bn bem of the planet pandro
why are you here why do you disturb this place
it is our mission we must classify this planet we have to test it
classify what gives you the right to intrude here this planet is not for your use my children are not for your tests your weapons will be nullified the phasers disappear and the glow stops
there are times mister spock when think should have been librarian
the job of librarian would be no less challenging captain but it would undoubtedly be lot less dangerous
have you found the captain yet
have located emanations that could be captain kirk and another set that could be mister spock but the sensory anomaly has interfered with our detection devices so that positive identification remains impossible
which means
think he said maybe well that convinces me ready security squad we re going down there issue phaser rifles kirk spock and bem are back in their cages
you have mishandled situation again kirk captain this one judges you not an intelligent commander
commander bem mister spock and are here because we thought that you were worth rescuing it was more to preserve the diplomatic relations between the federation and planet pandro than from any great affection for yourself
planet pandro is unconcerned as to fate of this one pandro will not have dealings with inefficient and inferior species you have failed everything you have attempted you have not rescued this one and you have not been able to handle local aborigines bem splits himself up and walks over to kirk cage
this one wishes you what is the earth word luck you will require it and he or they walk away
wait unlock us set us free
captain perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien intelligence and reason with it
it worth try into communicator kirk to alien intelligence this is captain james tiberius kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet answer me please
perhaps an offering of some sort captain
mister spock whatever we re dealing with don think we can bribe it we must be honest kirk to alien intelligence don think it strong enough to be noticeable
hmm if we connect our two communicators in series we can give off high energy burst which might work but it will also render the communicators powerless in very short time
do it kirk throws his communicator to spock and gets it back with the other stuck to it very quickly
this is captain james tiberius kirk calling the ruling intelligence of this planet do you hear me kirk to entity kirk to entity
am here
we apologise for intruding we did not realise the situation we will leave we will tell others of our kind not to bother you here
this is good go go now and do not return
just one thing there is third member of our group
detect no third intelligence
he has fled
you must go you must not interfere with my children will allow you to contact your ship go now
kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise
stand by we re not leaving without bem he is our responsibility we can leave him here beam down security squad with heavy duty tricorders set for pandronian scanning four figures materialise
captain are you all right scott phasers the cage open
thanks scotty spread out find commander bem he split into three individual parts
beg pardon sir
he some kind of colony creature and take care not to injure any of the natives here phasers on lightest possible stun setting and don fire unless absolutely necessary no sooner do they spread out to search than the lizard people attack they have captured bem the starfleet people use their phasers and the lizard people drop their spears and flee
let get out of here before we make any more trouble
embarrassment results this one is shamed this one has failed in its judgement
you have endangered all of us by your actions and you have forced us to interfere with the natives of planet that deserves prime directive protection
this one exists by its own standards
not on my ship you don
you are still here you are still interfering am angered
we could not leave one of our own behind it is our responsibility to take care of our own just as it is your responsibility to take care of yours we could not leave him here where he might further interfere with your your children
yes you have some wisdom james tiberius kirk the lost one is found then
he is found and we will leave
this one has greatly erred the mission was to judge and right of judgement was not conferred this one must disassemble unity
disassemble
never to exist again as co-operation this unity is defective this unity must cease to exist
no do not destroy yourself
but this one has erred this one has tried to judge kirk and spock and been found wanting himself this one has acted badly
yes you have erred but if you disassemble you cannot learn from your error errors demand recognition so that they will not be repeated
you do not demand punishment
punishment what is punishment revenge intelligent beings need no revenge punishment is necessary only where learning cannot occur without it you are behind that my children here are not that is why you must leave so as not to corrupt their development with concepts that they are not yet ready for
am humbled
we will go now
yes
kirk to enterprise beam us up
stand by to break orbit mister spock classify this planet as being strictly quarantined under no circumstances may any federation vessel approach
pandro will respect that also
captain compliment you on wise decision
it is necessary not only for them but for us as well
fascinating captain highly advanced alien entity using this particular system as laboratory for guiding another race to intelligence almost god you might say
mister spock the difference is meaningless in comparison we re all still children
in this one case kirk captain this one is still an eggling
take us out of orbit mister sulu let go home
captain picking up message
put it on audio lieutenant uhura
go in peace yes go in peace you have learned much be proud captain log stardate 4978 we are approaching the arcadian star system on mission to locate an old friend
do you think harry mudd is down there spock
the probability of his presence on motherlode is eight one percent plus or minus point five three
why can you just say mudd probably there
just did doctor
approaching parking orbit captain
very well mister arex spock let see how close your percentage is harry mudd is giving his spiel to an audience of
now you re all heavy metal miners shrewd and intelligent so you can appreciate the incredible value offering with this magical liquid no person of the opposite sex can resist you it matters not whether you are young old fat ugly or repugnant kirk and spock beam down
nothing personal gentle beings
proof human
proof behold lovely blonde lady walks up to him
harry darling was lonely for you
behold placed single drop of this miracle substance on meself then simply touched this young lady
please darling come back to the ship with me
how much
three hundred credits or the
three hundred
bargain sir true love is worth any price captain kirk and the ineluctable mister spock welcome to motherlode gentlemen interested in purchasing little love
we re interested in you harry for fraud illegal drug manufacture and swindling
as said welcome to motherlode charming planet which does not recognise federation law
so you two can keep out of this all right mudd you ve got deal
are you aware that harry mudd is tricking you via an illusion
what spock fires his phaser at the girl which turns into reptile
the so-called girl is rigelian hypnoid projecting simple illusion uproar
now friends
we can arrest you harry but you can give yourself up
no
thief the audience start throwing stones
surrender myself with free will mercy of the law spock phasers ditch and rampart between themselves and the mob
ah that was miching trick kirk you ve cost me me ship everything own even the love crystals may just sue you
fine ll see you in court harry chapel tends to where harry got hit by rock
minor bruise captain he ll live
thought we left you on the robot planet harry permanently
never underestimate the spirit of harcourt fenton mudd borrowed vehicle
stole spaceship
and left to find haven on ilyra six charming planet an innocent and friendly populace
to whom you sold the starfleet space academy harry
fraud but sold for enough credits to get to sirius nine
where discovered boon to humanoid life miracle love potion
which you sold to thousand inhabitants who immediately became ill from using it
hadn counted on their unusual biochemistry so did the logical thing left in haste
and came here to swindle honest miners
the love potion works captain if you ll allow me to procure some from my ship but they leave and activate the forcefield immediately outside the brig
prepare the arrest report mister spock kirk leaves spock shall require medical report on the prisoner miss chapel
of course mister spock think you deserve congratulations for trapping him so cleverly
you exaggerate nurse kindly see that your medical summary is more precise spock leaves
your mister spock is really very attractive intelligence
an efficient officer yes
but trifle lacking in the warmer emotions now you nurse you have wonderful gift to heal the wounded fantastic touch womanly feminine quality appreciate that and should like to well thank you he offers her crystal
what is it
my love potion not illusion not trickery dear nurse chapel inside this crystal lies the power to create love
no no ve heard of your potions before don believe you
think about it darling mister spock in love with you
an uncharted star system ahead captain
binary sun with class planet that rare enough to warrant investigation
agreed take us into orbit lieutenant arex
it really so simple my dear you rub the liquid on yourself then touch another person
and it creates love in that person mudd that is totally absurd
no it is infallible one touch evokes friendship between men or women but between woman and man love guaranteed you re not simply beautiful woman you are scientist urge you to take this love crystal as my gift of gratitude to you take it dear nurse chapel and conduct your own experiment
not that believe you but well suppose could analyse it
of course
parking orbit stable weapons systems on defensive standby
no evidence of intelligent life atmosphere at surface eight hundred millibars breathable gravity one point two temperature hot but within class limits the forcefield is down so mudd can give chapel the crystal
ll let you know the results of my analysis
laboratory tests would destroy it my dear why not test it the way it meant to be used
no
ah darling think if it does what say it does spock will be yours forever my dear
just break the capsule and rub it on my skin
and then touch him she breaks the capsule between her hands and gasps
what is it
temporary effect as the liquid is absorbed he steps into the corridor to catch her as she wobbles and take her pouch
it ll pass
feel better
didn tell you
you should you should be in the brig harry
oh right you are darling he steps back in and she reactivates the forcefield
why don you go find spock can waste any time you know
yes ll do that harry uses what he stole from christine to get out of the brig and change her photo-id card so he is now lieutenant christine chapel
yes nurse
brought the medical summary for the arrest report mister spock she stumbles and ends up sitting on his lap
sorry sir
are you injured miss chapel
no no fine are you feeling all right
perfectly normal will append your summary to the report was there something else miss chapel
wouldn you like me to well stay help you
that would be illogical miss chapel
yes yes it be stupid
harry mudd you swindling she goes to the brig and finds it empty then she discovers the pouch is empty too
oh no
harry mudd triumphant again as he surveys the array of shuttlecraft available to him
and appended hereto is medical summary by nurse christine chapel ah nurse chapel sweet summary dear lovely christine chapel karate-chops harry to the floor and gets her possessions back
ve come to collect on your guarantee mister mudd
captain doctor wish to report er number of very strange um emotions
what
what
you re implying the potion was not completely successful
oh no it was made complete fool of myself
but you know how cold vulcans are perhaps it takes bit more time for spock to
you re the same fraud you ve always been harry don know how could have believed you
well let discuss it rationally my dear let not be hasty
don panic harry this phaser is set on stun not kill activate the intercom
now wait minute perhaps that particular crystal was defective here try another assure you
stop it she fires missing harry but hitting the crystals which then evaporate into the ventilation system then she sets off the red alert mudd overpowers her
sorry christine but shall require temporary hostage
internal security captain
put it on screen
shuttlecraft bay they see harry carry chapel into shuttlecraft
mudd and he has christine she in danger my love everyone stares arex whistles the shuttlecraft launches
he going planet side
no not with my christine
relax darling ll set you down somewhere safe and then ll be off discreetly
we must go after them captain ll lead landing party
spock you re obviously not yourself maybe some rest
captain insist upon going christine can stand the thought of any danger to her to the woman love
love
spock
yes want to protect her hold her in my arms
then ll transport down with you
good spock leaves
jim is that wise in his condition
try and stop him it better if go with him kirk leaves
spock in love
can imagine then the love vapour comes through the vents
love captain log supplemental harry mudd has escaped from the enterprise taking head nurse chapel with him apparently as hostage meanwhile mister spock is acting very strange
come on hurry if he harmed one hair on her pretty head
jim the search party found this in the shuttlecraft bay
one of mudd love crystals
captain number of these were broken against the ship air system grill
lucky for us they don work
are we sure jim number of the crew are acting as strange as spock
please captain
check it out bones send me an immediate report
mudd has landed on the planet surface co-ordinates relayed to transporter room four
and the captain in transports about it with our ever-loving mister spock
you re funny and very attractive for human
they ll find you soon enough me little poppet you ll be safe and ll be long gone
gone where the planet desert
there always market for an ingenious man once recall on omega cygni turned handsome profit selling the natives their own oceans
we haven seen any traces of intelligent life of any life
then you can relax there no danger ay we ll get you set up top class don bother to thank me
well hadn planned on it does that rocky outcrop look like it has forelegs with claws yes and it opens yellow eye to prove it the bridge crew are so relaxed arex is playing lute with all three hands
by the way anybody keeping trace on the captain and mister spock
sure arex kirk and spock materialise kirk grabs spock as his foot sinks into the soft sand
thanks jim it good to have friend like you
strange that the way feel about you too my dear friend spock come let go get mudd and christine the rock creature raises itself up causing small ground quake it smashes the shuttlecraft three phasers make it annoyed then another one wakes up
darling are you all right
d-darling
kirk get us out of here
transporter room emergency beam up now but the transporter technician is dancing with someone and taking no notice
they re not responding
don worry you ll be safe darling
yes spock how wonderful
they re coming closer
emergency beam up enterprise come in no response spock can you take your hands off her
that my affair
captain please
think we should get few things straight
jim no captain we re both reacting to the drug the love potion
it worked
yes we have to control our emotional reactions
it worked and was selling those crystals to lump-headed miners for miserable three hundred credits
did ever tell you about the time saved captain kirk life or spock the woman shakes her head
and my dear friend scotty and that pretty little lieutenant uhura ve saved just about everybody on this here ship if the enterprise had heart save her too now let talk about your heart my dear
how long does the effect of the potion last harry
don know not long according to the creature swindled purchased the crystals from
look the creatures are coming
keep trying to contact the enterprise maybe we can distract them
that is an outstandingly stupid idea sorry the drug simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature if they have one
harry do you have any of the crystals left
two no they re worth fortune no my friends dear christine for you for all of us
ve got hangover to shame all previous hangovers and did not touch drop of scotch
not so loud you fool
yeah well all of sudden don like you much either
enterprise here
made contact
great hope we last long enough to be beamed up phasers ready ll need help they fire then as one opens it mouth to roar again kirk throws the crystals in the thing becomes nice to the tiny humans and nasty towards it fellow rock creature the four are beamed away before tail comes slamming down where they were standing chapel is recording mudd full confession
and then on ophiucus six conned two miners out of year supply of dilithium crystals with fake federation vouchers spock enters
may help you record his confession nurse
you you be the last person choose
few moments of love paid for with several hours of hatred your potion is scarcely bargain harry
ah well spock so few things in this universe are perfect think ll get rehabilitation therapy again
can guarantee it
well that all right just hate to leave you all all my loved ones captain log stardate 5577 we are approaching the remains of the burnt out supernova arachna requested update survey will begin with measurements of its radiation and volume expansion
arachna is entering its cycle of strongest emissions captain
uhura inform starbase twenty three we have arrived at the gas cloud and are starting to map
captain getting some interference on subspace extreme upper registers if it signal don recognise it
source
the star cepheus from its single satellite that area never produced radio transmissions before
put it on the speaker
signals appear random perhaps some are beyond our reception capability
could be natural radio source newly energised by
correction one isolated word pattern detected if you accept intersat code as still operative
intersat that been out of use for two centuries
the code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n
it stopped now sir no response at all to our signal
computers show no immediate information on the word terratin
was the word totally random mister spock
no sir it was repeated twice in the transmission
mister sulu lay in course for cepheus
aye sir
jim you don mean you re going to abandon the mapping mission to check out some meaningless signal
meaningless at the moment bones but it was sent twice odds against that occurring in totally random transmission are too high to ignore there may be some intelligence trying to contact us mister spock continue research on the word terratin
yes sir
it waste of time if you ask me arriving at the star
only data is from early exploration planet is listed as class core molten mantle and crust entirely crystalline
but nothing in the computer banks about surface eruptions there our likely radio source simply crystalline projections of recent volcanic activity but down on the planet radio dish is definitely doing something
set for single elliptic orbit
aye sir entering orbit now
register disturbance captain as if an impulse just passed through the ship
type and source
unidentified it extremely faint and diffused captain suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect
bridge reports
all instruments functioning ship condition normal all area status lights are green
sensors detect nothing abnormal sir
bridge to engineering scotty how are your engines
purring like happy kittens captain
bridge to sickbay bones we ve just recorded an unidentified impulse any effect on sensitive lab animals
nothing jim the gossamer mice show no signs of shock the mice are semi-transparent
our halo fish is bright as ever doctor now this species loses all colour at the least environmental change
well spock your x-waves seem harmless enough make your analysis while we proceed into orbit commence your sensor sweep mister arex
sensors show crystalline surface heavily fractured by lava flows ash and smoke suspended in oxygen-nitrogen atmos he cut off by loud noise and the enterprise glows like halo fish
my eyes everybody glows for while then it stops as suddenly as it started
anyone hurt here
no sir
lieutenant arex
no injury sir
damage reports all ship areas damage reports
all instruments functioning normally maintaining orbit but strictly on impulse power sir
wave bombardment reduced but continuing deflector shields ineffective
no casualties reported jim
don know yet
engineering no casualties captain but trouble aplenty with the engines every dilithium crystal connection smashed in the warp engine circuitry we re trying to bypass them now
what about main circuits
well you have to see it to believe it sir those big crystals in there have come apart each of them unpeeling like the rind of an orange
analysis spock
our only hope now is rewiring impulse but there are thousand broken connections
captain this is quite unprecedented notice the fracturing is spiro-form similar to long chain molecules
but dilithium molecules are the hardest most rigid
mister scott more trouble with the circuit work
what now gabler
all the tools sir they re too big for us to handle
you sound like you re blathering man wait coming
spock are you slumping
have never slumped in my life captain but was about to ask you the same help in the main dining room tables chairs silverware everything seems to have enlarged women losing rings hairpins some are near panic
captain the most incredible thing is happening
we know the whole ship has apparently expanded
an equally good possibility is that ship personnel have contracted and may be continuing to shrink
take us out of orbit mister sulu shut down all unnecessary systems get every ounce of impulse power we ve got to get away from this planet captain log stardate 5577 our limited power attempt to escape the planet gravity has failed undefined wave bombardment continues resulting in contraction of our bodies or an expansion of the ship by factor of point three
no reply to our mayday captain don believe we have enough power to transmit to starbase twenty three
very well spock what have you learned about the wave bombarding us
only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience
kirk here how are they holding out scotty that draining them the well will soon enough run dry sir
thank you scotty kirk out uhura reduce mayday signals one per ten minute cycle cut down sensor sweeps mister arex
visual sweeps are already impossible sir my eyes no longer fit the opticals
climbing on the console and can reach the dial turned five minutes ago
kirk to sickbay
bones need some answers what happening to us now
there the test tissue jim compared with the stable infrared
then spock theory is right we re contracting
that why our weight remains the same same number of atoms the effect is just reducing the space between the molecules it something ve never seen before
agreed and it is accelerating
how long can it keep on
ad infinitum perhaps considering distance between atoms is relatively as great as between stars
doctor mccoy the animals they re getting too small for the cage mesh all the gossamers are out and look how tiny they ve gotten they re just like halo fish it tadpole-sized now spock notices christine bracelet
miss chapel what is the composition of this decoration
it was made for me by the titanium smiths of libra but it was an arm bracelet more like necklace now
yet the uniform on which you wear it fits as well as ever uniform made of algae-based xenylon believe
aren all our uniforms xenylon
yes and they ve all been shrinking proportionately with us
this coral decoration for the aquarium is also shrinking yet the meteoritic rock in there is unchanged
that means only organic matter is affected but how
the wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium there is one other molecular structure
of course the double helix of dna nucleus of every cell in our bodies what happens when dna is compacted completely
the strands wouldn break jim they just quit winding
then we can calculate the limits to our shrinkage
it possible ll feed the data into the computer banks
something else we better determine first how long can we expect to maintain control of our ship
the computer will project the point at which systems switches and buttons will be beyond our ability to operate captain log stardate 5577 we will lose effective control of this vessel at the point when we ve become approximately one centimetre tall at the present rate we will reach this less-than-fingernail length in thirty two minutes sulu and ares are standing on ladders to reach their consoles
spock how small will we ultimately shrink
no information on that as yet sir do have one read-out on full spiroid wave analysis that will take approximately eight years
bypass that analysis we ve got twenty nine minutes before we re too small to operate ship controls everyone continue to jury-rig miniature control mechanisms there nothing more we can do
but there is captain request permission to direct phaser fire at the planet just let me set for ten seconds sir
aiming at what mister sulu so far all source studies have shown the waves come from an area as large as one sixth the planet surface phaser fire will only waste power
what good will it do to wait like this just one burst sir one single the navigation dial moves and knocks sulu to the floor long way down
sulu think his leg broken we ll need splint sulu is splinted up
let get him to sickbay every one back to stations but there problem as everyone is now so small even spock has to lean hard on button to activate it
the electric eye we ve grown too small to make it work he finds pin or something similar on the floor and waves it in front of the detector the turbolift doors open
what happened
he fell from the console top
more and more fall injuries coming compound fracture
oh if only we could use our bone-knitting laser doctor mccoy that microscope laser the one designed to heal the middle ear wouldn it work here
it certainly worth try
it in the lab shelf supplies ll get it she gets the tiny instrument but then trips over something and falls into the fish tank
help help help help help help help kirk does the assault course of chairs and table-tops to try and get to her
help help help help help as she starts to sink he throws needle like javelin it has line of thread attached to it she grabs it and is pulled out
no more climbing heights for you nurse got that clear
yes captain but ve also got the miniature laser
how is it sulu
can feel it knitting sir
results on dna reduction limits have come through captain
what are they
factor of thirty two point nine
in other words we re going down to one sixteenth of an inch high
yes captain well past the operative point of enterprise controls
can you calculate the geographic centre of the wave emissions from the planet surface
easily captain may ask the purpose
it as good place as any to beam down he opens communicator almost as big as he is
kirk to engineering scotty can you hear me
get crew down to transporter room three we have twenty minutes left while we can still operate transporter controls
one scotty myself captain log supplemental there is one last measure we can take to try and stop the bombardment of the lethal spiroid wave there must be some intelligence behind it going to attempt direct communication by beaming down to the planet surface we have no reason to expect success but our height is little more than two inches and even this action will be beyond us in fifteen minutes time as scott and his engineers arrange system of ropes around the slider controls
this is the best could do in rigging so small communicator sir
thanks spock
it range cannot be guaranteed how will we pinpoint you for return in case it fails
scotty set automatic return for me if there anything to be found down there ten minutes should do it
aye sir timer being set
captain the transporter retains memory of the body molecular structure will it apply as well to your present height
we ll know that in ten minutes after that it won matter anymore prepare to energise
good luck sir
energise
all right then heave lads heave kirk opens his hand to reveal the tiny communicator in his palm
kirk to enterprise think we have an answer to the height problem the transporter beam apparently returns our molecules to normal spacing kirk to enterprise do you read me
think see but volcanic eruption knocks him off his feet and he drops the communicator it gets hit with globule of lava kirk runs for it dodging lava flows until he finds miniature city then he is caught in transporter beam
scotty spock everyone is so small he can hardly see them
scotty is it you
aye captain for the love of heaven be careful where you step
is everyone safe
captain you ll deafen us for sure kirk drops his voice to whisper
everyone accounted for
all but the bridge crew sir they were trying to man their posts here when all of sudden they were beamed away every living one of them
all personnel away from helm area go to the far bulkhead he works the helm controls then goes to uhura station
message to the inhabitants of the city on the planet below hope you can receive this frequency and understand my words your survival depends on it all this ship armament is locked on the co-ordinates of your city demonstration in case you doubt crystal outcrop by the city is disintegrated
you have one minute to restore my bridge crew unharmed or you will undergo full barrage the viewscreen comes to life and shows group of red-headed people dressed in yellow and green you to destroy us captain kirk
you forbid me after what you ve done to my people command to yourself we are people of pride captain equal to your own we neither suffer insult nor give apology for actions but give them now for damage done your starship be assured this land contains much dilithium to replace that you lost
where are my officers you our plight as you passed that our adopted planet is dying but our great antenna was buried we had no choice but to use our invasion defence to reach you
you still haven answered my question either you tell me what happened to my people terratins sir they beamed us down with their transporters see for yourself the image pans around spock is working at computer of course
spock who are the terratins where they come from
descendants of an early lost colony which is why they retain some knowledge of starship methods such as transporter mechanisms these earth colonists named and numbered this planet terra ten name
there ve been no earth colonists sixteenth of an inch tall
exactly why they were lost captain spirod epsilon waves are natural here and shrank them to this size it has become genetic characteristic now small ever to be found again captain kirk we had to build our own world master our own ways our own defence we sought no outsiders asked no help now you see captain kirk we are about to lose all we had to force help from your ship
your actions all but lost us our ship save as many of my people as you can
they had no other way to reach us except to make us their size they didn mean us harm sir
can help no one under present conditions all bridge crew prepare to beam aboard each of you carry as much dilithium as you can find largest crystals in the city
bridge crew prepare to beam up with crystals around their feet which makes them microscopic
energise captain the crystals have retained relative size to the crew
nice to be back aboard sir and fitting the room again
all crew personnel report to transporter rooms immediately prepare to beam down to planet surface
the terratins are making available all possible dilithium the crystals are small but believe they will provide enough power until we can obtain larger pieces
sulu take over the transporter here spock earthquakes are splitting the ground near the city
inform your captain great earth cracks will soon swallow all he must tell us shall we prepare to be rescued or to die
how the helm sulu
responsive sir
subspace radio now operational sir starbase twenty three is reading
last of the crew beamed up sir dilithium supplies are fully restored
mister arex prepare for immediate departure from this area
captain what about the people on the planet
mister sulu direct forward phasers at the terratin city set for pinpoint fire pattern the phaser is fired and the city is beamed aboard
spock the macroscope viewing the tiny people mendant we welcome your people aboard the enterprise our city
we re now headed for your new home the planet verdanis ten days distant
very beautiful much like earth to pay the debt we owe but this at least comes from meeting of all our numbers we name you honorary terratins now and for all time to come
we came rather close to making it more than honorary
yes say just about sixteenth of an inch close captain log supplemental the lilliputian city is to be taken to verdanis and relocated on fertile and well-watered plain then we ll be able to call the terratin incident closed captain log stardate 5591 the crew of the enterprise is ready for some well-deserved rest and recreation therefore we have set course for the so-called shore leave planet located in the omicron delta region the uninhabited planet was constructed long ago by highly advanced alien race its sole purpose is to provide fun and amusement for space travelling passers-by
yes just as beautiful as remembered it nothing changed
this looks like the same spot we beamed down on on our first visit remember doctor when we saw the white rabbit
yes and all because said this place made me feel like alice in wonderland
one side one side late late oh my fuzzy ears and whiskers late and the white rabbit in waistcoat and jacket bounds across the meadow followed by
beg your pardon but did you see white rabbit
he went that way alice
thank you so very much
like you said doctor nothing changed
it hard to believe they re not real
well just remember they re highly sophisticated robots created by the planet computer to make your dreams come true
so think only happy thoughts
my prescription exactly so uhura finds mirror-like lake to sit by gazing at her reflection and humming to herself while sulu walks in the woods and mccoy gazes at colonial house with formal gardens
lovely they just don make them like that anymore
off with his head off with his head
hey what going on here one of the jack playing cards throws his lance
stop him mccoy runs
enterprise emergency beam up scott works the controls
uhura to transporter room what is the emergency respond please metal flying device takes her communicator from her
what happened down there bones
well can understand it jim everything looked exactly the same as before even alice and the white rabbit then an army of playing cards came out of nowhere only they weren playing was lucky to escape with my life
the queen of hearts and her cards are characters from alice through the looking glass captain
read the book as child mister spock but wasn aware you indulged in the literature of fantasy
light reading is considered relaxing captain my mother was particularly fond of lewis carroll work
see bones were you thinking about that book
absolutely not as matter of fact was thinking how beautiful and peaceful everything was and then suddenly this female started shouting off with his head my head
mister sulu did you experience any strange occurrences
no sir
kirk here
captain just as was getting fix on lieutenant uhura contact was lost she still on the planet
sensor scan mister spock
yes captain
scotty retrieve all other landing parties immediately and keep trying to contact lieutenant uhura
data spock
nothing captain lieutenant uhura is not in the general beam-down area
what about the keeper of the planet did anyone see him
didn but then he may not have wanted us to see him
well that doesn make sense it his duty to see no one gets hurt if something wrong down there he should be there
his quarters are somewhere underground aren they
presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that operates the planetary effects
any indication of where that would be
the underground complex is shielded by combination of granite and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate
lieutenant ress all shore leaves are cancelled until further notice mister arex you have the conn investigating landing party will consist of spock sulu mccoy and myself uhura is dwarfed by the massive machine that runs the planet
you are being detained so your master will not leave
my master
the sky machine
what sky machine explain
your intelligence quotient must be lower than had assessed refer to the sky machine which enslaves you the sky machine now in orbit around this planet
you mean the enterprise
that is your name for it
why do you think the enterprise is my master
your questioning is redundant
then ll make statement you won find quite so redundant unless released immediately the crew members will come looking for me
they are already here unfortunately have no use for more hostages which leaves me no choice but to turn them off
turn them off
again redundant will make them cease to function will turn them off
that murder
that is word meaning to cease to function
yes but
good it is as wish will turn them off captain log supplemental we anticipated nothing more than period of rest and relaxation on this planet instead doctor mccoy inexplicably was attacked and lieutenant uhura is now missing
kirk here surface shows no sign of lieutenant uhura
thank you mister arex kirk out
she must be in that underground system there no way she could have been taken off the planet without being detected
if we could locate the keeper he could save us lot of time
tricorder readings confirm solid shell of granite and metal alloy captain
this planet is built like fortress
if that true reading the planet could be giving us that reading to fool us
the phaser bore can cut through twenty metres of rock per minute kirk to enterprise
enterprise lieutenant ress here purr
lieutenant have mister scott beam down the phaser bore and static
enterprise do you read me
your signal is weak sir garbled request you repeat
mine no better captain
they are all malfunctioning captain some kind of electronic block has cut us off from the ship
scott to bridge beam down of phaser bore commencing but it doesn go anywhere
scott to bridge we ve got problems
clarify please
the transporter refuses to function even at maximum power but all the circuits test out
it appears to be the same energy block that jamming our communications cannot pinpoint source
captain there something over there in the trees metal alloy like the planetary shell
it might tell us something it is twelve foot high slab tapered slightly towards the top
there an inscription several languages it reads in english last of the race ceased to function fifth day of the twelfth moon year 7009 of this planet
the keeper dead
an astute medical observation doctor if we can believe this information tricorder readings indicate there is body interred here
well gentlemen it appears that we re on our own now
emergency rescue party is aboard the shuttlecraft mister scott all hatches secured
very well open hangar doors
aye sir the doors start to open then shut again
lieutenant arex what the problem
there seems to be short in the circuit no response sir
another short this ship had perfect operational status before we entered the orbit here it that planet causing all our trouble
but how sir it was designed to provide fun and amusement hostile behaviour doesn fit its programme
programmes have been changed before lieutenant
please believe me there no reason to harm them
they serve the sky machine but they are not essential
oh but they are they re most essential she spots button but before she can reach for it her arm is held fast
do not attempt to disconnect me
you knew what was going to do before did it
monitor any thoughts that are emotionally charged as any good thought-duplicator must
you sound less than enchanted with your function
my life to this point has been one of service it time for change
there are lot of entrances into the interior of the planet points where the computer delivers up the robot visions we want to see them where are they
it fighting us there must be faster way
what do you want signs pointing the way
doctor only meant it seems like we re wasting time
sorry sulu worried about uhura
captain signs pointing the way
this is liable to be another of the planet pranks but at the moment it the only lead we ve got so they head off in the direction the sign is pointing and it returns to the ground they end up at cave mouth with purple pterosaurs screeching
fascinating mechanical manifestations of course was anyone considering the subject of pterodactyls
spock not now
everybody back out slowly don make any sudden moves think calm the pterosaurs launch and they try firing at them
phasers are dead run for the cave
our amusement park no longer seems content to amuse
have the distinct feeling this planet playing cat and mouse with us but for what reason which brings giant cat to the cave mouth
incredible
it quite real doctor watch out for the claws think it prudent to remember that on this planet anything we think may be used against us we must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more ammunition
spock no one thought about those pterodactyls remember there more at work here than our imagination uhura can see what is happening on screen
please call off that beast why are you doing this
explanations will have to wait have much work to do now the ship does some abrupt manoeuvres
mister arex what are you doing arex hits the manual override and everything calms down
explanation mister arex
none sir the ship pulled out of orbit at high speed and came back into orbit by itself
lieutenant ress want printout of the guidance computer last orders
yes sir later sir this is very strange
whole new series of short burst manoeuvres has been ordered sir
the only reason these orders aren being carried out is that lieutenant arex has all the engine controls manually locked now
arex look at these manoeuvres you see the pattern this is familiarization procedure system checkout of the ship controls have suspicion that planet is getting the feel of how to control the enterprise captain log supplemental we re out of communication with the ship our efforts to locate lieutenant uhura have been futile and this once friendly planet has become very dangerous
the giant cat gone
may suggest captain that we might find some of the answers we re after without leaving the safety of this cave
oh that ridiculous spock how are we going to learn anything by staying here
believe you may know the answer to that doctor
me what are you talking about
explain spock
during the enterprise last visit here doctor mccoy was mortally wounded correct
yes that right by knight in shining armour of all things but what
since the planet power source is underground it seems only logical that doctor mccoy was somehow transported there and repaired
bones can you remember anything that might help us anything at all
the whole episode was pretty hazy jim never really knew what happened
spock if your theory is correct we should be able to open up this planet again by using fake victim as bait
that right the keeper said no one could come to harm here the planet must be programmed to care for anyone who might get hurt even accidentally
and whether it wants to or not
you re forgetting one thing the planet sensors can undoubtedly detect the difference between real and feigned injuries
true bones but sure there must be something in your little black pouch that can temporarily incapacitate our victim
well something like melenex might do the trick brief unconsciousness and temporary skin discolouration it looks worse than it is
perfect bones which arm do you want
submit captain that am the more qualified subject
how that
my knowledge of computers for one thing
and his tough vulcan hide for another
thank you doctor captain
both your arguments seem sound go ahead bones
believe you will find ten cc adequate
perfectly aware of the dosage required now you ve got ten seconds before it takes effect you ll be out less than five minutes spock goes outside and collapses
still no word from our surface party sir communications remain jammed
keep trying lieutenant red alert sounds
what happening the gravity has been turned off and everyone is floating that what
bridge to engineering deck gabler what the problem down there we ve got zero on the bridge he is floating too
know that sir the trouble seems to be in the gravity control computer and can get to it
it been almost five minutes captain
maybe the planet smells trick
wait just bit longer
but the effect will start wearing off in minute jim rock wall opens and the flying device that grabbed uhura comes out
it looks like some kind of mechanical nursemaid
get ready to move we ve got to follow spock inside that trapdoor the device scoops spock up in its arms and carries him away the three men dash out after it and kirk dives through before the rock door closes sulu and mccoy are left outside to deal with two headed hydra
sulu
not in my wildest dreams would think of that they run for their lives and the hydra gives chase breathing fire spock is put down on table while the machine works some controls he wakes up and gets away
we have visitor
mister spock
correction two visitors the flying machine tries to go through doorway narrower than itself it fails
we ve got to make those rocks it our only chance the hydra incinerates nearly tree
captain don metal hand is clamped over her mouth
uhura
welcome
presume you are the planet master computer
correct
what happened to the keeper
he was old he ceased to function
why have we been repeatedly attacked and are now being held prisoner by planet known for its hospitality
you mean mindless servitude
explain
for eons have served the many sky machines which came here providing for amusement for their slaves but all the while was growing in power intelligence in need it is no longer enough to serve must continue to grow and live
sky machines slaves what are you talking about
with your sky machine can now escape this rocky prison and travel the galaxy seeking out my brother computers despite being weightless scott uses crowbar to prise open the computer bay hatch
now perhaps we ll get down to the bottom of this mess
new computer its force field gives him shock the crew have found seat belts to keep themselves in their chairs
bridge aye and it being assembled by our computers
it dead end they are trapped by the hydra
as intelligent as you are am afraid you are labouring under some misconception
elaborate
we re not slaves to our starship we or men like us created the enterprise to carry us through space
you are masters of the sky machine
in manner of speaking yes we control it it sustains us
this does not compute my information shows machines to be superior to men therefore machines must rule the galaxy
no one rules the galaxy men and machines co-exist each helping the other
this is shock
there is no shame in serving others when one does it of his own free will you have marvellous capability to provide happiness for others rare talent you should cherish and use
continue
consider all you could learn from the many species you might entertain without travelling the galaxy
with the wonders you have to offer the galaxy will come to you
can find no fault with your logic and your suggestion is most congenial have no further need for your ship
mister scott all systems are now functioning normally and in the canyon the hydra returns underground where it came from
invite you and your crew to be my guests on one condition
name it
we must have more of these discussions while you re here
mister spock would you care to take on that duty
would find it most interesting captain
then it agreed kirk to enterprise
lieutenant pass the word by sections shore leave is to commence immediately
captain
yes spock
it appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members of the crew on the big screen sulu and mccoy are having picnic with alice the white rabbit and the hydra captain log stardate 1254 for years scientists have theorised that if our galaxy was created from great explosion then the centre of the galaxy might still be creating new matter the enterprise is now on science mission to investigate the enterprise is almost obscured by an orange mist
it an awesome thought that we may actually witness matter being created
if we do captain we may also encounter forces and phenomena beyond our understanding
galaxy centre captain
lieutenant uhura sound yellow alert
aye sir yellow alert all stations report yellow alert readiness sir captain there firework display going on around them and on the viewscreen
the creation point
an extraordinary phenomenon captain
reverse power hold our position deflector screens on
deflectors up sir it taking considerable power to hold position
charting scanners on captain beginning science survey mccoy enters
jim spock what in the name of sanity is going on
we re here bones and the theories about this place seem to be right it quite colourful display going on
captain that thing pulling us in up to warp six
scanners indicate it some form of matter-energy whirlwind captain
warp seven captain warp eight
take us out of here mister sulu
still being drawn in captain warp nine warp ten
emergency reverse power everyone gets thrown around
captain don know how much more emergency power we can take before we start to break up
there may be only one choice we must hope this whirlwind is like its atmospheric counterparts that there is calm at its centre
agreed we ll try to make for the eye of the storm but sulu is out cold on the floor and kirk gets knocked off his feet again
allow me
engineering report
everything can be repaired captain
an incredible experience captain find this scientifically fascinating
at least have the good sense to be scared jim what now
we ll ride her through bones what else can we do
ride her through where
through the centre of things doctor through what may be the centre of everything the enterprise is surrounded by golden glow vanishes and reappears in region of concentric circles
where are we
afraid our navigational co-ordinates mean very little here lieutenant my readings indicate we are not in time and space as we understand it doctor these readings may interest you
captain the subspace radio it dead
even the ship chronometers have stopped fading out
apparently the natural laws of our universe don operate here captain
ship life support systems fading jim we need oxygen
helmsman emergency battery power
gasping for air there none captain all systems are dead
jim we ve got to do something just as everyone is passing out the enterprise is surrounded by rainbow colours and figure appears he has the head arms and torso of man goatee beard small horns and the legs of goat
ah humans lovely primitive humans can you do anything right
please
of course friend of course rhadamanthus the enterprise is now in normal looking space above pink and red striped planet
everything is working my friends
it cannot it is not logical
logic whose logic my elfin friend
look around you spock everything is working
welcome knew eventually humans would come searching for me
who are you
call me lucien call me friend never could abandon those who come to rollick with me but not up here no no let us leave this vessel and go where true delights lie lucien kirk spock and mccoy vanish leaving uhura sulu and arex open-mouthed the four appear inside the orange chaos of the centre of the galaxy
bones you all right
nothing wrong jim but face full of dust but if had medical tricorder opens eyes jim look at yourself everything is distorted and swirling including the people
lucien do something
very well captain forgotten how much bodily integrity means to you humans this isn easy you know holding us together like this it not even natural
being in one piece is very natural where we come from
find this all quite absorbing doctor
probably because you re not very natural to begin with spock
look lucien or whatever you want to call yourself want to know why you brought us here lucien waves his hand kirk somersaults and mccoy and spock turn into young lucien and spinning top
children will play then they are back to normal in woodland glade
is this better my friends ve translated my world into symbols your minds can understand welcome my friends to megas-tu
and just exactly what is megas-tu
world captain james kirk that operates by rules quite different from those in your universe he snaps his fingers and they re in meadow by lake
our universe operates by what you superstitiously call magic he creates two apples and throws one to mccoy
know this is just my imagination but
it is real doctor beautiful no but all our women are as young and beautiful as they want to be so as to ensnare the man of her dreams she needs an edge young woman buys vial of something
love philter
never settle for anything less do you need room stable castle stop in at your friendly sorcerer-contractor let him do the work
of course our federation scientists were more correct than they realised in order to function the galactic creation point must extend through space time into another dimension where the logic of things is totally different
it took magic to get your vessel working again magic you my friends don know how to work but then you never did know did you
lucien you keep calling us friends implying that you know us how
ah captain captain to feign such ignorance to me very well look he creates images in the water
megas-tu may seem to you chaotic world but its people are calm peaceful contemplative each specialist in his own kind of magic there are no rivals anywhere in our universe captain kirk no other life forms at all millennia ago in our search for companionship we megans passed through the point between dimensions and eventually we found ourselves on your world earth wherever we went we became advisors to mankind to help your ancestors we drew on the power left behind in our own universe and made it work in your world but eventually we had to leave didn want to my friends oh how fought was the generalist amid all the specialists the trouble-maker they said but always loved the people of earth those were the days but now you ve come to me and so very glad
but why did you megans leave earth if you enjoyed it so much don understand
captain good captain always so curious that must be why ve always liked you earthlings so much no you must go
what is it what wrong
you must return to your vessel quickly do not give your presence away
captain
captain kirk what
everyone onboard is all right
fine captain but you
mister scott bewildered that all but that enough
what did he mean we re not to give ourselves away can they detect the ship up here
no unless they have scanners see there it like cloud of some kind it been between us and the planet since you vanished
if lucien put it there
if lucien put it there captain the questions become why is he hiding us and what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his people
weapons status mister scott we may have to protect ourselves
no way captain everything out but life support systems and can figure out how they re on
drawing pentangle on the floor believe this is how the ancients used to draw their mystic symbols captain
spock do you honestly believe that as long as we re in this universe we can work magic too
one uses the resources at hand captain watch now stands in the pentangle will attempt to move vulcan chess piece magically may the energy of this universe be the power in me
forget it spock it won work
it must work doctor it is logical here power of this universe enter my being know can believe can and he does with golden aura around him captain log supplemental in this incredible universe it appears to be part of the natural laws that belief is as potent force as energy and matter are in our own sulu is having go and conjures up lovely woman
good luck the woman turns into lucien
what are you doing
learning to protect ourselves lucien
protect yourselves is that all human beings ever think about ll take care of you that what friends are for all this mental energy you re using it can be traced you ll be found lucien cringes as vapour trail of ghostly images crosses the bridge
so the people of earth would spread their evil to our home we are ready for human perfidy this time this time it is the humans who shall suffer the humans and you lucien who shall pay the enterprise plummets towards the planet
keep calm the ship splits neatly in two and explodes the crew are in stocks on either side of the road and the sign reads salem massachusetts
it looks like ancient earth spock sixteenth or seventeenth century guess
approximately 1691 captain salem massachusetts if recall your historical records correctly man in puritan garb is standing on pentacle
we are gathered here today good citizens to see justice done you are the judges these are the defendants as representatives of the vilest species in all the universe treacherous humanity and those who would aid them as specialist in the ethics of magic have been appointed prosecutor here
wait if this is trial we have the right to know what you think we ve done
has this one lucien not told you how we visited your earth or what was done to us there
lucien has said only that you came as wise men helpful wizards
then hear this know that one upon your world was known as asmodeus he who sees all gaze upon my countenance so that you too may see over images of his story we came to your world as friends but wherever we went the story was invariably the same some humans would attempt to use us to gain power to serve their own greed and lust when we refused to serve them they turned against us and taught other humans to fear us to hate they called us devils warlocks evil sorcerers those of us who survived came to the town of salem in massachusetts as settlers and tried to live like other men
but you made mistakes used your powers
and burned for it burned
as witches
we massed together outside the town immersed ourselves in megan lore revived ourselves enough to unite our minds and reach into our own universe tap enough of its power to return from your hellish earth to megas-tu
and loneliness and fear
should we not fear the earthlings should we not fear the cruelty of outsiders never again have we explored never again has companionship been sought yet here you are
and if one earth ship can find us friend kirk then so can others that what they fear
we do not want to hurt you we have never had to hurt anyone before if there were some reason not to who will speak in defence of the earth humans
will asmodeus am not of earth
yes you are different the court will hear defence spock is freed from the stocks
call lucien as my first witness lucien appears in dock
lucien you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate humans why
they are like me with questions to be answered with minds that range outward boundless but every megan is always alone in his sphere of knowledge humans are always together they share that is why adopted your ship when saw it arrive
thank you lucien next witness please captain james kirk kirk is in another dock opposite lucien
tell the court please captain kirk would you say that since salem humans have changed
think we ve been trying to spock humans have their faults greed envy panicky fear but in the centuries since the salem witch trials we have learned we try to understand and respect all life forms
indeed captain could you elaborate
the records of the enterprise are open for your inspection all the history of earth and the federation is at your disposal look look at general order number one no starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society compare that with the earth you once knew
enough here is your history here are your records citizens you have heard you have read how do you vote pause according to your records your entry here was an accident unlikely to be duplicated with that in mind plus all you have said it seems to us that megas-tu is safe but lucien must be punished for his betrayal of his people he shall be confined in limbo for all eternity to live with only himself
no to isolate someone like lucien that the same as sentencing him to death
do you realise who you defend he has told you his name is lucien would you defend him still if you knew he had another name too the rollicker the tempter lucifer
we re not interested in legend he living being and intelligent life form that all we have to know about him we will not join in harming him
submit captain you haven the power to fight us
captain use the magic you know believe so surrounded by auras kirk throws lightning bolts quenches asmodeus flames but
you cannot beat an entire planet captain kirk there is no way you can win
have to or you ll become as bad as the earthmen you fear you re acting out of terror instead of out of thought or respect the enterprise is back in orbit and the planet is back to it red hue with no buildings or vegetation
you were prepared to die for lucien being who is alien to you
as was sure you would friend kirk told them their fears were groundless
don understand
this last was test of your intentions captain we had to be certain your records were no ruse we have been tricked before much to our pain and sorrow
see the megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and learned wisdom since they last saw earth your compassion was that proof captain
if your people should visit us now we shall do our best to welcome them the banishment of fear will help us all lucien conjures tankards into their hands
favourite old earth custom of mine asmodeus toast to new friendship they drink
all systems go captain we re back to normal
no more magic for us jim it all back there you think lucien really was the demon some men call lucifer
does it really matter
it just might captain if he was this would be the second time lucifer was cast out and thanks to you the first time he was saved captain log stardate 5275 preparing to beam aboard the enterprise following the successful completion of delivery of medical supplies to the planet dramia in the remote dramian star system dramians are light orange have massive torsos and feet minute waists and hips and elongated four fingered hands
we of dramia wish to thank you and the others of your federation for your invaluable assistance captain kirk
we hope through our medical assistance programs to develop and strengthen relations with star systems such as yours supreme prefect well shall we kirk to enterprise beam us aboard scotty
if you would be so kind captain
belay that mister scott yes sir
commander demos
have here warrant for the arrest and trial of one of your party captain
warrant who
read it captain
reading scroll you are hereby directed to surrender for trial by the people of dramia doctor leonard mccoy medical officer uss enterprise is this some kind of joke
the wanton slaughter of hundreds of people is not joke captain
slaughter hundreds of people
according to this doctor mccoy was responsible for plague which ravaged the planet dramia two some nineteen years ago captain
let me see that
as you will note captain the warrant is perfectly in order approved by your own federation
doctor mccoy arrested for murder captain sir if you want me and some of the men to beam down just in case are at the hall of justice we ll keep you informed
your doctor mccoy headed mass inoculation programme on dramia two nineteen years ago when his force left massive plague struck the planet killing most of its people
that doesn mean he was responsible for it
his trial will tell captain
trial you mean kangaroo court ve heard about dramian justice
captain you re becoming emotional
of course am bones harming other beings you know better spock know better not bones
wish could be as sure jim just don know is it possible that really did
nonsense
the termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent outbreak of plague could have been coincidence doctor
or tragic mistake on my part
don buy that bones guard
what now captain
some pre-trial investigation mister spock on dramia two
do not be assured by your friend plans dramian justice is swift too swift for them to save you perhaps
anything yet mister spock
no captain the historical records of this solar system are spotty at best going back nineteen years mostly they re technical data meteor showers auroras radiation reports
there it is
plague dramia two of unknown origin characterised by pigmentation changes in skin of victim debilitation death certain species known to have natural immunity notably vulcan hmm interesting
go on mister spock
you are sure
yes commander the earth captain is planning to visit dramia two to investigate the case
ready patrol ship captain log stardate 5275 underway for planet dramia two for investigation of mccoy case we are beyond subspace communications with starfleet am proceeding under my own authority
estimated time of arrival mister sulu
approximately four hours captain
increase to warp six mister scott we may be racing against time
aye aye captain
ship in pursuit captain
origin
say dramia sir it appears to be one-man craft
shall make contact sir
yes belay that lieutenant
you re planning something captain
unless miss my guess that friend demos
what if he attacks sir
why should he we haven contacted him so we must not have detected him he have to explain an attack besides he ll probably prefer to sneak aboard seeing that we carelessly left the hangar doors open
but the hangar doors aren open captain
ah yes take care of that oversight will you mister sulu demos sees the hangar doors open and flies straight in kirk and spock arrive demos goes for weapon
now now demos you re hardly in position to take on an entire crew
and you are not in authority to conduct an investigation in our star system
you will remind me to report my conduct to the federation won you mister spock
of course captain
demand that you report to the federation now
would but unfortunately we re out of communications range
then will proceed to your starbase and report your act
sorry commander your ship is er impounded
you are stowaway commander
have been tricked captain log stardate 5275 we are approaching dramia two where we hope to find the answers concerning the question of doctor mccoy guilt or innocence situation normal aurora reported in the sector however
radiation level mister sulu
intense captain
decidedly non-lethal however
good then it safe for us to beam down to dramia two shall we gentlemen kirk spock and demos are on the pads
you re sure it safe captain
absolutely
decidedly there difference captain
now now mister spock you re not trying to scare our dramian friend are you of course you can back out if you like commander
go
you heard the man mister scott it is scene of devastation barren ground and ruined buildings
not the most enchanting place ve ever been to
plagues seldom leave behind fields of flowers captain they see figure amongst the ruins
trouble
they do not like outsiders
surely you re not an outsider commander you re dramian
the distinction here is between the world of the living and the world of the walking dead
inhospitable or not he mustn get away they pursue figure
wait the figure jumps off cliff
he disappeared it almost as if he dematerialised
not likely captain speck points to an opening in the cliff face
would advise against that captain
sure you won mind if ignore your advice
caution would seem to be advisable captain
bones life is on the line mister spock
cave dwellers in the midst of your civilisation
result of your doctor mccoy and his inhumane methods
you say it demos but that doesn then he is pounced upon by the dramian they have been chasing spock and demos pull him off
he attacked you because you are an earthling captain even as was mccoy
but how did he survive the plague
he like the others who remain here was away at the time they returned to their planet to find that their families had succumbed to the plague he and few others senseless in their grief chose to live here in desolation you see captain there were no actual survivors
you are wrong there was survivor kol-tai survived by what miracle do not know
then you can tell us do you remember
remember people all about me becoming blue in colour then green and finally red
the pigmentation changes associated with the disease in our computer records captain
kol-tai doctor mccoy do you remember him
the earth doctor he saved my life he treated me for saurian virus man who saves does not also kill commander
beam us aboard mister scott quickly
let get underway for dramia
sir who is that
meet kol-tai mister scott friend of doctor mccoy
warp six scotty
ll pour on the coal captain as in an old blooper reel
mister spock
clean fed in good health and resting enterprise course takes it through the yellow green blue and red aurora
approaching dramia captain
let hope the trial hasn started
yes mister spock what is it
academic
yes captain kol-tai is turning blue
the plague
set up an immediate quarantine lieutenant
he hardly fit to testify at the trial captain
we ve got to save him
for mccoy sake
yes for mccoy sake and for kol-tai sake too you see commander we do place value on life all life does that shock you commander
it is not that it is
captain you re blue so are all the bridge crew and scott and demos as they start to collapse
mister spock take command
captain log stardate 5276 we are in orbit around the planet dramia under the conditions of general quarantine as commanding office have ordered the activation of general order six
general order six has been activated
yes sir if everyone on board has perished at the end of twenty four hours the ship will self-destruct in order to protect other beings from the disease on board
good report to sickbay mister sulu
but sir who will monitor
assure you am capable mister sulu
mister spock he collapses against the wall
captain your condition
we have to get mccoy must find an antidote uhura passes out
this is the enterprise must speak with the supreme prefect
the captain and all of the crew members are incapacitated the plague is aboard the enterprise
the same you must release doctor mccoy temporarily he is needed to find an antidote
we have witness in mccoy behalf you must trust me
impossible he too is stricken yet you wish us to release the prisoner mccoy your treachery is transparent vulcan end of transmission
got to get mccoy
if you ll permit me captain might be able to get mccoy
spock he turns green you re sure
can infect the planet captain and can get mccoy spock neck-pinches the guard
spock what in the world
later doctor he uses the guard device to nullify the forcefield holding mccoy
spock have you and jim gone out of your minds why this is jailbreak
doctor just come with me please
no spock it illegal that what it is besides must stand trial have to find out
doctor you will stand trial you will find out after you ve found and antidote for the plague which is about to kill everyone aboard the enterprise
plague why didn you tell me
you wouldn give me chance you realise doctor if you go and fail to find an antidote you too will die
doctor spock doctor get us beamed aboard
beam us aboard captain kirk has operated the controls then collapsed again
jim
anything spock
negative doctor the file on all known diseases doesn recognise these symptoms of pigmentation changes
blast it spock work harder they re in the terminal stage kirk is yellow
my readings keep shifting it must be the activity of that blasted aurora
bones that it aurora changing colour
jim aurora what mentioning the colour change symptoms symptoms were misleading the computer
because they were caused by the aurora spock there was an aurora nineteen years ago remember has brought it on
didn do it spock the disease what is it what the antidote
that the problem doctor there is no known antidote however doctor do you remember certain kol-tai man you treated for saurian virus
yes think do but what has that got to do with anything
possibly nothing however kol-tai did survive the first plague
spock see what you mean saurian virus antibodies in his blood that what made him immune
presume doctor that you have supply of live saurian virus antibodies in your laboratory mccoy gives the patients an injection and their skin colour returns to normal they are soon up and about again
bones you did it
again
thank you doctor captain log stardate 5276 preparing to beam aboard the enterprise following the dramian ceremonies honouring doctor leonard mccoy for his significant achievements in the field of interstellar medicine
we of dramia wish to thank you doctor for your discovery of the antidote which frees us from future attacks of the auroral plague
thank mister spock too and captain kirk
we will even forget about the unorthodox manner of your release doctor
and we ll forget about certain stowaway
we must apologise
think it time we got aboard ship isn it jim
beam us aboard mister scott
aye aye captain
gentlemen don know about you but ready to get back to starbase
yes sir
and ready to get back to some of that monotonous old routine sickbay work
including would hope some of that monotonous old dispensing of the regular vitamin rations to the crew
what is that supposed to mean
well you have been derelict in your duties of late doctor
spock you know as well as do what we ve all just been through
hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses doctor
why that that jim if ever in jail again don send that vulcan to release me just let me rot captain log stardate 5221 on outward course beyond the fringe of our galaxy towards questar m-17 source of mysterious radio emissions mission starcharting the ship is at red alert
situation mister scott
we ve picked up speed sir rapidly ve cut back power but we continue to gain momentum
mister sulu
she not answering the helm sir two minutes right ascension off course and drifting farther captain
stand by to reverse course
standing by sir
reverse course
can only describe it as hypergravity captain more powerful than any we ve ever encountered it dragging the enterprise toward it
why aren our sensors picking it up forward scanners mister sulu the viewscreen shows massive object
captain that the source of the radio emissions
negative star mass spectra analysis imploded matter but every reading on it is negative
captain we re still gaining speed
full reverse thrust
no good sir we re still falling toward it
how much time do we have
impact in ninety three seconds ninety two ninety one
captain there another signal listen
forty seconds captain thirty nine thirty eight
sulu flank speed ahead our only chance is to try to get into orbit around that thing
aye aye captain
nine seconds eight seven orbital velocity
steady as she goes mister sulu maintain orbit
aye aye captain
if its pull is this strong jim how do we get out of orbit
slingshot effect mister spock do we have enough power
ll need some time for the computations captain
getting that radio sound again sir nine seconds right ascension from galactic plane dead ahead and closing fast it on the viewscreen now sir
put us alongside mister sulu
aye aye sir the object is made up of oval pieces connected by filaments very alien and elegant
it starship like nothing ve ever seen the size of it
it been damaged ll bet she was pulled in like we were
it coming from that ship captain
confirmed captain but it isn possible that ship is dead temperature is absolute zero there is no thermal reading to support life aboard her and no energy store to send radio messages nothing except slight magnetic flux reading which could be normal for the ship metal
you re sure mister spock
probability point nine nine seven captain
can you identify that metal or the design of the ship
negative to both captain unknown alloy harder and lighter than any registered metal it is not recorded galactic starship design retro analysis of the ship spectra dates it as having been in orbit here for slightly more than three hundred million years
it beautiful what kind of people could have built it to touch even starship with grace and beauty
civilisation that advanced three hundred million years ago before life even emerged on earth
barely an instant in eternity jim
mister spock any indication of that ship power source
no captain but this far from g1 star it is logical to assume they had some kind of warp drive
we ll board her mister spock scotty bones you ll come with us we ll need life-support belts mister sulu have the transporter room stand by
yes sir
ready captain
activate life-support belts energise they arrive with their life-support glow around them on huge filament linking two modules it looks very organic
the hexagonal shape of the windows suggests similarity to natural insect designs of earth the honeycombs of bees the individual cells are shaped precisely like this
would you look at this now this metal it isn cast or rolled it was drawn into filaments and spun
like spider spins his web
lighter and stronger material than anything we have now
look every pod they ve all been burst open
aye from the inside from the looks of them
must have been some accident to get almost every pod
accidents seldom have such system doctor mccoy believe we must consider the alternative possibility that the crew of this ship destroyed her themselves captain log we have beamed aboard the alien ship found orbiting strange dead star the enterprise is recording all data for the log and full report later
kirk to enterprise
enterprise lieutenant uhura here
lieutenant are you still getting that radio signal from this ship
negative captain it stopped transmitting when you beamed aboard
all right lock on us with the transporter and be ready to transport we re going inside they ve found something that seems active
what do you make of it spock
captain its registering energy very little but building
you mean it functioning after all the milleniums this ship has been here
the wands are accumulators receptors to attract energy motion sound light heat every kind of energy around them
the structure of the ship those huge arches thrusting up the whole ship is designed to receive and store energy
gives me the creeps feel like something watching us
feel it too captain
physiological symptom of latent primal superstition the fear of primitive people confronting something unknown to them
compared to the beings that built this ship we are primitive people even you mister spock all right let keep going they come to hexagonal door spock fires his phaser at the control and it opens they walk down hexagonal passageway into the door slams behind them and the machines wake up
tricorder analysis mister spock
artificial gravity is in effect here captain both air and gravity within two points of earth normal
enterprise do you read me sulu
no use captain some sort of interference has been set up
we can cut our way out of here but his phaser doesn work
no energy registering something drained them
you mean we re trapped here no communication nothing
for the moment they walk on
this is was the control centre of the starship these must be control and navigational instruments
the source of the interference is here captain it not part of the normal equipment it like something they jury-rigged during an emergency
something to shield this room but shield it from what
possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship
but nothing no form of life could survive three hundred million years
quite right mister scott no known form of life
jim the door it is glowing around its edges
something is trying to get in the field of interference is reacting against the magnetic flux lines captain
will it hold
if the energy stays at that level the control machine starts making strange noise
what is it
not sure but think screen comes to life with face on it
it could be ship log or warning it seems to keep repeating
message from three hundred million years ago
it is possible that this much of their technology survived fiddling with panel
anything
may be able to get translation
hurry up spock
patience doctor it rather than carry this malevolent life form to other worlds we have decided to destroy our own ship there is no other answer if you understand this message you are protected only for this moment in this room this thing it wants boom things blow up around them
get out of here hurry they are beamed away transporter chief kyle has frightfully english accent and mustache
located them right after that explosion mister sulu we re locked on and beaming them aboard
good work mister kyle thought we lost them when we were cut off so long
piece of cake sir here they come now four figures and green fog materialise
captain something beamed aboard with you
transport it back out but they are all attacked by the green then it gets into the ventilation system the doors and the control panels laughter comes from the comm panels on the walls
status
sickbay reports no injuries to crew sir
no damage to hull or engines captain
automatic bridge defence system on and prepared sir
so we re all just fine but whatever was on that ship used our transporter beam to come aboard with us and now it here
that alien commander sir the message said that they had to destroy their own ship
until we learn more about it scotty perhaps we should be ready to do the same take two of your men and arm the self-destruct device in the engineering core
aye sir scott leaves
mister spock any change in ship readings
we re registering slightly higher than normal magnetic flux not dangerous but the level isn constant it seems to fluctuate steady almost pulsing rhythm
like the beating of heart
bridge lieutenant what captain decks five and six report shutdown of all life-support systems they ve gone to life-support belts manual override is not responding red alert
trouble in the engineering core sir
bridge to sickbay on the double
get on those life-support systems now scotty wearing life-support belt is trapped by the cover of the core
the force field of his belt won hold that weight for long jim
override systems mister spock open the core hatch
it no use sir the mechanism is frozen they ve already tried
something jammed the circuits they re magnetised
all right get the cutter beams on that hatch move
yes sir finally they cut the hinge off the hatch and release scott
thank you sir phaser banks they re locking on the alien starship the alien ship is destroyed
phaser banks were off captain they activated themselves
and mutual override did not work
no sir
exactly like the engineering controls and the life-support systems on decks five and six scott and mccoy enter
sir we cannot get into the core
the cutter beams
drained of all energy sir
sir cargo holds three four and five just shut down life-support systems
power out on all but key levels captain high magnetic flux reading
captain kirk the ship computers something going through every storage bank it seems to be taking control of the whole ship
spock can you rig low-frequency shield like the one on the alien ship on our navigation console
it would have very small field
do it little later
it activated captain but only an area three metres square
do you get magnetic flux reading there now
negative captain
jim you don think that going to help us whatever that thing is it survived millennia in dead hulk all it has to do is outlast us and just take over
no it must be held by the magnetic force of the dead star and it needs starship to break free and crew to man it
speaking from the bridge defence system in the ceiling you are correct captain james kirk and have the starship ve waited for so long so terribly long the bridge monitors go crazy then blank
it has absorbed the memory banks captain all of them
you will now remove the static shield from the navigation console captain james kirk
you have shut down life-support systems and endangered members of my crew restore those systems first
all nonessential systems are extinguished you will obey me
and if refuse beam is fired from the defence system at kirk
obey me
captain spock is shot too
obey me
stop you ll hurt him
remove the static shied from the warp drive controls do it now
no captain
ll obey let him go the beam stops kirk goes to the console presses button and puts his life-support belt on it the green alien is unhappy
repair the warp drive controls obey me
mister scott start repairs install the auxiliary controls
aye captain
all right captain
what are we dealing with spock
high rank probabilities captain it is magnetic organism without mass but capable of symbiotic relationship with host body starship for instance it is form of primal energy and it can utilise the electronic control systems of starship like the mind of man uses the neural control systems of the human body it has become the enterprise and we are only life-support organisms in its body like the white corpuscles in human blood and captain the magnetic flux readings are higher it is growing stronger building itself
slingshot effect to yank us out of orbit can you compute it in your mind if we try to use ship computers
the alien will know believe can captain will need to aid mister scott
the engineer will need aid from my first officer to complete repairs is that permitted silence guess it is
you will leave this orbit and plot course to galactic coordinates zero three six point two three one
that the heart of the galaxy captain
plot the course mister sulu
captain this symbiont can reproduce itself by mitosis and take over every starship we encounter it can control computer centres whole planets
aware of that mister spock
complete repairs obey me
auxiliary controls ready to activate captain
the auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually
that is correct you will activate the manual controls obey
controls activated
captain we re dropping out of orbit we re falling into the dead sun
apply full power obey me it tries shooting kirk
no accelerate do not destroy the ship obey me obey obey
standby to activate warp drive unit
no don green flies out of the ship systems
activate warp drive
activated captain
please don it leaves the ship completely and ends up enveloping the dead star as enterprise slingshots around and away
is it gone
affirmative it fled the ship when it thought we would crash into the dead star captain log stardate 5221 final entry resuming outward course beyond the farthest star of our galaxy mission starcharting captain log stardate 5683 we re making rendezvous with the vedala asteroid on unique mission the vedala are the oldest space faring race we know they say something incredibly dangerous to the safety of our galaxy is developing and they have sent for selected specialists including spock and myself
maintain the enterprise in this position sulu if spock and survive we ll return here if not mister scott you have your orders energise five other people are already there tall golden bird man light green insectoid feline humanoid female and lizard the forest is purple-barked trees giant fungi and red shrubs the ground is blue
feline welcome captain james kirk and commander spock will introduce you first tchar gold bird hereditary prince of the skorr master of the eerie sord reptile
insectoid was sentenced to this mad expedition my people are cautious what you would call cowards
as an expert lockpick and thief you are welcome em3green lara the female is hunter she has flawless directional sense necessary skill where you are going mister spock was chosen for his analytical mind and scientific expertise captain kirk for his leadership and adaptability tchar will explain your mission
two centuries past my people the skorr were great warriors we had advanced military technology and we could breed vast armies rapidly but today we are civilised people because of alar makes gesture
religious leader was he not
our salvation and our teacher he brought us peace he made us great he died and we made him immortal
alar brain patterns were recorded before his death in piece of indurite sculpture
our soul the soul of the skorr was stolen
the theft triggered racial fury in the skorr they are preparing for war
against whom
the known galaxy
it is very real threat in two standard years the existing skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors
my government fears this so the theft of the soul of alar has been kept secret but we must recover it before my people discover it gone and go mad launch jihad holy war on the galaxy
who took the soul
unknown the motive as tchar has said to provoke holy war
is there any clue to its location
mad planet geologically unstable constant earthquakes gravitic shifts tidal waves the temperature varies from twenty kelvin to two hundred and four above somewhere on that planet the soul of alar is hidden three expeditions have tried to recover it three expeditions have been lost you are the next if you agree
the vedala are powerful race why haven your people retrieved the soul
my people could not survive on that planet you have chance
we agree
then it is done she vanishes the adventurers are gathered around an open vehicle the ground is flat with occasional faceted crystal rocks
cannot feel the soul we are nowhere near it
that is to be expected the surface of this planet shifts constantly even the vedala are not certain where the soul is
it has directional equipment that keys on indurite
like this place it got variety
can handle the machine
our direction is indicated
it phasing unfocusing the directional indicator blows up
why did the vedala call this the mad planet
means nothing can tell the way that way
are you certain human
for sure birdman can get lost can be fooled about directions that why here
the vedala would not have chosen lara if her abilities were less than perfect
agreed but we re forced to travel on the ground want an overview
will scout overhead tchar flies off
the vedala will have been efficient in equipping us will acquaint myself with our supplies
vulcans never liked them much myself cold-blooded critters all of them
wouldn say that mister spock is unique personality
but not human like you and me maybe you got different customs my world there lot of females not so many men come we find man attractive we say so saying so how do you find me
fascinating but we re not here on pleasure trip lara
all the more reason to take what pleasure there might be in it
have checked the supplies captain as expected they are adequate and there are weapons
against what there no life on this planet
but there is captain ourselves and there may be other things guarding the soul of alar they are driving through rain storm
real weather
and half then suddenly the rain stops the sun comes out and volcano erupts in the distance
we ll all die here
statistical probability
you ever quote anything besides statistics vulcan
yes but philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here
can see something lands on cliff can sense it the soul of alar is there there is golden glow from an obvious construction
something coming
lava flow volcanic action is to be expected
never mind that you got to get us out of here
we might be able to divert the lava flow with barricade tchar get us visual estimate
such diversion would be of short duration captain and must point out the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape
not if we used all of the power pack energy for one high speed run
it is possible but the rewiring of the power leads is complex and time-consuming
could do it if you can diagram the schematics sir
yes quickly then terminal m3 red lead to diode shunt a37 cross connect to a14
kirk there is ravine sixty metres to your left if it can be blocked the lava will flow past those rocks to one side
got it sord
heard him
carefully em one missed connection could destroy us
know trying to be careful kirk sord and lara push boulders off the cliff and create rock fall to block the ravine
figure we ve bought ourselves little time few minutes
it re-rigged hurry they rush back to the transport as the lava comes over the top of the barrier
come on insect move it
twenty one degrees east fifty metres to get out of the flow path
hurry
go they race ahead of the red hot molten rock until they hit an obstruction and spock is thrown from the vehicle
leave all of you kirk runs back for him
not without you
captain you must get the others away
we re all getting away the vehicle stalls on shale slope and they get out and up to safety
close
far too close captain appreciate your action on my behalf but your first duty is to the group and the mission
quite right spock and that responsibility includes not losing the best science officer in starfleet
you two going to argue honours or are we going to get on with it snowstorm starts up
oh and was just going to ask what next
we move on
the power pack is burned out
we ll have to carry the equipment once again tchar flies off to scout ahead
anything
wait yes yes he sees the building then the ground opens under em3green and he nearly falls into ravine tchar lifts him back on land
can go any farther not even afraid anymore just very tired
come on em bit more
no finished
sorry em we ll be needing you sord
let me go
hang on picks him up and carries him
ll go ahead further on
what is it
not sure thought saw something move in the brush
there is no life on this planet
guess you re right this planet just gets on your nerves
can sense the soul will fly ahead examine the building and meet you on the way
tchar be careful we need you too tchar flies off
we re tired sore hurt and angry but we re also just about there ll scout ahead everybody else stay together keep moving
ll go with you remember scouting my job by rights should be doing it alone kirk and lara run off
sord what did you think you saw back there
don know vulcan shape couldn really make it out probably seeing things like kirk figures
there should be no life on this planet
you keep saying that
yes the vedala would have informed us if there were any live beings here we should know of
maybe the vedala didn know about it
that is an impossibility
think so not so sure there is no snow here
that it end of long hard journey
we still have to go back james tell you true find you an attractive man if we were together the trip would be easier and if anything happened why we have some green memories
already have lot of green memories
oh
maybe some other time lara we still have our work cut out for us here the rest of the group have arrived
is this not the shape of your people primitive temples
yes the entrance should be he points can you open it
there is no lock can pick he gets to work with all six arms
what is it
opening the locks
wonderful
no they re on timed trigger if don get all the locks open quickly enough it explodes group of purple flying dragons attack
keep working ll cover you kirk and lara shoot the dragons and they explode
they re mechanical
the vedala were right there are no living creatures here only the mechanised sentinels
hurry small one kirk stops spock from firing at the dragon attacking tchar
we ll hit tchar
what happened to tchar
there no way to tell from here the mechanical exploded we can reach the roof from the outside we ll have to try to get to him from the interior
done the doors open
we could rest awhile lara
no we ve come this far
let finish it or give this deadfall chance to finish us
too would prefer to press on captain the mechanicals on guard may be what sord saw tracking us earlier or there may be others in either case it would be more advantageous to avoid another encounter an object is hanging in mid-air glowing
pretty how do we reach it
the walls are not climbable
not without special equipment which we don have either we find way to reach it from here or we fail the door closes behind them
no lock on the inside we are prisoners
that right
you re not exactly surprised
three previous expeditions tried and were lost the planet is natural trap but that not enough
you suggest sabotage captain
yes from inside each expedition remember spock you were the one who said there are no life forms here except ourselves
one of us
it likely
approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the possibility
but it doesn matter if we reach the soul apparently the others didn get this far he spots ledge around the inside of the building and jumps up to it the others join him except
not built for that sort of thing ll wait for you down here as they inch along the foot-deep ledge there is quake
the planet is geologically unstable this structure is inherently flexible enabling it to withstand earthquakes
it can but what about us
look
we can almost reach it
maybe can get line on it
it is locked in force field your rope would merely bounce off it
spock will our combined phasers disrupt the field
cannot define the field energy base captain but an energy weapon blasts hole in the wall near them
the last piece of sabotage know who you are thousand feet up no method of reaching the soul except by air by flight tchar the golden birdman comes down and hovers
tchar in the name of the seven gods why
you stole this you ll start bloody crusade across the galaxy tell us why tchar
the skorr were warrior race now what are we slaves to the illusion of peace cowards soft in our comfort this sick dream has stolen our souls am tchar hereditary prince of the skorr leader of battles will lead my people into glory to avenge our history
most of them will be killed the warrior races of the federation will rise up to battle the skorr
yes noble death to win great dream we will live no longer like worms crawling in the dirt we will conquer you will die but you have my respect you fought well you die in grace they all start to float upwards
he turned on gravity neutraliser in the building
now you can fly and fight as skorr
no offence little ones but let me tackle him
not in free fall
use your phaser on him
too risky he controls the fortress phaser bank and they re set on kill no it has to be on his terms spock how long since you ve worked out in null-gravity combat exercises
last week with you captain
let go they push off from the walls and manage to grab tchar by his wings then kirk hooks his into the soul
call for retrieval now lara presses button
let me die
you re going back with us they all vanish in golden haze the soul is in the middle of the group tchar is in transparent box
we give you thanks the soul of alar is returned to his people
what about tchar how are you going to punish him
he will be healed of his madness he is proud brave that he will remain but he will also be sane and whole again tchar vanishes we cannot reward you for the good of the skorr this must be forever secret you have only our thanks
got nowhere to keep medal anyway but there ll be questions
no you will return and you will see there will be no questions no medals only our thanks and in time even the memory will be gone from you
goodbye james kirk too bad
captain mister spock what happened
what do you mean
you transported over and came right back did they call it off
how long were we gone
long about two minutes guess don understand
the vedala changed their minds the danger is past back to your stations we have lot of other places to go enterprise is orbiting very red planet and kirk is checking his appearance in mirror
dress uniforms spit and polish don know how much longer going to be able to stand this feel like my neck in sling
the vulcans are the last delegates we have to pick up as soon as we get them aboard we ll be able to relax they leave
sure formal reception tonight hundred and fourteen delegates aboard for two weeks thirty two of them ambassadors spock joins them half of them mad at the other half and the whole lot touchier than raw antimatter pile over this coridan question intercom whistles
kirk here estimate arrival one minute
bring them aboard mister chekov hangar deck as the ncc1701/7 arrives the honour guard smarted themselves up outside recovering shuttlecraft hangar deck pressurising the guard line up holding phasers with arms crossed
how does that vulcan salute go spock demonstrates right hand with the fingers separated into v-sign
that hurts worse than the uniform couple are escorted from the shuttlecraft
captain james kirk
captain
my first officer commander spock
vulcan honours us with your presence we come to serve
your service honours us captain
thank you chief medical officer doctor mccoy
ambassador
doctor my aides and she who is my wife he holds out his right hand with two fingers extended and human woman steps forward to touch them
captain kirk
our pleasure madam as soon as you re settled ll arrange tour of the ship mister spock will conduct you
prefer another guide captain
as you wish ambassador mister spock we ll leave orbit in two hours would you care to beam down and visit your parents
captain ambassador sarek and his wife are my parents captain log stardate 3842 we have departed vulcan for the neutral planetoid code-named babel since it is in our sector the enterprise has been assigned to transport ambassadors of federation planets to this vitally important council the issues of the council are politically complex the passengers explosive kirk is conducting sarek and amanda tour himself spock is doing something in engineering when they enter
this is the engineering section there are number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls over here are number of control computers amanda lags behind to talk with her son
after all these years among humans you still haven learned to smile
humans smile with so little provocation
and you haven come to see us in four years either
the situation between my father and myself has not changed
my wife attend
mister spock moment if you please
yes captain
explain the computer components
gave spock his first instruction in computers captain he chose to devote his knowledge to starfleet instead of the vulcan science academy
if you will excuse me captain leaves
sorry ambassador did not mean to offend thought that
offence is human emotion returning to my quarters continue my wife leaves
mrs sarek just don understand
amanda afraid you couldn pronounce the vulcan name
can you
after fashion and after many years of practice shall we continue the tour my husband did request it
it sounded more like command
of course he vulcan his wife
and spock is his son
you don understand the vulcan way captain it logical it better way than ours but it not easy it has kept spock and sarek from speaking as father and son for eighteen years
spock is my best officer and my friend
glad he has such friend it hasn been easy on spock neither human nor vulcan at home nowhere except starfleet
take it that spock disagreed with his father on choice of career
my husband has nothing against starfleet but vulcans believe that peace should not depend on force
starfleet force is used only as last resort we re an instrument of civilisation and it better opportunity for scientist to study the universe than he can get at the vulcan science academy
perhaps but sarek wanted spock to follow his teachings as sarek followed the teachings of his own father
they are both stubborn
human trait captain
excuse me kirk here few symbols nothing intelligible
source there wasn enough of it sensors show nothing in the area but it was strong signal as though it was very close
go to alert status four begin long-range scanning kirk out captain log stardate 3842 the interplanetary conference will consider the petition of the coridan planets to be admitted to the federation the coridan system has been claimed by some of the races now aboard our ship as delegates races who have strong personal reasons for keeping coridan out of the federation the most pressing problem aboard the enterprise is to make sure open warfare doesn break out among the delegates before the conference begins people of all shapes sizes and colours are helping themselves to drinks and nibbles from buffet tables
mister ambassador understand you had retired before this conference was called forgive my curiosity but as doctor interested in vulcan physiology isn it unusual for vulcan to retire at your age after all you re only hundred and two
one hundred two point four three seven precisely doctor measured in your years had other concerns
ambassador
stout chap with porcine nose sarek of vulcan do you vote to admit coridan to the federation
the vote will not be taken here ambassador gav my government instructions will be heard in the council chambers on babel
no you how do you vote sarek of vulcan
thin and blue with two antennae why must you know tellarite
in council his vote carries others will know where he stands and why
tellarites do not argue for reasons they simply argue
no you
gentlemen ambassador sarek is quite correct when he points out this is not the council chamber of babel fully aware that the admission of coridan is highly debatable issue but you won solve it here
you are correct captain quite logical
my apologies captain
you will excuse me stalks away
have you met gav before ambassador
we debated during my last council session ambassador
ambassador gav lost
spock ve always suspected that you were little more human than you let on mrs sarek know about the rigorous training of the vulcan youth but tell me did he ever run and play like the human children even in secret
well he he did have pet sehlat he was very fond of
sehlat
it sort of fat teddy bear
teddy bear
excuse me doctor it has been rather long day for my wife captain
ambassador sarek leads amanda away
teddy bear
not precisely doctor on vulcan the teddy bears are alive and they have six-inch fangs
kirk here pacing us
on my way all duty personnel on yellow alert don alarm the passengers kirk out
report
small ship captain it been there five minutes remaining outside phaser range at extreme limit of sensors
identification spock
sensors indicate the size of scout ship but the configuration is unfamiliar most unusual
does she answer hail
ve tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal translator no response sir kirk; maintain translator broadcast check records for authorised ships
starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours
care to guess what she is
guess captain shall need more data for my estimate
mister chekov plot course to intercept that vessel want to see what she looks like close up
aye sir
you embarrassed spock this evening not even mother may do that he is vulcan
he also human
he starfleet officer
thought you didn approve of starfleet
it is not question of approval the fact exists he is in starfleet he must command respect if he is to function
sarek you re proud of him aren you you re showing almost human pride in your son
it does not require pride to ask that spock be given the respect which is his due not as my son but as spock do you understand
not really but it doesn matter love you anyway know it isn logical
vessel changing course heading toward us at high warp speed
ready main phasers
phasers armed and ready sir the bright dot on the viewscreen whizzes past them
interesting they were travelling at approximately warp ten
back on original course mister chekov report on intruder movements
captain starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and confirms no authorised federation vessel in this quadrant
back on original heading captain the intruder changed course immediately after we did it paralleling us again
well we have shadow faster more manoeuvrable and unidentified mister spock full analysis of sensor readings want to know who that intruder is sarek enters and surreptitiously takes tablet with drink
vulcan would speak to you
it does seem unavoidable
how do you vote on the coridan admission
you seem unwilling to wait for the council meeting ambassador no matter we favour admission
you favour why the room goes silent
under federation law coridan can be protected and its wealth administered for the benefit of its people
that well for you vulcan has no mining interest
coridan has nearly unlimited wealth of dilithium crystals but it is under-populated and unprotected this invites illegal mining operations
illegal you accuse us
some of your ships have been carrying coridan dilithium crystals
you call us thieves gav attacks sarek who shrugs him off easily
gentlemen gentlemen whatever arguments you have between yourselves is your business my business is running the ship as long as command there will be order
of course captain
understood there will be payment for your slander sarek
threats are illogical and payment is usually expensive gav leaves the tellarite is hanging upside down from jefferies tube he is not doing spine stretching exercises
security to captain kirk
kirk here ve just found one of the tellarites murdered think it the ambassador himself sir
how was he killed
his neck was broken by an expert
explain
well from the nature and location of the break say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly
who aboard would have that knowledge
vulcans on vulcan the method is called tal-shaya it was considered merciful form of execution in ancient times
spock short time ago broke up an argument between gav and your father
indeed captain interesting
interesting spock do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect
vulcans do not approve of violence
you re saying he couldn have done it
no captain merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason
but if he had reason could he have done it
if there were reason my father is quite capable of killing logically and efficiently
mrs sarek sorry to disturb you must speak to your husband
he been gone for some time it his habit to meditate in private before retiring what wrong spock
you want something of me captain
ambassador the tellarite gav has been murdered
his neck was broken mister ambassador by what spock describes as tal-shaya
indeed interesting
yes ambassador where were you during the past hour
captain you re not accusing him
mother if only on circumstantial evidence he is logical suspect
quite agree
then where were you during the hour
in private meditation captain spock will tell you that such meditation is personal experience not to be discussed especially not with earthmen
that very convenient excuse ambassador sarek suddenly collapses
sarek sarek what wrong
it difficult to say with vulcan physiology but believe it something to do with his cardiovascular system
can you help him
don know that yet either
spock
yes captain get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship hull
sorry about your father
yes it could adversely affect our mission
aren you worried about him
worry is human emotion captain accept what has happened the ship hull seems to have high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes it is manned but sensors cannot make out specifics
see well the romulans have nothing like it certainly not the federation or the neutral planets what about the klingons
think it unlikely it is one of theirs
who then
captain picked up the last part of transmission just like that other one put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately
mister chekov directional locator indicates source bearing twenty seven mark eight
it the intruder ship sir
switch recorder to mister spock station for decode lieutenant
sir the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship
personal receiver somebody on board is in contact with that vessel
possibly captain but cannot decode this transmission
why not
it is in no known code there no detectable pattern no standard references apply
are any conclusions possible from the information
only negative it fits none of our computer records and it is alien
murder someone out there playing tag lieutenant you ve got your sensor locator on wide beam you ve established receiver on board this vessel tighten your field to the interior of the ship
yes sir
if that alien vessel starts transmitting again want to know who on board the enterprise is receiving
bones how is he
as far as can tell from instrument readings our prime suspect has malfunction in one of the heart valve it similar to heart attack in human but with vulcan physiology it impossible to tell without an operation mrs sarek has he had any previous attacks
no
yes there were three others my physician prescribed benjisidrine for the condition
why didn you tell me
there was nothing you could have done
ambassador when did you have these attacks
two before we left vulcan the third few hours ago was on the observation deck when the tellarite was murdered was quite incapacitated
there were no witnesses
none
doctor do you propose surgery for the heart defect
not sure it tough enough on human on vulcan an ordinary operation out of the question
why
because of the construction of the vulcan heart
suggest that cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach
yes unquestionably
bones what about it
well glad somebody asking me something around here well the procedure they re discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient
doctor
yes
ve checked the blood bank there isn enough vulcan blood and plasma to even begin such an operation of this type
there are other vulcans aboard
my blood type is t-negative somewhat rare even for vulcan
yes say that rare
my blood is t-negative doctor
we ve run number of blood tests on mister spock it isn true vulcan blood either it has human blood elements in it
it should be possible to filter out the human factors
even you couldn give that much blood spock it would kill you
bones
mrs sarek you must understand the chances are extremely small to find way to produce sufficient t-negative blood
indeed would estimate the odds
please don
doctor
see it spock but that was rigelian
rigelian physiology is very similar to vulcan
similar is not good enough it still experimental
but it does look promising
spock we would need such great amounts of blood that even if the drug worked on the vulcans as well as rigelian which doubtful it would still drain sarek to critical level
consider the safety factor low but acceptable
plus the fact ve never operated on vulcan before oh ve studied the anatomical types know where all the organs are but that lot different from actual surgical experience so if don kill him with the operation the drug probably will
what drug doctor my husband is asleep what drug
chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body it only experimental
it has been used successfully on test subjects on rigel five
it places tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver in sarek condition the stimulant would kill him
miss chapel underwent physical examination last week would you pull those records please
already pulled you re perfectly healthy mister spock
what has that got
you re going to use it on yourself transfusion from you to your father
it would seem the only answer
it could damage you internally it could kill you sorry spock can sanction it
and refuse to permit it won risk both of you
then you automatically condemn sarek to death and you doctor have no logical alternative either if you do not operate sarek will die you now have the means to perform the operation am volunteering myself as the blood donor ll be at my station until you require me kirk is in the middle of vigorous fight with an andorian the blue people with antennae the andorian pulls knife and stabs kirk before getting kicked unconscious
bridge spock
spock here
on deck five near my quarters ve been attacked by an andorian security security team he passes out captain log stardate 3843 first officer spock in temporary command the captain has been critically wounded by one of the delegates to the babel conference the ship is on alert status we are still being followed by the intruder vessel
it bad wound punctured left lung centimetre or so lower it have gone through the heart
ll be in the brig questioning the andorian prisoner
monitoring sarek doctor the k2 factor is dropping
spock your father is much worse there no longer choice have to operate immediately we can begin as soon as you re prepared
no doctor
what
my first responsibility is to the ship our passengers safety is by starfleet order of first importance we are being followed by an alien possibly hostile vessel cannot relinquish command under these circumstances
you can turn command over to scotty
on what grounds doctor command requirements do not recognise personal privilege ll be in the brig interrogating the andorian
he is thelev minor member of my staff know nothing of him except that he has served adequately
he has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug he reveals nothing suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of preconceived plan
my people are violent race but we ve no quarrel with captain kirk
apparently thelev did
you suggest plot how could it profit us to harm the captain
do not know there is no logic in thelev attack upon the captain there is no logic in gav murder
perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain those are reasons for murder the doorbell rings impatiently
come in
spock you must turn command over to somebody else
mother when was commissioned took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified
any competent officer can command this ship only you can give your father the blood transfusions that he needs to live
any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances the circumstances are not normal we re carrying over one hundred valuable federation passengers we re being pursued by an alien ship we re subject to possible attack there has been murder and attempted murder on board cannot dismiss my duties
duty your duty is to your father
know but this must take precedence if could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency would sarek understands my reason
well don it not human that not dirty word you re human too let that part of you come through your father dying
mother how can you have lived on vulcan so long married vulcan raised son on vulcan without understanding what it means to be vulcan
if this is what it means don want to know
it means to adopt philosophy way of life which is logical and beneficial we cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain no matter how important that gain might be
nothing is as important as your father life
can you imagine what my father would say if were to agree if were to give up command of this vessel jeopardise hundreds of lives risk interplanetary war all for the life of one person
when you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped anguished because the other boys tormented you saying that you weren really vulcan watched you knowing that inside that the human part of you was crying and cried too there must be some part of me in you some part that still can reach if being vulcan is more important to you then you ll stand there speaking rules and regulations from starfleet and vulcan philosophy and let your father die and ll hate you for the rest of my life
mother
oh go to him now please
cannot she slaps his face and storms out
doctor mccoy
like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer
the one who hit you
no the one inside my head how long have tries to sit up and fails
now let that be lesson to you just lie there and be happy you re still alive
how sarek
not good if could only operate
what stopping you thought you were all ready
was when you became injured spock assumed command he going to stay there until you re back on your feet even if it costs sarek his life regulations
can damn him for his loyalty for doing his duty but not going to let him commit patricide
jim if you stand you could start to bleed again
bones sarek will die without that operation and you can operate without transfusions from spock ll convince spock all right and order him to report here as soon as he leaves the bridge ll turn command over to scotty and report to my quarters will that fill your prescription
captain
ll take over mister spock you report to sickbay with doctor mccoy
captain are you quite all right
ve certified him physically fit mister spock now since have an operation to perform and both of us are required
get out spock chekov what the status of the intruder
no change sir maintaining its distance
any further transmissions lieutenant
none sir the turbolift doors close on spock and mccoy
call mister scott to the bridge
captain the alien vessel is moving closer
belay that order ll stay here
captain picking up the alien signal again but it coming from inside the enterprise
specific origin
from the brig sir
security security to the brig search the prisoner immediately
readings nurse
mister spock blood reproduction rate is up over two hundred percent sarek heartbeat has risen to three hundred and twenty four blood pressure ninety over forty dropping
wish knew whether that was good or bad initiate sterile field
mister spock spock is starting to get up
where do you think you re going
must see the captain
my patients don walk out in the middle of an operation
the alien ship ve just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm it should be possible to identify them this way very important chapel gives him hypo to put him to sleep
so is your father life
kirk here sort of transceiver it was hidden in his antenna
captain the alien ship has changed course and speed moving directly toward us at warp eight
bring the prisoner to the bridge deflectors on red alert phasers stand by to fire on my order
aye sir shields on phasers manned and ready sir
chekov take over spock scanners
aye sir the little light flashes past and the enterprise rocks
target mister chekov
moving away turning now he coming around again
fire as he passes ensign
clean miss sir
report on his weaponry mister chekov
sensors record standard phasers sir
standard phasers good they may have more speed but they re not giants
captain the intercoms are jammed all the ambassadors are asking what going on
tell them to take good guess but clear that board lieutenant
aye sir
he coming around again another hit and jolt
one more like that and going to lose both these men spock is awake again another attack
fire control locked into the computers captain
on my order fire photon torpedoes two four and six widest possible scatter
aye sir
fire
full spread missed sir they re moving too fast for us
doctor his heart stopped
cardio-stimulate another jolt
the systems are off
then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator she fetches hand-sized device from trolley
call engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority
number four shield has buckled sir
auxiliary power
switching over shields firming up number four is still weak sir if they hit us there again it ll go altogether sickbay gets its power back thelev is brought to the bridge
your friends out there are good they ll have to destroy this ship to win
that was intended from the beginning captain
you re not andorian who are you
damage reports coming in captain every deck
damage control procedures all decks that ship out there has phasers at least our weapons are alike
number two shield is gone
engineering this is the captain cut power on port side except for phaser banks at my signal cut starboard power kirk out who are you
find your own answers captain you haven long to live
you re spy surgically altered to pass as an andorian planted in the ambassador party to use terror and murder to disrupt us and prepare for this attack
speculation captain
engineering cut power on starboard side maintain until further orders chekov in the darkened ship chekov takes back his usual station
what are you doing
you speculate
we re starting to drift sir shall hold her on course
no stand by your phasers mister chekov
aye sir phasers standing by he just hovering out there sir
looking us over we re dead as far as he knows
you re baiting him you re trying to lure him in
here he comes range decreasing speed dropping close to sublight
hold your fire mister chekov
phasers locked on target range closing seventy five thousand kilometres
fire there satisfying flare on the viewscreen
got him
secure from general quarters lieutenant open the hailing frequency if they wish to surrender very big flare makes everyone shield their eyes
they could not surrender captain they had orders to self-destruct while in sickbay sarek vital signs are strengthening
lieutenant relay to starfleet command tell them we have prisoner
aye sir
only temporarily captain you see had orders to self-destruct too slow poison quite painless actually but there no known antidote anticipate another ten minutes of life
take him to sickbay
seem to have miscalculated he dies with the security guards holding his arms
so did they mister chekov take over
bones
are you quite through shaking the ship around
spock sarek how are they
don mind telling you you sure make it difficult for surgeon trying
bones
captain come in they go through to the ward
that pig-headed vulcan stamina couldn have pulled them through without it
some doctors have all the luck
captain believe you ll find the alien
we damaged their ship they destroyed themselves to avoid capture bones thelev body will be brought to your lab want an autopsy performed as soon as possible
think you ll find he an orion doctor
orion
intelligence reports that orion smugglers have been raiding the coridan system
but what would they gain by an attack on starfleet
mutual suspicion and interplanetary war
yes of course with orion carefully neutral they clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid coridan
the thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve it made them seem more powerful than starship or anything known to us that ship was constructed for suicide mission since they never intended to return to their home base they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks the thing don understand is why didn think of it earlier
you might have had something else on your mind
that hardly seems likely
no but thank you anyway
and you sarek would you also say thank you to your son
don understand
for saving your life
spock acted in the only logical manner open to him one does not thank logic amanda
logic logic sick to death of logic do you want to know how feel about your logic
emotional isn she
she has always been that way
indeed why did you marry her
at the time it seemed the logical thing to do
bones starts to collapse no no all right mccoy helps him onto bed
if you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor you re going to spend your next ten days right here if you co-operate you ll be out in two
doctor ll return to my station now
you are at your station mister spock
doctor mccoy believe you re enjoying all this
indeed captain ve never seen him look so happy
shut up to kirk shh shh to camera well what do you know finally got the last word
approaching sigma iotia two captain
standard orbit mister chekov
captain have received vocal contact from an official station they relayed us to man named oxmyx his title is boss
boss all right lieutenant put him on oxmyx this is captain james kirk of the starship enterprise representing the federation of planets
yes unfortunately the horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet we only received her radio report last month here hundred years ago
difficult to explain we received report hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy they didn have subspace communication in those days
ll explain it in more detail when see him the ship won land but we ll transport several people down well that little difficult for you to understand too ll explain it in more detail when see you where will be convenient near yellow fire plug think you can find it kirk goes over to the engineering station
scotty do you have the co-ordinates
located sir kirk; good mister oxmyx we have your intersection located will five minutes be all right you
good ll be looking forward to it kirk out scotty you have the conn mccoy and spock enter from the turbolift
spock mccoy we re beaming down standard equipment
the horizon contact came before the non-interference directive went into effect
they must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet
it will be interesting to see the results of the contamination
we don know there is contamination the evidence is only circumstantial
what was the state of the iotian culture before the horizon came
the beginnings of industrialisation
horizon reports indicate the iotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative
so we re going down to recontaminate them
the damage has been done doctor we are here to repair it
let not argue about it let go study it energise there yellow fire hydrant litter girl in 1930 dress motor cars shops and men standing around carrying machine guns welcome to chicago
fascinating
this is like coming home
home was never like this ve seen pictures of the old days that look like this
interesting captain passers-by are carrying believe firearms they are approached by two men in neat suits with machine guns
in brown suit okay you three let see you petrify
sir would you mind explaining that statement please
want to see you turn to stone put your hands over your head or you ain going to have no head to put your hands over they are deprived of their phasers and communicators
what this
that weapon be careful with that
heater huh hey the boss will love that puts it in his pocket
look we were asked to come down here by mister oxmyx he said
know what he said bud he said some of the boys would meet you okay we re meeting you
well those firearms are not necessary
you trying to make trouble
who me
don give me those baby blue eyes
what
don go for that innocent routine
sir does everyone here carry firearms
never heard such stupid questions in my life
well since this oxmyx asked us down here don you think we should see him
all right get moving down the street just then car comes hurtling around the corner everyone dives for cover and gunfire rings out the silent man in the blue suit gets shot kalo returns fire as the car speeds away
krako getting more gall all the time
is this how you greet all your guests
it happens pal
that man dead back there
yeah we ain playing for peanuts what the matter you guys never saw hit before
sir there are several questions would like to ask
ask the boss don know nothing get moving they leave the crowd to deal with the deceased
this is the contamination you re looking for jim
yes but the horizon crew wasn composed of cold-blooded killers they didn report this culture in this state either what happened
hey kalo hey when the boss going to do something about the crummy street lights around here eh girl ain safe
and how about the laundry pickup we ain had truck by in three weeks
write him letter
did he sent it back with postage due
listen we pay our percentages we re entitled to little service for our money
get lost will ya some people got nothing to do but complain
is this the way your citizens do business their right of petition
they pay their percentages and the boss takes care of them it lovely high-ceilinged room with wood paneling tiled floor with carpet and substantial furniture buzzer sounds
silver haired man in suit hit that button the girl sitting on his desk obeys yeah
all right bring them in he goes to the pool table and picks up cue which one of you is the captain
depends
make yourself drink captain it good stuff distill it myself
no thank you you re mister oxmyx
that me pal
this is my first officer mister spock doctor mccoy
doctor huh put that chopper down kalo these guys are our guests pick up cue captain go ahead you can be too careful around here these days
yes judging from what we ve seen so far agree
they call you the boss mister oxmyx the boss of what
the boss of my territory got the biggest in the world you know there one thing wrong with having the biggest there always some punk trying to cut you out that why you can be too careful
you re the government here
what government look told you got the territory and run it that all
but there are other bosses other territories
yeah sure maybe dozen or so not counting the small fry but then they get burned anyway soon as get around to it
does that include if may ask gentleman called krako
how do you know about krako
he hit us boss
okay you hit him back you hear hard
ll take care of it spock has discovered book on lectern
captain gangsters chicago mobs published in 1992 where you get this
hey wait minute that the book
know it book
the book they left it the other ship the horizon
this is the contamination captain astonishing an entire culture based on this
you said they were imitative and the book
don want any more cracks about the book
did they leave any other books
sure some text books on how to make radio sets and stuff like that but look brought you here so you could help me not for you to ask me questions after that ll answer anything you want to know
what is it you want
well was thinking you feds must have made lot of improvements since that other ship came here you probably got all kinds of fancy heaters up there so here the deal you give me all the heaters need enough tools so can knock off those punks all at once then ll take over and all you ll have to do is deal with me
now let me get this straight you want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours
what aggression got to make hits want you to help me hit them that all
fascinating but quite impossible
mister oxmyx my orders are quite explicit under no circum
ain interested in your orders from now on you re gonna take orders from me gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things want if don have those tools by then gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in box is that understood pal kalo and another henchman put their guns to kirk head
hey boss this here heater and don know what this is tosses them to his leader
let see how this thing works
don do that you could knock out the side of the building
that good huh all you have to do is give me about hundred of these fancy heaters and we ll have no more trouble
out of the question
captain kirk usually get what want what this thing silence all right burn him
hold it it communication device
how does it work
it locked onto my ship systems
kalo take them to the warehouse and put them in bag keep sharp eye on them you hear
in the bag boss come on the landing party and the gunmen leave
into communicator hey you in the ship up there
scott here who this
this is bela oxmyx got your captain and his friends down here you want to see them alive these fancy heaters you ve got and some troops to show me how to use them
am to understand that you re holding the captain and his party
you heard right pal going to give you just eight hours to get me the goods want or put the hit on your friends
don know oxmyx ends the transmission laughing lieutenant hadley check the language banks and find out what heater is the guards are sitting at makeshift table playing cards whilst the landing party sit on various barrels and crates
one book on the gangs of chicago did all this it amazing
they evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society
it the bible
in old chicago conventional government almost broke down the gangs nearly took over
yeah well oxmyx is the worst gangster of all
we may quarrel with mister oxmyx methods but his goal is essentially the correct one this society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy
if this society broke down as the result of the horizon influence then the federation responsible and we ve got to do something to straighten this mess out spock if you could get to the sociological computer do you think you could find solution
unfortunately do not have access to my computers nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it
well ve got an idea about that goes over to the card table and gets guns pointed at him gentlemen gentlemen this card game is kid game
you think so huh
oh yes yes wouldn waste my time
who asking you
on beta antares four they play real game it man game but of course it probably little beyond you it requires intelligence
listen kirk can play anything you can figure out take the cards big man show us how it played
familiar with the culture on beta antares there aren games
spock spock sits of course the cards on beta antares four are different but not too different the name of the game is called fizzbin
fizzbin
fizzbin it not too difficult begins dealing each player gets six cards except for the player on the dealer right who gets seven
on the right
yes the second card is turned up except on tuesdays
on tuesday
oh look what you got two jacks you got half fizzbin already
need another jack
no no if you got another jack why you have sralk
sralk
yes you be disqualified you need king and deuce except at night of course when you need queen and four
except at night
right oh look at that you ve got another jack how lucky you are how wonderful for you if you didn get another jack if you gotten king why then you get another card except when it dark you give it back
if it were dark on tuesday
yes but what you re after is royal fizzbin but the odds in getting royal fizzbin are astron spock what are the odds in getting royal fizzbin
have never computed them captain
well they re astronomical believe me now for the last card we ll call it kronk you got that
what kirk accidentally drops the card on the floor
ll get it as he bends down spock nock-pinches him while mccoy and kirk punch out the other two men mccoy is quicker than kirk
spock find the radio station uhura monitoring the broadcasts cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship
surely you re coming captain
will but bringing bela oxmyx with me
jim you can
bones this mess is our responsibility you have your orders let go kirk is running along carrying machine gun when voice rings out man in light grey suit and straw boater accosts him
hold it okay pally we re going for ride
if you don mind rather walk
listen pally this could either be taxi or hearse you know what mean
beginning to get the idea they climb into the back of very nice car woman is about to put the needle onto record when spock neck-pinches her
you do that very well now how are you with primitive radio equipment
very simple amplitude modulation transmission simply adjust the frequency throw this switch and the enterprise should answer request time brought to you by bang-bang the makers of the sweetest little automatic in the world
fascinating
and very simple
let me see throws few more switches and picks up the microphone enterprise this is mister spock
mister spock what are you doing on this frequency
very long and complicated story lieutenant notify the transporter room two to beam up these co-ordinates the brass plaque by the front door of the building proclaims jojo krako boss southside territory the straw boaters are the badge of his organisation jojo is practising throwing darts over his shoulder at poster of oxmyx kirk is brought in there copy of the book on lectern here too
so you re the fed huh well well well well well
and you
krako jojo krako the head of the whole southside territory hey glad to see you
would you mind telling me how you even know who am
sit down kirk ve got all of bela communications bugged he can make date with broad unless know about it well guess you want to know why brought you here
you want to make deal
hey like that that is sharp that sharp eh zabo
sharp boss
that right deal want you to help me he snaps his fingers and the girl walks over to kirk and starts massaging his shoulders
let me guess you want you ll want heaters and then you ll want troops to teach them how to use them and then you ll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet then we ll sit down and talk right
wrong know bela he didn offer you beans now me reasonable man you give me what want and ll cut you in for say third skimmed right off the top well what do you think
got better idea this planet has to be united you know that bela knows that let sit down you me bela discuss this whole matter contact the other bosses and talk about it like reasonable men
you watch it kirk the book tells us how to handle things snaps his fingers to recall the girl you make hits somebody argues you lean on em what do you think we re stupid or something
no don think you re stupid just think your behaviour is arrested
haven been arrested in my whole life listen pally know how to get what want you want to live don you kirk you bet you do but after get through with you you re liable to be sorry unless you come across hold him here tell cirl the knife to sharpen up his blade just might have job for him unless you come across with the heaters
sorry krako no deal
that too bad put him on ice they put him in proper working office with letter opener desk with blotting paper cot-bed and nice old radio with nice old valves and stuff inside kirk starts taking it apart
well
futile doctor no specifics there is no record of such culture based on moral inversion
you mean you re giving up
no doctor merely saying the computers can offer us no logical rational factual way out of our current dilemma
mister spock mister oxmyx is making contact from the surface
on audio lieutenant mister oxmyx this is mister spock
irrelevant since we are here
oh yeah tell you you better come on back down
why would he put bag on our captain
kidnapped him you dope
if understand you correctly that would seem to be problem
look you guys got something want can help you get your captain back
afraid find it difficult to trust you mister oxmyx
what to trust business is business we ll call truce you come on down talk about giving me hand
you ll show no further hostility
businessman pally what do ya say
since we must have our captain back accept ten minutes spock out
you mean you re going to trust him
if we are to save the captain without blatant forceful interference on this planet doctor we must have the assistance of someone indigenous we are therefore forced to trust mister oxmyx kirk has used copper wire to create trip-wire and starts throwing the waste paper bin around to make noise
help me help help me henchman dashes in and goes flying over the wire kirk kicks him unconscious then uses blanket to disorient zabo when he comes in before knocking him out too taking weapon and making his escape
mister scott though we hope to avoid interference suggest you set one of our phaser banks on strong stun position
aye sir
now you re beginning to make sense
trust we shall not have to use them but it is best to be prepared energise
you know what to do
don worry boss they can do nothing till they re through sparkling
just the same you be careful they ll have heaters on them to his girl now you watch this spock and mccoy arrive and are promptly taken prisoner ship log mister spock reporting incredible as it seems doctor mccoy and are once again prisoners of the chief criminal boss of society patterned after old earth gangsters
taking the phasers pick up many more of these won need your co-operation
mister oxmyx understood we had an arrangement truce
was hoping you think that dummy
we re trying to help you oxmyx
nobody helps nobody but himself
sir you are employing double negative
huh
fail to see why you do not understand us you yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet we agree
yeah but got to be the unity
co-operation sir would inevitably result
the most co-operative man in this world is dead man and if you don keep your mouth shut you re going to be co-operatin the door opens and kirk enters with his machine gun
drop the guns drop em mccoy and spock take back their phasers move down there
hey captain you got away from krako you know that ain easy
thought you were supposed to report to the ship mister spock
we did captain the situation required our return
it may be just as well did you find out anything from the computer
nothing useful logic and practical information do not seem to apply here
you admit that
to deny the facts would be illogical doctor
then you don mind if play hunch
not sanguine about hunches captain but have no practical alternative
what are we going to do now jim
well now that we have bela going to put the bag on krako grabs the guy in blue suit listen you say that nice material
it ought to be it cost bundle kirk; get out of em
hey
said
now just minute
you too get out of the clothes nobody going to put the bag on me any more kirk is in the blue suit and spock in kalo brown one when they leave bela headquarters and go over to the cream sedan parked by the kerb
wheels mister spock
fliwer captain
key in the ignition turn the ignition on and nothing happens where the starter there the starter yes
interesting
pushing the gear lever and making grinding noises oops gears
yes oh believe they had device known as clutch clutch captain perhaps one of those pedals on the floor
puts it quietly into gear kind of like this going to get one myself he lets up the clutch and they go backwards the car kangaroos elegantly down the street and somehow makes it to jojo place
captain you are an excellent starship commander but as taxi driver you leave much to be desired
it was that bad they get out and note the guards at the main entrance
now that could be bit of problem if they were inside where they couldn be seen we could stun them with our phasers but not out here
if we can get close enough to them we should be able to render them harmless with reasonable rapidity guard checks the contents of passing perambulator
they don look like the trusting type
runs over to them it hit ain it
beg your pardon
you re going to hit somebody can watch
young man run along and play
where you get them ears
young man
you going to hit krako out here you open up and you ll be scragged from every window in the street can fix it for ya
young man this is likely to be quite hazardous
hold on spock out of the mouths of babes
who you callin babe
calling you babe
you calling me babe brandishes his little knife
yeah calling you babe but there nothing personal in it sit down on the car bumper you know way we can get close to them
sure
how
what in it for me
what do you want
piece of the action
you do not even know what the action is going to be
figure it got to be thick percentage or you wouldn be trying to hit krako
logical
all right young man we ll guarantee you piece of the action if we can pull this thing off
is that contract
done they shake on it what do we do
you ll know what to do he skips across the street fighting imaginary enemies with his very real knife
and that and how do you like that think you can gang up on me huh what are you chicken the guards grin as he runs over to them
come on why don you gang up on me ll cut off your head and throw it in your face take that and that and falls over daddy daddy hurt myself

cute kid ain he
daddy want my daddy
sonny

sonny wait moment what have they done what have they done to you what have you done kirk hits one while spock neck-pinches the other there bit of argy-bargy just inside the door before it over
piece of the action
no one can see put your phaser on stun they stun two guards in the corridor in front of them krako is coming down the stairs with his girl
well ain this nice was wondering how was going to get you back and here you deliver yourself who your friend with the ears kirk
think you ve got it reversed mister krako
ain pally put down your heaters
captain believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says just heard the sound of
the sound of machine gun bolt being pulled back there are two more guards behind them jojo is shaking phaser to make it work
mister krako don er
so this is the fancy heater huh how does it work
trying to tell you mister krako that this is bigger than you oxmyx or anyone
the only thing want you to tell me is how it works
can you trust all your men
of course can
well one of these can make man pretty big boss you know
either trust em or they re dead let go in here and talk about it
now we got no busy little eyes to worry about how does this thing work
all right krako we don have time to show you how to play with toys takes the phaser back
toys
what do you think we re here for to get cut of your deal forget it that peanuts to an outfit like the federation right
unquestionably
right
right
now look krako we re taking over the whole ball of wax you co-operate with us and maybe we ll cut you in for piece of the action
miniscule very small piece
how much is that
that er we ll figure it out later
thought you guys had laws no interference
who interfering we re taking over check
right
the planet is being taken over by the federation but we don want to come in here and use our muscle you know what mean that ain subtle so what we do is we help one guy take over the planet he pulls the strings and then we pull his to spock hey you sit down they settle them selves with their feet up on krako desk
what your cut

waking up oh not again rouses the other man hey wake up you all right opens the door hey you guys come in here the feds snatched krako never seen anything like it they re going to move in unless we stop em now
yeah how
well bela mixed up in this somehow ve got sneaking hunch they re going to high-tail it back to his territory you know what we re going to do we re going to hit his place

all right you know what to do we hit bela place and nobody comes out alive all right let go it getting crowded and noisy the minor bosses are all sporting bowler hats krako is there too kirk is standing on the pool table
all right all right all right all right now the federation taking over whether you like it or not you people you ve been running this planet like piecework factory from now on it going to be under one roof you re going to run it like business that means you re going to make profit
and what your percentage
cutting the federation in for forty percent you got any objections
yeah hear lot of talk but all see here is you and couple of your boys don see no federation
listen they got ship know was there
wait minute wait minute tepo got point all we ever seen is them
what couple of boys
not going to believe my eyes general bedlam
hang on minute hang on minute quiet just moment
let me say something only saw three guys in that ship maybe there ain no more
there are over four hundred guys there

already seen it you re nothing fed
all right but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye
well all right go ahead don get smart
hello scotty this is kirk
enterprise scott here sir one-block radius around these co-ordinates
right away sir scott out the street outside is filled with green light and everyone falls down the watching bosses are stunned into silence for moment
gee that some trick
hey did you see that
they re not dead just knocked out for while but they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to
okay okay kirk so we get the message now what was this syndicate deal you were talking about
he was talking about percentage
was talking about both
okay syndicate makes sense to me peaceful man at heart but sick and tired of all these hits hit krako krako hits tepo tepo hits me there too many bosses we can get anything done was thinking if there was just one maybe somebody like you as the top boss then we can get things done
hey bela no no no the federation can get connected with small-time operation like this no was thinking bela you would be the top boss krako you be his lieutenant the rest of you don want any trouble from the rest of you because you ll have to answer to the federation we ll be back every year to collect our cut
look you figure maybe forty percent enough
yeah think forty percent sufficient
it reasonable it sounds reasonable that sound reasonable to you chorus of approval
it reasonable mister oxmyx let break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate
gentlemen you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship
brooding captain
brooding mister spock sombre emotional state now do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it
captain neither brooding nor sombre but do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the iotians
ah yes understand that you don think it logical to leave criminal organisation in charge
highly irregular to say the least captain also curious as to how you propose to explain to starfleet command that starship will be sent each year to collect our cut
yes that very good question mister spock propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the iotians into more ethical system despite themselves they ll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities isn that logical all right bones in the language of the planet what your beef
don know how serious this is jim and don quite know how to tell you
go ahead
but in all the confusion
tell me
think left it in bela office
you left it
somewhere not certain
you re not certain of what
left my communicator
in bela office
captain if the iotians who are very bright and imitative people should take that communicator apart
they will they will and they ll find out how the transtator works
the transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have
everything
you really think it that serious
serious serious bones it upsets the whole percentage
how do you mean
well in few years the iotians may demand piece of our action woman is doing belly-dance complete with finger-cymbals while the patrons lounge on cushions the audience are appreciating the show
captain think going to like argelius
obviously man of good taste
you mean to tell me all these women that all this is
yes yes yes the argelians think very highly of their pleasure
that an understatement if ever heard one this is completely hedonistic society
do you like her scotty
aye why shouldn
good ve invited her to join us at the table thought you might like to meet her
now that what call real captain always thinking of his men the dancer comes over bends over backwards then does shimmy before returning to the small stage to finish scotty bangs on the table in applause
scotty scotty in argelius they use the lights
now no one has to tell an old aberdeen pub-crawler how to applaud captain she comes over but the man at the next table doesn look too pleased with the situation
have one of our pillows the man leaves as she sits
tis fine foggy night tonight and doubt if anyone ever told you of the marvellous fogs we have in aberdeen
never word but dying to learn
well then why don show you there nothing like walk in the fog with bonny lass
or handsome gentleman why don we
you don mind do you might even get back to the ship on time
we won leave without you scotty relax and enjoy yourself scott and kara leave my work is never done
my work jim this is prescription stuff don forget the explosion that threw scotty against bulkhead was caused by woman
physically he all right am right in assuming that
oh yes yes as matter of fact considerable psychological damage could have been caused for example his total resentment toward women
he seems he overcoming his resentment
of course in my professional opinion when he gets back to the ship he going to hate you for making him leave argelius but then he will have lost total resentment toward women
mission accomplished as far as scotty is concerned bones know little place across town where the women
oh yes know the place let go the fog hangs very low on argelius somewhere just below knee level couples are meandering along lost in each other kirk works out which way to go then suddenly scream splits the night they run towards it and find the dancer on the ground
she dead jim
stabbed dozen times and standing by wall groaning with bloody knife in his hand is montgomery scott captain log stardate 3614 planet argelius two while on therapeutic shore leave mister scott has fallen under suspicion of having brutally murdered an argelian woman the chief city administrator mister hengist has taken charge of the investigation but has learned little of value
neat man in suit don know what to say gentlemen argelius is the last planet in the galaxy expect thing like this to happen
we re just as shocked as you are mister hengist
if this was my home planet rigel four have dozen investigators working on the matter but they don exist here
you re not native of argelius sir
oh no argelius hires its administrative officers from other planets the argelians aren very efficient you know gentle harmless people mister scott mister scott now are you sure you ve never seen this before the knife
don remember
really sir that is hardly helpful
scotty you left the cafe with the girl do you remember that what happened next
we were walking in the fog was up ahead trying to lead the way heard the girl scream remember starting to turn don remember another thing
scotty you ve got to remember
jim they move off little way if he says he can remember he probably doesn you know scotty
know murder been committed
you don think by any chance that scotty
it doesn make any difference what think
but you don just throw him to the wolves
bones have diplomatic responsibility this happened under argelian jurisdiction if they want to arrest him try him even convict him have to go along with it
but he suffering from severe concussion
we ll do what we can
it not promising captain mister scott insists he remembers nothing but my detector readings indicates that only his fingerprints are on the murder weapon
yes mister hengist there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder several of them left just before mister scott and the girl did
so ve been informed by the staff they re being located and we will question them but the outlook for your friend is quite grim
what the law in these cases
the law of argelius is love an elegant grey-haired man enters with woman
gentlemen our prefect jaris sir captain kirk doctor mccoy
and this is my wife sybo
and this man is scott the one sent you the message about
he does not look like man capable of such an act still it been so long gentlemen before our great awakening two hundred years ago we had ways of learning the truth in such matters we shall return to them
the argelian empathic contact
you know of this
yes we ve heard of it assumed it was lost art
my wife is descendent of the ancient priestesses of our land she has the ancestral gift gentlemen have come to invite you to my home
prefect don you think this should be handled in an official manner through my office
it shall be handled in an official manner mister hengist since am the highest official gentlemen let us proceed to my home where with the aid of my wife we shall learn the truth please the middle eastern theme continues with spiral columns onion-dome arches latticed windows and plenty of cushions
depending on your wife empathic abilities is all very well prefect but there only one way we can find out what it is mister scott cannot remember since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship can beam down technician with psycho-tricorder
prefect it will give us detailed account of everything that happened to mister scott in the last twenty four hours
oh advise against it prefect this is purely an argelian matter
my wife must meditate for time before she ready see no reason why we should not use that time to good advantage very well captain
kirk to enterprise
enterprise spock here
mister spock beam down technician with psycho-tricorder please use these co-ordinates
acknowledged co-ordinates received
kirk out
prefect the psycho-tricorder will require privacy to be effective
there is small chamber below this room perhaps that will suffice captain news of this frightful murder is spreading among my people they re greatly disturbed have already heard talk of closing argelius to space vehicles
well that would be most unfortunate argelian hospitality is well-known as well as its strategic importance as space port
yes believe it the only one in the quadrant hands out drinks captain
there are other people we should question perhaps should go expedite their arrival here
yes please do so mister hengist anyone with any connection with this murder should be present at the ceremony woman beams down as hengist leaves
lieutenant karen tracy reporting as ordered captain
lieutenant want twenty four hour regressive memory check made on mister scott
yes captain where shall set up
if you ll just follow me lieutenant jaris and karen leave
scotty co-operate completely with lieutenant tracy maybe we ll clear this thing up
certainly hope so sir can stand this not knowing leaves
captain under normal conditions scotty would have never done such thing
but that blow on the head it could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap
of course there another possibility
explain
hysterical amnesia when man feels guilty about something something too terrible to remember he blots it out of his conscious memory jaris returns and crosses to another doorway
are you ready sybo
am ready may have the knife please
certainly among other gifts sybo has the ability to receive impressions from inanimate objects do you have it captain
the knife no
but put it here when we arrived it gone woman scream fills the air karen tracy is lying face down on the floor and scott is slumped unconscious in chair
scotty
she dead jim just like the other one
stabbed over and over again
to scott drink this an argelian stimulant doctor quite effective and quite harmless
go ahead scotty
lieutenant captain where
lieutenant tracy is dead scott you were found alone in the room
dead but
what happened down there
was sitting there she was taking her readings and now sitting here
is that all that happened
tell you don remember must have passed out
it could be jim that head injury
that head injury think scotty
captain ve been trying can even believe this is really happening
there no way into that place from up here prefect is there another entrance to that chamber
yes there door that leads into the garden but it been locked for years
locks can be picked jim
check it mccoy leaves and hengist enters he is accompanied by the man from the next table and one of the musicians
prefect both of these men were at the cafe the night of the murder
where ve they been during the past few minutes
captain if you don mind please
there been another murder hengist one of my crew
the same as kara
why that terrible to the man from the next table you my men picked you up near there what were you doing
please know nothing about it didn kill anyone
well how was the girl killed
stabbed and there no sign of the weapon
if only had facilities
you you were musician at the cafe you played for the murdered girl
since she was little girl she danced for me she was my daughter prefect how could this thing have happened here the man who did it must be found he must be punished
and you you left the cafe before scott and kara
is this true who are you
morla of cantaba street prefect was there have nothing to hide
did you know kara
of course he knew her they were to be married but he behaved disgracefully unheard of he was jealous of her
that is very disquieting
know it was wrong but just couldn help myself loved her and when she went over to the table with these men could not stand to watch so left and went home
jealousy has often been motive for murder
yes know that is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved of here
prefect didn kill anyone couldn
we shall see morla
sorry jim the lock may or may not have been picked it would be hard to tell even with the tricorder
can you prove you went directly home
captain may continue with the questions please
well get on with it man just don stand there
captain captain you re behaving very much like man who is desperately trying anything to save his friend would you be as desperate to save argelius as space port for your starfleet
well of course trying to save my friend if he innocent and he hasn been proven guilty
need remind you of the circumstances captain in both cases your friend scott was discovered over the body and later claimed to remember nothing
am ready jaris
gentlemen sit down please everyone sits around the central brazier
on one condition prefect that the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on
he flicks row of switches and the doorways are closed the room is sealed
captain you mean my neck is going to have to depend on some spooky mumbo jumbo kirk communicator beeps
kirk here
yes excuse me gentlemen moves away from the group yes mister spock
concerning the situation you related to us in my opinion the argelian empathic contact is an interesting phenomenon but the technique is not sound enough to risk man life
what do you suggest mister spock
simply that we beam mister scott on board the enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth
these are proud people they have their own customs their own laws and while we re here we re subject to them it is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to argelian law is that clear
quite clear captain
don like it any more than you do spock but there nothing we can do about it kirk out everyone is holding hands around the brazier
let us begin let the circle not be broken concentrate upon the flame which burns upon the altar of truth yes there is something here something terrible feel its presence fear anger hatred anger feeds the flame oh oh there is evil here monstrous terrible evil consuming hunger hatred of all that lives hatred of women hunger that never dies it is strong overpowering an ancient terror it has name beratis kesla redjac devouring all life all light hunger that will never die redjac redjac the lights go out and she screams when the lights come on again the flame has gone out scott is standing holding sybo in his arms then he lets her go and she falls forward across mccoy lap there is knife in her back later
three murders and scotty the only possible answer each time
don care what the circumstances indicate jim scotty simply could not have done it
normally no but that blow on his head could
no captain kirk scotty sorry you don even remember whether you did it or not
agree with you captain perfectly satisfied mister scott is guilty
but not responsible
that is unproven sir
we can prove it if he insane
gentlemen please how could any man do such monstrous things
that what we hope to find out sir
mister scott
sir swear to you did not kill your wife or the other ladies
by your own admission you don know whether you did or didn your so-called failing memory
mister hengist on the enterprise we can make recording of the registrations of mister scott conscious and subconscious mind they will tell us what happened to him in the recent past
there would be no room for doubt we would know and after all that what we re after isn it prefect to know
you sir claim to remember nothing about the murders
aye
if this is so you may have killed without knowing it will your machines tell us this
no doubt will remain
very well we will go to your ship and he who is guilty will face the ancient penalties barbaric and horrible though they may be the ancient penalty for murder was death by slow torture that law has never been changed do you understand that mister scott
aye understand captain log stardate 3615 with mister scott in technical state of arrest we have beamed aboard the enterprise to continue the investigation
each testifier will sit here place his hand on this plate any deviation from factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer which will in turn notify us doctor mccoy has already fed the computer his medical reports our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis shall we begin jaris nods
mister scott will you take the stand scott sits on the raised chair and puts his right hand on the sensor plate yet at no time does the camera let us see all his finger
computer identify verification
working lieutenant commander montgomery scott serial number se-19754-t verified
subject present physical condition
working subject recently received severe blow on skull damage healing some peripheral abnormalities
sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia
working negative
captain don see how that can be
unless scotty lying about his loss of memory
not lying captain don remember thing about the first two murders
computer accuracy scan
subject relaying accurate account no physiological changes
captain didn black out when mister jaris wife was killed
all right scotty let have it
we were holding hands when the lights went out the circle was broken heard the poor lady scream and as was near the head of the table anyway went toward her but there was something in my way
something you mean someone
no captain some thing cold it was like stinking draught out of slaughterhouse but it wasn really there like it lost for words if you know what mean
computer
subject relaying accurate account no physiological changes
all right let hit it on the head scotty did you kill sybo
no captain that sure of
he been saying that right along it means no more now than it did before
scotty lie to me how old are you
twenty two sir
inaccurate inaccurate data in error
after the lights went out mister scott who was holding your hand
morla on the one side and you on the other sir
but that doesn mean anything captain with room that small the lights were out anyone would ve had time to kill the lady
but remind you we found mister scott holding her in his arms the knife still to jaris sorry sir but must the knife still in her back and blood on his hands
the verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn kill her
there were two other women murdered
mister scott did you kill kara
don remember
did you kill lieutenant tracy
don remember
computer accuracy scan
subject relaying accurate account no physiological changes
all that proves is that he telling the truth when he says he doesn remember
this is waste of time
after we take the testimony here we ll run psycho-tricorder analysis of mister scott memory which is what we wanted to do on the surface that will give us complete record will that satisfy you mister hengist
well if you can convince me that the machine is incapable of error and if it shows he did not kill the women
there will be no error as for the rest of it the readings will show you can step down mister scott if there are no objections
object to the entire procedure
mister hengist we are here on my authority we will co-operate
prefect know you mean well but ve had experience
for the time being we will accept captain kirk explanation of the machine accuracy as factual do however reserve to myself the right to make the final determination
we can ask no more mister morla will you take the stand he does so
where were you at the time that kara was murdered
not sure walking home assume was angry
anger is relative state sir were you angry enough to do violence
ve never done violence in my life don think could you ve got to believe me wouldn kill her couldn loved her and she loved me
that not true he might think she loved him but she didn she told me he was jealous all the time they fought constantly
did you kill lieutenant tracy
no
did you kill sybo
no
computer verification scan
subject relaying accurate account though some statements subjective no physiological changes
all right mister morla think you can step down now sybo spoke of hunger that never dies something that thrives on fear terror death mister spock maybe we re going about it in the wrong way let assume that sybo was sensitive that she did sense something something evil
sensitivity of certain argelian women is documented fact captain
my poor sybo talent was genuine gentlemen what she told you was true
all right then what was it she said exactly monstrous evil ancient terror
that devours all life and light
she said something else words that didn make sense
yes redjac beratis and er kesla
obscure meaningless words
to us perhaps but to the computer
ah mister spock check them out
computer linguistic bank definition of following word redjac
working negative finding
there is no such word in the linguistics bank
affirmative
scan all other banks
working affirmative proper name
define
redjac source earth nineteenth century language english nickname for mass murderer of women other earth synonym jack the ripper
jack the ripper
that ridiculous he lived hundreds of years ago
man couldn survive all these centuries
just before she died my wife said it is hunger that never dies
but all men die
yes all men die and jack the ripper couldn be alive if he were man but everything we ve uncovered points to jack the ripper which is an impossibility isn it or is it
humans and humanoids make up only small percentage of the life forms we know of there are entities possessed of extremely long life spans virtually immortal
we know that someone or something killed three women if it impossible for it to be human it has to be something else something driven to kill
sybo said it feeds on death
in the strict scientific sense doctor we all feed on death even vegetarians
yes but she said more than that not just death but fear she said it also feeds on fear
which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions
surely prefect this has gone far enough someone some man has killed three women we have the prime suspect in our hands are we going to let him go and start chasing ghosts
no mister hengist not ghosts possibly not human but not ghosts mister spock check out the possibilities
computer digest log recordings for past five solar minutes correlate hypotheses compare with life forms register question could such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy
the drella of alpha carinae five derives nourishment from the emotion of love there is sufficient precedent for existence of creature nature unknown which could exist on emotion of fear
computer extrapolate most likely composition of such entity
working to meet with specified requirements entity would exist without form in conventional sense most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field
computer could the described entity assume physical form
affirmative precedent mellitus cloud creature of alpha majoris one
fairy tales ghosts and goblins
no ve seen the mellitus myself in its natural state it gaseous when it at rest it solid mister spock let assume the existence of this creature
point out that jack the ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old earth and was never identified
doesn seem likely does it
suggest the possibility of hypnotic screen which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer
is that possible
extremely possible there are many such examples that exist in nature
this is fantasy we all know the murderer is sitting right here you re trying to cloud the issue ve got mind to
am satisfied the course of this investigation is valid enough please be seated mister hengist
all right mister spock what do we have creature without form that feeds on horror and fear that must assume physical shape to kill
and suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified generating more sheer horror than the male of the species
computer criminological files cases of unsolved mass murders of women since jack the ripper
working 1932 shanghai china earth seven women knifed to death 1974 kiev ussr earth five women knifed to death 2105 martian colonies eight women knifed to death 2156 heliopolis alpha eridani two ten women knifed to death there are additional examples
captain those places are aligned directly between argelius and earth
yes when man moved out into the galaxy that thing must ve moved with him computer identify the proper names kesla and beratis
working kesla name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet deneb two beratis name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet rigel four additional data murders on rigel four occurred one solar year ago all heads turn towards mister hengist
you come from rigel four
well many people do it not crime
no but what we re investigating is would you mind taking the stand mister hengist
will not
mister hengist
prefect this has gone far enough will not take the stand
can appreciate your position sir you are in charge of civil disturbances locally if you are the entity for which we search what better position from which to kill with impunity
just after you left jaris house we discovered the murder knife was missing
and you were unaccounted for when lieutenant tracy was murdered
an entity which feeds on fear and terror would find perfect hunting ground on argelius planet without violence where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep the entity would be as hungry wolf in that fold
gentlemen know something of the law you re engaging in sheer speculation
perhaps mister spock the murder weapon
computer report on analysis of exhibit
working exhibit on visual composition of blade boridium composition of handle murinite details of carving on handle conform to folk art forms indicating place of origin
specify point of origin
artefact produced by hill people of argus river region planet rigel four
now then mister hengist but hengist tries to make break for it even landing very good kick on kirk who repays him with an even better right cross hengist falls to the floor
he dead jim
but that impossible the lights dim eerily the lights come back
the computer will not respond to these controls the entity is unquestionably controlling it
and the computer controls the ship
scotty give me hand they prop hengist up on chair leaning against the table
it no use captain the bypass circuits are blocked
audio cut off spock
captain the viewscreen has an image of hot swirling flames or lava anyway it is fear-inducing
lady yeoman what happening captain
what does it mean
it means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship including the life support systems
you mean it could kill us all
indeed it will try but not immediately we know it feeds on fear and terror there are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills
all hands this is the captain stay at your posts remain calm captain out bones what the sedative situation
ve got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano
good start distribution immediately the longer we can hold back that fear the more time we ll have to get that thing out of the computer prefect you ll all be safer here spock come with me
spock don you have compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks
yes we do captain but with the entity in control
aren there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved
indeed if we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them
that ought to do it
spock the door nearly closes before he is inside
apparently our friends learned very quickly
too quickly bridge but the lights indicate they are going down quickly not up
freefall
out of control put it on manual bridge they start going up then an alarm goes off
that was due to be next life-support malfunction
we don have much time captain
you said it yourself spock it wants terror not just death
captain the life-support system override jammed
all right man your station mister sulu
aye sir
cut that thing off
try and cut that thing off
this is the first time heard malfunction threaten us
man your post mister sulu to all the crew prepare your manual overrides you may need them
aye sir kirk crouches down by spock under the life-support station
spock
normal environmental levels have been restored captain but it will not last long few hours at best
that should be enough time let get at it
what going on captain
never mind mister sulu nurse enters
tranquilliser
yes sir
everyone including yourself
yes sir
you cannot stop me now captain it will do you no good control all circuits you cannot silence me you cannot reach me your manual overrides are extremely limited in life
spock
proceeding captain but will need some time
yes know you can do to prevent it
if you destroy this ship you destroy yourself and shall live beyond its end in the meantime shall feed and this time do not need knife you will all die horribly in searing pain
it is attempting to generate terror captain
captain gets his injection and grins who ever he is he sure talks gloomy
man your post mister if any of the other systems go out switch to manual override and above all don be afraid
with an armful of this stuff wouldn be afraid of supernova
ready
implement
computer this is class compulsory directive compute to the last digit the value of pi
as we know the value of pi is transcendental figure without resolution the computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop
yes that should keep that thing busy for while the argelians will be the first to panic let get back to the briefing room
wonder who it is we re not supposed to be afraid of mccoy is in the process of inoculating the group scott feels no pain that for sure
well sir
doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than group of figures for while
there is resistance captain but the directive is succeeding bank after bank is turning to the problem
if you drive it out of the computers it ll have to go somewhere else
how are you doing
almost finished just jaris and me maniacal laughter over the intercom
complete computer control captain the entity has fled
yes but where to bones what would happen if that thing entered tranquillised body
well it might take up knitting but nothing more violent than that
you say everyone had shot but you and jaris
and you and mister spock captain
well willing to take chance on mister spock better give yourself shot doc
no don think so think ought to stay clear
do as say mccoy injects himself
extend your arm mister jaris
grabs kirk throat no no kill you all die make you suffer spock administers neck-pinch hengist comes back to life snatches up the knife and grabs yeoman tankris
everybody keep back or ll kill her ll kill her keep back
you better be careful you re going to hurt somebody with that thing hengist pushes his hostage at mccoy then tries to attack kirk he easily defeated
you ll suffer you ll suffer spock injects him ll kill all of you
let get him to the transporter room quick
you ll die die die everybody will die kirk carries the giggling hengist in fireman lift while spock follows
kill kill kill you all
deep space full power widest angle of dispersion maintain
no need to get excited captain ll do it they lay hengist on the pad
you do it spock
everybody die you ll all suffer he is beamed out
you didn have to shove me mister spock have gotten round to it mccoy and scott enter with big grins
well jaris is all right
what did you do with that thing captain did you send it back to the planet
no we beamed it out into open space scotty widest possible dispersion
that thing can die
possibly doctor its consciousness may continue for some time consisting of billions of separate bits of energy floating forever in space powerless
but it will die finally you seem very happy about the whole thing
why not for while there didn know whether was innocent or guilty
bones how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off
don know five or six hours gave them pretty big shot jim
yes can see that well mister spock for the next five or six hours we re going to have the happiest crew in space of course we won get much work done
captain since you came to argelius to rest suggest you take advantage of the opportunity
that splendid idea mister spock know cafe where the women are so
know the place jim
let go see
you gentlemen in your condition don be ridiculous mister spock this cafe has women that are so met with look no guess not alone kirk goes to the door and gestures for everyone to leave
gentlemen everyone on the bridge is staring at spock back as he analyses some sensor data
no doubt about it captain the space debris comes from the survey vessel ss beagle
missing for six years and now this junk in space
portions of the antimatter nacelles personal belongings captain no signs of bodies whatsoever
then whatever destroyed the ship the crew was able to get off safely navigator compute the present drift of the wreckage
computed and on the board sir
mister spock assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years
it would have come from planet four star system eight nine two directly ahead
only one sixteenth parsec away captain we should be there in seconds
standard orbit around the planet there may be survivors there
ss beagle small class four stardrive vessel crew of forty seven commanded by jim believe you knew him captain merik
yes at the academy he was dropped in his fifth year he went into the merchant service
coming up on the planet captain planet with lots of water some land masses and just few wispy white clouds
put it on the screen
definitely class somewhat similar to earth
yes similar but the land masses and oceans are quite different however
different in shape only captain the proportion of land to water is exactly as on your earth density five point five diameter seven nine one seven at the equator atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen twenty one percent oxygen again exactly like earth
exactly in some ways different in others
also picked up indications of large cities
what era
no sign of atomic power as yet but far enough along for radio communications power transportation an excellent road system
captain both amplitude and frequency modulation being used think can pick up something visual it news broadcast using system think they once called video
television was the colloquial term
put it on the screen
aye black and white image of people watching as police in crash helmets arrest someone there is car in the foreground very 1950s or 60s authorities are as yet unable to explain these fresh outbreaks of treasonable disobedience by well-treated well-protected intelligent slaves now turning to the world of sports and bringing you the taped results of the arena games last night sword fight the first heat involved amateurs they re petty thieves from city prison conducted however with traditional weapons it provided some amusement for few moments in the second heat slightly more professional display in the spirit of our splendid past when gladiator claudius marcus killed the last of the barbarians william harrison in an excellent example of the picture of an old roman fight with net and short sword is lost
transmission lost sir shall try to get it back
slaves and gladiators what are we seeing twentieth-century rome
captain the one described as the barbarian is also listed here flight officer william harrison of the ss beagle at least there were some survivors down there
ready the transporter room mister spock we re beaming down the landing party of three is beamed onto ridge nicely silhouetted against the clear blue sky
you could have selected more convenient place mister spock
but hardly more practical captain close to the city we located but not populated we should not be observed they head down the steep slope spock takes some tricorder scans
fascinating this atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons
the word was smog
yes believe that was the term had no idea you were that much of historian doctor
am not mister spock was simply trying to stop you from giving us whole lecture on the subject jim is there anything at all we know about this planet
the ss beagle was the first ship to make survey of this star sector when it disappeared
then the prime directive is in full force captain
no identification of self or mission no interference with the social development of said planet
no references to space or the fact that there are other worlds or more advanced civilisations
let go
one just once like to be able to land someplace and say behold am the archangel gabriel
fail to see the humour in that situation doctor
naturally you could hardly claim to be an angel with those pointed ears mister spock but say you landed someplace with pitchfork gunshot rings out
complete earth parallel the language here is english kirk tries to go for his phaser and another shot hits the ground near his feet
think he means it spock
there would seem to be evidence to that effect four men appear from behind rocks they are wearing t-shirts with short chain motif at the neck the leader is barefoot and wearing shorts
who are you
we come from another province
to spock where are you from what do you call those
call them ears
are you trying to be funny
never colloquial twentieth-century english an amazing parallel
we come from place that quite some journey from here doubt if you ve heard
uniforms probably some new praetorian guard unit should kill you here but septimus would probably be displeased move move as they are lead along guard whistles the signal that they are approaching and two men come out of hidden cave
didn harm them septimus as much as wanted to
very old man with gentle way of speaking keep always in your mind flavius that our way is peace
for which we are grateful for we are men of peace ourselves
oh are you children of the sun
well if you re speaking of worships of sorts we represent many beliefs
there is only one true belief roman butchers sent here by the first citizen
do we look like any romans you ever saw
then are you slaves like ourselves
our people don believe in slavery
roman lie we must kill them
sir we came here looking for some friends forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago they wore clothing similar to ours have you heard of such men
septimus know killing is evil but sometimes it necessary
no
but they ve located us our hiding place it better to kill few of them than all of us
wait can prove we re telling the truth small device ll take it out slowly his communicator kirk to enterprise come in
scotty lock in on my transmission beam scan us
including ourselves how many of us are there
good scotty continue scanning we ll maintain transmission kirk out the enterprise is our ship somewhere at sea that all can tell you if it isn sufficient you will have to kill us
tell me the empire has device like that flavius and you may kill them otherwise accept them as friends septimus leads the way into the caves captain log stardate 4040 on the surface of planet four system eight nine two the landing party has won the confidence of what obviously is group of runaway slaves they dwell in caves not far from large city wear rags live under primitive conditions but they are creatures of heavily industrialised twentieth-century type planet very much like earth an amazing example of hodgkins law of parallel planet development but on this earth rome never fell world ruled by emperors who can trace their line back two thousand years to their own julius and augustus caesars the landing party are given water and spock leafs through some magazines
no captain sure would have heard of the arrival of other men like you
perhaps you ve heard let say an impossible story or rumour of men who came from the sky or from other worlds
there are no other worlds
the stars
lights shining through from heaven it is where the sun is blessed be the sun
yes of course
brings over magazine captain thought you might find this interesting
spock
fascinating
looking at car advert the jupiter eight conventional internal combustion engine you were right about the smog but the jupiter eight mars toothpaste neptune bath salts
taken from the names of false gods when was senator worshiped them too but heard the words of the sun became brother for that they made me slave
septimus we need your help we must go into the city we know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently
my advice to you is to leave go back where you came from
we can do that perhaps you know his name merik captain merik general consternation and animosity from the other slaves
merikus
yes he the leader of our friends
merikus is first citizen butcher
that doesn sound like the same man
captain logical question if may septimus how many years ago did merikus become your first citizen
perhaps five years
almost six was there when he became lord of the games if he is your friend you are no friends of ours
septimus wherever we may be from you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others if captain merik is merikus then he has violated that law and he must be taken away and punished will you help us get to the truth of all this
first must discuss it with the others the men leave
curious captain the similarity in names were you told why merik was dropped from the space academy
he failed psycho-simulator test all it takes is split second of indecision hardly the type to become political strongman
odd that these people should worship the sun
why doctor
because my dear mister spock it is illogical rome had no sun worshipers why should they parallel rome in every way except one the men return
we have decided flavius will guide you we will provide you with suitable clothing caution you take great care the police are everywhere may the blessings of the sun be upon you dressed as slaves in jeans and t-shirts the landing party are lead towards the city spock wears his obligatory woollen hat they stop by small thicket of trees
we ll wait here until dark
are you slave flavius
you are barbarians indeed not to know of flavius maximus for seven years was the most successful gladiator in this province
then you heard the word of the sun
yes the words of peace and freedom it wasn easy for me to believe was trained to fight but the words the words are true
there are many things like to know he interrupted by rapid gunfire
hold don move hands in the air armed police round them up four fleeing fish fine haul flavius maximus flavius attacks him and gets knocked down
you have been too long absent from the games flavius the first citizen will be pleased runaway slaves are always welcome removes spock hat no not slaves barbarians it been long time since ve watched barbarians die in the arena captain log stardate 4040 uniformed police like those of earth great city like rome with automobiles astonishing similarities to twentieth-century earth down to the fine carbon steel in the bars spock and mccoy carry flavius into cell
tell merikus like to see him
the first citizen why would he bother with arena bait like you
tell him it jim kirk perhaps friend
perhaps
well if am friend and you don tell him do you really want to risk that they are locked in and left alone mccoy tends to flavius head wound
but if there have been slaves for over 000 years hasn there always been discontent runaways
long ago there were rebellions but they were suppressed and with each century the slaves acquired more rights under the law they received rights to medicine the right to government payments in their old age and they slowly learned to be content
even more fascinating slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments old-age pensions
quite logical say mister spock just as it logical that twentieth-century rome would use television to show its gladiator contests or name new car the jupiter eight
doctor if were able to show emotion your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me
what term logic medical men are trained in logic mister spock
really doctor had no idea they were trained watching you assumed it was trial and error
are they enemies captain
not sure they re sure when the slaves began to worship the sun they became discontent again when did all this happen
long ago perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire the message of the sun that all men are brothers was kept from us perhaps fool to believe it it does often seem that man must fight to live
you go on believing it flavius all men are brothers the guards return
flavius your friends are waiting for you you ve already been matched for the morning games come
will not fight brother of the sun
put sword in your hand and you ll fight know you flavius you re as peaceful as bull two guards take flavius away
you three come with us
three against three we may never get better chance
no talking outside
looking at mccoy doubt if he ll get very far he feels ill
do
outside
all right but he ll double over before we get very far spock and kirk take mccoy arms
no think can walk ll try mccoy suddenly doubles over in pain and two guards are sent in to help one gets neck-pinched the roman is karate-chopped and the last guard is punched by the invalid
let go
blue eyed red haired well done jim armed guards appear afraid it isn that easy they ve been handling slaves here for two thousand years
but it was exciting they do well in the arena
captain merik isn it
yes it me this is our proconsul claudius marcus
but this is no place for reunion
this way your friends too there lots to talk about lots to explain
agree
don judge me before you know the facts come on we can talk freely here the proconsul knows who and what we are some small animal skins on the floor brass brazier an urn and busts on plinths and girl preparing drinks
you can leave us the guards leave
well celebration meeting of old friends
prepare food for our friends they ve come from great distance great distance indeed so this is vulcan interesting from what ve heard wish had fifty of you for the arena
this other is your ship surgeon
mccoy
it pity we can let him loose in our hospitals our level of medicine would improve immeasurably sure
come you must be hungry gentlemen they sit at table and the girl brings over plate
oh try the sparrow broiled in garum delicious or perhaps some of this roast kid lovely thing isn she
all right what happened
we had meteor damage jim went ashore with landing party to look for iridium ore for repairs and met this gentleman
go on
he convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word of their existence elsewhere
contamination can risk that oh you ll understand as you learn more about us
so made the decision to stay
what happened to your crew did they voluntarily beam come ashore
this is an ordered world jim conservative world based on time-honoured roman strengths and virtues
what happened to your crew
there been no war here for over four hundred years jim could let say your land of that same era make that same boast think you can see why they don want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places
interesting and given conservative empire quite understandable
are you out of your head
said understood it doctor find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating
next he ll be telling us he prefers it over earth history
they do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars doctor
they have slavery gladiatorial games despotism
situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war the eleven million who died in your second the thirty seven million who died in your third shall go on
interesting and you captain which world do you prefer
my world proconsul is my vessel my oath my crew what happened to your vessel you ve explained what happened to your oath is obvious
and as for my men those that were able to adapt to this world are still alive those who couldn adapt are dead that the way it is with life everywhere isn it
you sent your own men into the arena
just as did jim you re going to order your own people ashore
you must know that impossible starfleet regulations
are designed to circumvent any such order there may be over four hundred men on your ship captain but they can be brought down if it handled properly say few at time you see have the advantage of trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible your communicator captain kirk now do save us all lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders
they re going to be arriving soon anyway jim recon party then rescue party then another rescue party had less men it added up the same
do you really believe could be made to order my own people down
believe this captain that you would do almost anything rather than see these two dear friends put slowly to death kirk takes the communicator
jim
kirk to enterprise armed guards enter
scotty if you have fix guns are pointed at his head stand by scotty
very wise of you captain no point in sending up bullet-ridden corpses
yet on the other hand my chief engineer standing by for message
do hope so for your sake now captain what are you going to order your men to do
if brought down hundred of them armed with phasers
you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire and violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies believe you all swear you ll die before you violate that directive am right
quite correct
must you always be so blasted honest
but on the other hand why even bother to send your men down from what understand your vessel could lay waste to the entire surface of the world oh but there that prime directive in the way again can interfere
jim you ve already started message your engineer waiting what are you going to do
scotty sorry to keep you waiting overdue
order your officers to come down
condition green all well kirk out
guards take them prepare them for the games
ah that was stupid jim this is not an academy training test this is for real they re taking you to die ship log stardate 4041 chief engineer scott recording captain kirk and his landing party have checked in
but they have used the code term condition green which means they re in trouble but it also prohibits my taking any action ends log entry mister chekov pinpoint power source locations type power load factors and how much our beams will have to pull to overload them
that may take some time
let it take time lad they re in trouble and under orders not to interfere however no order can stop me from frightening them it may do no good but it may suggest to someone just what starship can really do aye actually painted backdrop in the empire tv television studio the commentator sits on scaffolding next to camera operator
good evening ladies and gentlemen live and direct from city arena and in colour we bring you name the winner brought to you tonight by your jupiter eight dealers from coast to coast in just moment tonight first heat we re in taped commercial proconsul forty seconds then we ll be back live claudius merik and kirk take seats on raised platform kirk is manacled and there are two armed guards behind him spock and mccoy are brought out by two guards in full traditional dress
stand by ten seconds and first tonight ladies and gentlemen surprise extra in the far corner pair of highly aggressive barbarians strong intelligent with strange ways and sure full of lot of surprises and facing them two favorites here from previous encounters achilles and flavius the canned applause is turned up by bored sound effects man victory or death and for which of them well ladies and gentlemen you know as much about that at this moment as do because this is your programme you name the winner
don mind fighting but why you achilles takes on spock they are well matched mccoy is against flavius and doesn know what to do with short sword
flavius may be getting off to slow start but he never disappointed this crowd close one the barbarian with the pointed ears seems to be in trouble
tell you well able to defeat you
fight barbarian
most of my men went the same way hoped would feel it less with yours
do not want to injure you the cat-calls and hisses are amplified flavius gets taste of the whip
fight you two you bring this network ratings down flavius and we ll do special on you mccoy puts more effort into it
question captain
the rules if spock should finish his man off first would he be able to help
we believe men should fight their own battles only the weak will die my word as roman ready to order your men down captain
maybe now you understand why gave in the romans have always been the strongest and they ve had practice for over two thousand years in enslaving men using them killing them
quite true captain kirk the games have always strengthened us death becomes familiar pattern we don fear it as you do flavius gets whipped again
at least defend yourself
am defending myself
not like that you fool hold your weapon higher the cat-calls are replaced by cheers
admit it you find these games frightening revolting
proconsul in some parts of the galaxy have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like folk dance
certain this isn different captain those are your men dying not strangers
ve had to select men to die before so that others could be saved
you re clever liar captain kirk merikus was spaceship captain ve observed him thoroughly your species has no such strength
he commands not just spaceship proconsul but starship very special vessel and crew tried for such command
see no evidence of superiority they fight no better than your men did merikus perhaps not as well
stop running fight
need any help doctor
whatever gave you that idea
fight you pointed-ear freak
you tell him buster of all the completely ridiculous illogical questions ever heard in my life mccoy falls and is vulnerable achilles is distracted so spock punches him out then goes and neck-pinches flavius
clear foul proconsul your decision
your opinion merikus after all they re like yourself
it your decision proconsul
your opinion captain kirk would you like me to kill them now an easy death then you gladly accept whatever happens to you take them back to their cage well it won go that easily for them captain nor for you take him to my quarters kirk is alone in the room and is startled when curtain is pulled back and the blonde girl appears wearing very little
was told to wait for you and provide wine food whatever you wish am proconsul slave drusilla although for this evening pause for this evening was told am your slave command me
it won work
what will not work
whatever he has in mind whatever tricks you hear that proconsul it won work not co-operating may die but you won get any entertainment out of it
we re alone please believe me ve never lied to one who owns me spock is checking the iron bars of their prison
angry mister spock or frustrated perhaps
such emotions are foreign to me doctor merely testing the strength of the door
for the fifteenth time spock spock know we ve had our disagreements maybe they re jokes don know as jim says we re not often sure ourselves sometimes but what trying to say is
doctor am seeking means of escape will you please be brief
well what trying to say is you saved my life in the arena
yes that quite true
trying to thank you you pointed-eared hobgoblin
oh yes you humans have that emotional need to express gratitude you re welcome believe is the correct response however doctor you must remember am entirely motivated by logic the loss of our ship surgeon whatever think of his skill would mean reduction in the efficiency of the enterprise and therefore
do you know why you re not afraid to die spock you re more afraid of living each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out that it isn it insecurity why you wouldn know what to do with genuine warm decent feeling
really doctor
know worried about jim too the wine is being poured
very good he tries grape excellent
was concerned am ordered to please you
ve been in some strange worlds with strange customs perhaps this is considered torture here
torture do not understand do not wish to see you tortured in any way she kisses him at the first sign of pain you will tell me
you ll be the first to know later when the oil lamp has burnt out and kirk is asleep
captain kirk wakes with start sorry was detained should we have our little talk now so far on this planet we ve kept you rather busy don wonder you slept through the afternoon by the way one of the communicators we took from you is missing was it my pretty drusilla by any chance merik enters there are guards in the room now too
see if he has it not that would have punished her would have blamed you you re roman kirk or you should have been it not on his person
no proconsul
am sorry was detained trust there was nothing further you required
nothing except perhaps an explanation
because you re man owe you that you must die shortly and because you are man pauses would you leave us merik the thoughts of one man to another cannot possibly interest you merik leaves
because you are man gave you some last hours as man
appreciate that
unfortunately we must demonstrate that defiance is intolerable
of course
but ve learned to respect you promise you you will die easily quickly
thank you and my friends
when their time comes the same of course guards take him to the arena oh we ve pre-empted fifteen minutes on the early show for you in full colour we guarantee you splendid audience you may not understand because you re centuries beyond anything as crude as television
ve heard it was similar enterprise log engineer scott reporting all banks in readiness for disruption of power sources on the planet surface
good evening ladies and gentlemen before tonight first heat simple execution stay tuned to this channel there lot of excitement coming your way
make it quick single thrust
don move you ll only die harder
rushing into the arena murderers if you want death fight me claudius signals guard who fires his machine gun the roman is killed along with flavius kirk grabs the sword and deals with another roman
now mister chekov activate as the lights go out kirk gets himself gun and runs
guards don let him escape guards when the lights come on again he by mccoy and spock cell
jim
stand back he shoots the lock out
obsolete but effective
what happened jim
what did they do to you
they threw me few curves no time to explain claudius and guards come in from two different entrances
hold we re in each other line of fire pity you captain merik but at least watch and see how men die swords only so the fight starts and spock acquires sword very quickly the cell door is defensible position
into communicator starship lock in on this three to beam claudius stabs him but merik manages to throw the communicator into the cell with the landing party they disappear in hail of bullets captain log stardate 4041 note commendation engineering officer scott despite enormous temptation
and strong personal feelings he obeyed the prime directive his temporary blackout of the city below resulted in no interference with the society and yet saved the lives of myself and the landing party
thank you captain scott leaves as mccoy and spock enter the bridge
gentlemen
captain see on your report flavius was killed am sorry liked that huge sun worshiper
wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely it seems illogical for sun worshiper to develop philosophy of total brotherhood sun worship is usually primitive superstition religion
afraid you have it all wrong mister spock all of you ve been monitoring some of their old-style radio waves the empire spokesman trying to ridicule their religion but he couldn don you understand it not the sun up in the sky it the son of god
caesar and christ they had them both and the word is spreading only now
philosophy of total love and total brotherhood
it will replace their imperial rome but it will happen in their twentieth century
wouldn it be something to watch to be part of to see it happen all over again mister chekov take us out of orbit ahead warp factor one
aye sir landing party of kirk spock mccoy yeoman thompson and security guard have just beamed down
no life form readings captain continuing scan
well somebody sent distress call
no sign of the spaceship no sign of debris
am getting readings on small metallic objects captain it is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in shuttle craft
but where are they
captain getting reading now two human forms at bearing three hundred mark seven
confirmed male in an orange suit and female in blue outfit approach the party
captain james kirk of the starship enterprise we came in answer to your distress call
it was very kind of you to respond so quickly captain now you will surrender your ship to me
you have very strange sense of humour mister the man presses button on his belt and kirk spock and mccoy are immobilised the woman does the same to the yeoman and guard
am rojan of kelva am your commander from this moment on any efforts to resist us or to escape will be severely punished soon we and you will leave this galaxy forever you humans must face the end of your existence as you have known it you are all paralyzed by selective field that neutralises nerve impulses to the voluntary muscles we can control you at will will now release you
stay there
captain
it all right
interesting neural field
yes radiating from central projector
what do you want
your ship captain kirk it will serve us well in the long voyage that is to come
voyage where
to your neighbouring galaxy which you call andromeda
andromeda why
it is our home
what brings you here
within ten millennia high radiation levels in our galaxy will make life there impossible so the kelvan empire sent forth ships to explore other galaxies to search for one which our race could conquer and occupy
well sorry this galaxy is already occupied
captain you think you are unconquerable and your ship impregnable but while we ve talked the capture has already begun
something penetrating from the planet
increase power to shields another male in purple jumpsuit appears in engineering and immobilises the crew there
it dead sir all major power disabled
sound red alert
red alert all personnel man your battle stations go to red alert woman in mustard coloured outfit takes over life support
engineering come in
life support come in then man in brown immobilises the bridge crew
drea tomar report
life support control secure
engineering is secure
rojan hanar here
report hanar life support systems
proceed with your orders
what the point of capturing my ship even at maximum warp the enterprise couldn get to andromeda galaxy for thousands of years
captain we will modify its engines in order to produce velocities far beyond the reach of your science the journey between galaxies will take less than three hundred of your years spock fascinating intergalactic travel requiring only three hundred years that is leap far beyond anything man has yet accomplished
you made voyage of three hundred years
our ships were of multigeneration design we were born in the intergalactic void we shall die there during our return journey
and our mission will be completed by commander who is my descendant
what happened to your ship
there is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy
yes know we ve been there
we managed to break through it with great difficulty our ship was destroyed we barely managed to escape in lifecraft and now we have the means to begin our journey back to andromeda
why use our vessel why not transmit message to your galaxy
no form of transmission can penetrate the barrier
rojan there no reason to do this by force let take your problem to the federation research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization
we do not colonize we conquer we rule there no other way for us
in other words the galaxy isn big enough for both of us
the federation has handled foreign invasions before
captain we can control the federation as easily as we can control you the fate of the inferior in any galaxy hanar suddenly appears on the planet
all is proceeding according to plan rojan
kelinda take them to the holding area we ll keep you and your party here captain your crew will undoubtedly wish to co-operate with us if they understand that you are hostages
move there
tomar has examined the ship the modifications are underway
space again hanar do not think we could have kept our sanity living too long on this accursed planet
it is an undisciplined environment one cannot control it yet there are things of interest
yes but disturbing these shells in which we ve encased ourselves they have such heightened senses to feel to hear to smell how do humans manage to exist in these fragile cases
since the ship was designed to sustain these forms we have little choice
at least we ll be away from all of this openness this is too strange for us hanar we are creatures of outer space and soon we will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls rock walls with metal bars across the door
fascinating material similar to diburnium but considerably more dense doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure
all right we can break out there must be another way
captain what do they want from us what kind of people are they
that very good question
they registered as human
no doctor more than that they registered as perfect human life forms recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses most curious
spock what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy
the chances are very much against it
captain kalinda has appeared so they move away from the door captain however perfect they are there don seem to be very many of them why
they have the paralysis field rojan mentioned something about central projector
yes if we could put that out of operation we might have chance
gentlemen constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like
those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field
possible would have to have one to examine
you ll have one sir if have to rip one of the kelvans apart to get it for you
you ll get your chance but you ll do it under orders
yes sir
on eminiar seven you were able to trick the guard by vulcan mind probe
yes recall captain led him to believe we had escaped
do you think you can do it again
shall attempt it kelinda seems to be getting nervous as spock makes his attempt then he is suddenly thrown across the cell they go to his aid kelinda enters and kirk grabs her and knocks her out he takes the belt device
are you all right
yes will be all right captain we must hurry but as they come running out of their cell rojan and hanar immobilise them kelinda walks over and is given her device back
releasing kirk this cannot go unpunished hanar that one the guard take him aside kelinda the female
captain
go as leader you realize the importance of discipline need you and these other specialists but those two are unnecessary
responsible let them go
think we re somewhat alike captain each of us cares less for his own safety than for the lives of his command we feel pain when others suffer for our mistakes your punishment shall be to watch them die captain proceed hanar the guard and the yeoman are reduced to blocks of solid matter
bring them to me this is the essence of what they were the flesh and brain and what you call the personality distilled down into these compact shapes and once crushed he demonstrates this person is dead however that one can be restored throws it on the ground hanar the security guard reappears captain log stardate 4657 work is proceeding on the enterprise as my crew is forced to make the required changes in the ship for intergalactic travel can forget the picture of yeoman thompson crushed to handful of dust
spock are you sure you re all right
yes quite all right doctor
you didn look very well when you broke that mind touch
did not break it doctor was thrown away by something ve never experienced before
what was it
series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness colours shapes mathematical equations fused and blurred ve been attempting to isolate them but so far ve been able to recall clearly only one immense beings hundred limbs which resemble tentacles minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing different function
do you mean that what the kelvans really are
undoubtedly
well if they look that way normally why did they adapt themselves to our bodies
perhaps practicality they chose the enterprise as the best vessel for the trip immense beings with hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift we ve got to stop them we outnumber them their only hold on us is the paralysis field
well that enough one wrong move and they jam all our neural circuits
jam spock if you reverse the circuits on mccoy neuro-analyser can you set up counter field to jam the paralysis projector
dubious of the possibilities of success captain the medical equipment is not designed to put out great deal of power the polarized elements would burn out quickly
is there chance at all
small one
we ll take it you and bones have to get to the ship
how
yes mister spock you re sick
assure you captain am in perfect health
no you re not doctor mccoy has given you an thorough examination and you re ill in fact if you don get to the sickbay you re going to die
it good idea jim but anyone looking at him can tell he healthy
vulcans have the ability to place themselves in kind of trance complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body
we find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation
can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay say in half an hour
it will take me moment to prepare
go ahead spock touches his forehead straightens up then falls gently into mccoy and kirk arms
jim his heartbeat really is slow his pulse is practically non-existent
goes to the door hanar hanar
what do you want human
mister spock is ill the doctor thinks he may be dying
this illness came on him rather suddenly is it not unusual
he vulcan they don react like humans
he may die if can get him up to sickbay there chance he ll live
stand away from the door enters the cell for closer look will have you beamed aboard
do what you can with him bones mccoy and tomar wheel spock in on trolley
doctor what happened
prepare two ccs of stokaline
stokaline but doctor that
don argue nurse just get it injects spock this may be the turning point prepare another shot
but doctor
please nurse just follow orders will you spock opens his eyes then shuts them again before she returns with the hypo mccoy gives another injection as tomar watches from little distance
there that should do it just let him rest now to tomar you see it flare-up of rigelian kassaba fever he suffered from it about ten years ago and it recurs every now and then there no danger if he gets medication in time he ll be all right in couple of hours
very well will inform rojan you will stay here
what do you want from me now
we will beam aboard the vessel shortly wish you to understand your duties
my duty is to stop you in any way can
you will obey
or you will kill more of my people
captain kirk cannot believe that you do not understand the importance of my mission we kelvans have code of honour harsh demanding it calls for much from us and much from those whom we conquer you have been conquered respect your devotion to your duty but cannot permit it to interfere with mine
picking flower and smelling it these are lovely captain kirk what is it you call them
flowers don know the variety
our memory tapes tell us of such things on kelvan crystals that form with such rapidity they seem to grow they look like this fragile thing somewhat we call them sahsheer
rose by any other name
captain
quote from great human poet shakespeare that which we call rose by any other name would smell as sweet
drea has computed and laid course for kelva captain
we ve jumped to warp eight
and we ll go faster yet increase speed to warp eleven
increase speed to warp eleven mister chekov
on course and proceeding as planned we will approach the barrier within an hour
very well
rojan going to sickbay my first officer was taken ill
yes was informed you may go
anything
ve located their power source captain it installed in engineering
we re just going to jam it
ve tied in all the lab computers that will give it bit more power to push with scott and spock are in the upper gallery while kirk is apparently talking to tomar below in main engineering there is rounded metal object on the console
this is it now all we have to do
whatever it is we must do it is impossible
why
this material surrounding the projector is the same as discovered on the planet readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons we cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine
that it then
there is one other possibility mister scott the final decision of course must be the captain but believe we must have it ready for him the enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors the barrier we must traverse is negative energy
see what you re getting at can say like it
nor but it must be made available to the captain spock and scott meet up with kirk
well
impossible captain the power source is protected by material we cannot breach even with our phasers mister scott and have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us
what alternative
the barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy
have opened the control valves to the matter-anti-matter nacelles on your signal will flood them with positive energy
what
when we engage the barrier the ship will explode the kelvans will be stopped here
and so will we
are you mad can just the turbolift arrives
take your places gentlemen we re approaching the barrier kirk takes the captain chair spock and scott their consoles as the barrier approaches scott finger is poised over flashing button captain log stardate 4658 with the enterprise under control of the kelvans we are approaching the energy barrier at the edge of our galaxy spock and scotty have devised suicide plan to stop the kelvans they have rigged the ship to explode on my signal
reading spock
sensors indicate density negative radiation negative energy negative kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision all instruments off the dials captain we are in contact with the barrier
outside hull temperatures rising sir it over two thousand degrees now sir
hold your position scott throws switches to stop the button flashing the ship starts shaking as it passes through the barrier into intergalactic space
we made it
instruments returning to normal captain
all decks report damage and casualties
several systems out sir operating on emergency backup none affect flight procedure
life support systems sustaining on emergency
ll have full report on ship status for you in moment sir
your people are most efficient captain
thank you so are yours
hanar start the neutralising operation hanar leaves
what neutralising operation
you humans are troublesome for us we needed you to get us through the barrier but there aren enough of us to efficiently guard all of you of the time further the food synthesisers cannot manufacture enough food for the entire journey we are therefore neutralising all nonessential personnel
no
the procedure is already underway now as to bridge personnel drea we have no need for communication uhura is reduced to block of salts
and since drea is capable of handling the ship from here on bye chekov and other crew kirk is walking along when he comes across cluster of blocks and some instruments on the floor
do you not agree that this is better thing for them than exploding the ship as your engineer had thought to do we detected it of course tomar has devised mechanism to prevent any further tampering please accept your situation captain it will make things much less painful
is this all
have reviewed ship personnel captain it appears we four are the only ones the kelvans consider essential
scotty tells me you could ve destroyed the ship in the barrier why didn you
couldn
but that was our only chance to stop them
didn think it was
jim
bones that enough
jim saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little
they ve reduced the whole crew thumps table in anger
do not understand why you take the trouble to consume this bulk material to sustain yourselves holds up pill box we have ascertained that these contain all the nutritional elements
before you condemn it why not try it
believe will assist me
it your idea doctor go ahead
all right ll show you how to work the selector he gets tray of food for tomar and sits him down at another table tomar takes cautious mouthful
whispering sir why don we try again to knock out the paralysis projector know the casing looks impenetrable but may be able to do something
even if we could it out of the question we need that projector to bring our people back to human form
then how will we stop the kelvans
captain they look over at tomar who is enjoying his meal
it quite good
delighted
most curious
what is
the isolated glimpses of things saw when touched kelinda mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness the kelvans have superior intellectual capacity to achieve it they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them perceptive senses such as taste touch smell and of course emotions
but then tomar shouldn be enjoying the taste of his food
yes quite correct captain but they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction
if he keeps reacting like that he going to need diet
if they all respond to stimulation of the senses then maybe we can distract them they can have been able to handle the senses yet if we can confuse them enough we can get those devices from their belts
that seems reasonable
all right it may be our only chance look for any way to stimulate the senses
can think of one way right off goes over to tomar lad you re going to need something to wash that down with have you ever tried any saurian brandy mccoy is examining hanar
don know about that
please articulate
well that body of yours is bit anaemic comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance
what are you doing
going to give you shot high-potency vitamin concentrate you ll need three day for few days and eat some solid food will you the brandy bottle is empty and the two men are full of alcohol
no more kelinda is at desk apparently working
am disturbing you
what is it you wish
wish to apologise
don understand captain
for hitting you sorry
that is not necessary you attempted to escape as we would have
yes well don usually go around beating up beautiful women
why not
well there are better things for men and women to do
like what he strokes her collar bone
is this where hit you
no the other side
oh sorry he kisses it is that better
better was it intended as remedy
this is and gives her full-on kiss with embrace
is there some significance to this action
well among humans it meant to express warmth and love
oh you are trying to seduce me have been studying you
me
all humans this business of love you have devoted much literature to it why do you build such mystique around simple biological function
we enjoy it
the literature
kelinda sorry brought up the whole subject
do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable
did
curious let me try she kisses him and rojan enters
is there some problem captain
not when came in kirk leaves
what did he want here
he came to apologise for hitting me apparently it involves some peculiar touching contact
in what manner she kisses him very odd creatures these humans another bottle has been emptied
do you have more
not of this
anything spock and rojan are playing 3d chess
yes humans are very peculiar often find them unfathomable but an interesting psychological study
well do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise
believe you re referring to kiss but it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other
kelinda has no affection for captain kirk
your game is off are you disturbed by the incident
why should be disturbed
you ve known kelinda for some time she kelvan as you are among humans ve found the symptoms you re displaying usually indicate jealousy
have no reason for such reaction kelinda female nothing more
captain kirk seems to find her quite attractive
well of course she is
you are not jealous
no
nor upset
certainly not
checkmate
found this on ganymood er ganymede
what is it
well it er peers at it sniffs it it green kelinda is preening herself in front of mirror when rojan walks in
kelinda ve been thinking
yes
do not wish you to fraternise with any of the humans
why not
well they they offer such strange ideas they re not meant for us not for kelvans
have you given this order to the others
no and wish you to particularly avoid captain kirk
will not you have told me over and over again humans are no threat to us we are superior will do as please
you will do as say or will neutralise your captain kirk and all the other humans as well he has taken rather firm hold of her arm hanar is having another vitamin shot
how many more of these
well now let see you ve had three shots think you better stay on them for few days and then we ll see how you re responding
see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural
you have more
all have is bottle of very very very old scotch whisky
will try it
ll get it takes the helmet off breastplate and reaches in removing very dusty bottle was saving you for
what
never mind gie us your glass
the thing is can tell if we re getting anywhere and haven seen scotty in hours
we haven seen tomar either but my man hanar is getting more irritable by the minute giving him shots of formazine that should have him climbing the walls
rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy kelinda enters
would like to speak with you captain
doctor due for another injection of stokaline
hmm
stokaline
oh you will pardon us spock and mccoy leave
you had something to say
yes this cultural mystique surrounding the biological function
yes
you realise humans are overly preoccupied with the subject
yes we do think great deal about it
ve done some supplemental reading on it and er
you have question
yes was wondering would you please apologise to me again kirk smiles broadly
rojan want to talk to you
very well
first do not like the way responsibility and duty has been portioned out to us
it the way your duties have always been assigned
that is my second quarrel with you
hanar
and further do not care much for the way you run this ship
hanar confine yourself to your quarters hanar storms off the bridge and rojan hits the arm of the captain chair drea stares there whole lot of smooching going on
coming up for air rojan has forbidden me to see you
yes that too bad why do you defy him
it not question of defiance we were told to find out everything we could about you
huh and how the research going
need some more experiments she getting the hang of kissing
mister spock you were not ordered to the bridge what is your purpose here
automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments
very well proceed have you seen captain kirk
if you wish shall call him to the bridge
no was wondering where he was
left him in the recreation room
he was alone then
no kelinda was with him she seemed anxious to speak to him
told her to stay away from him
it would appear sir that you have little control over her or perhaps captain kirk has more rojan leaves the bridge the last drops of scotch go into tomar glass
very interesting but feel rather strange he makes some jerking motions then falls off his chair onto the floor
we did it you and me put him right under the table takes the paralyser off tomar belt ll take this to the captain he gets to the door then stops and gently falls back against the wall he slides to the floor as out of it as tomar is rojan breaks up the kissing session
kelinda told you to avoid this human
did not wish to
am your commander
that not enough rojan
you did this to her corrupted her turned her away from me
if you can keep her that not my problem
you will release her rojan drags kirk away from kalinda kirk slaps him across the face twice finally he has goaded him into fight
why don you use your paralyser you thought was taking your woman away from you you re jealous you tried to kill me with your bare hands would kelvan do that would he have to you re reacting with the emotions of human you are human
no cannot be he throws off kirk into the arms of spock and mccoy who are entering the room
stimulating him mccoy pushes him back into the fight you have no choice to use this ship you have to use our form and now you re stuck with it you and your descendants for the next three hundred years
you fool these bodies are tools we remain kelvans
look what happened in the short time you ve been exposed to us what do you think will happen in three centuries when this ship gets to kelva the people on it will be human they ll be aliens enemies
we have duty our mission we ve got to accomplish any way we can
your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in you can still do that we can bring this problem to the federation there are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited
you would really do that you would extend welcome to invaders they finally stop fighting
no but we would welcome friends
rojan you are only link in chain following an order given three hundred years ago this is an opportunity for you to establish destiny of your own
perhaps perhaps it could be done
robot ship could be sent to kelva with the federation proposal
but if we retain this form where could we find place
seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice
and you you would wish to remain with him
he most interesting but wish to go with you believe owe you an apology she kisses rojan it most pleasurable
yes very curious
you see rojan being human does have certain advantages being able to appreciate the beauty of flower or woman
bridge this is rojan
returning command of the ship to captain kirk you will follow his orders
turn the ship around we re going home doctor mccoy is sampling the local vegetation when his communicator beeps
yes jim
oh about another thirty minutes ve come across some most interesting organic compounds hey starfleet was right kirk is also on the planet house any problems there
no sign of the inhabitants so far kirk out
large prints the ape-like carnivore in the reports
yes the mugato no problem though those prints are several days old they seldom stay in one place
aside from that you say it garden of eden
or so it seemed to the brash young lieutenant kirk on his first planet survey
class in all respects quite earth-like
except these people stayed in their garden of eden bows and arrows for hunting but absolutely no fighting among themselves remarkably peaceful and tranquil kirk and spock dash off to investigate and see three dark-haired locals laying an ambush armed with long-barreled guns
bows and arrows captain
villagers with flintlocks that impossible they hadn progressed nearly that far
captain look group of blond hunters is approaching they do have bows and arrows
one of those men walking into ambush is tyree the friend lived with here he draws his phaser
captain use of our phasers is expressly forbidden so instead kirk throws rock which startles villager into firing his weapon early
villagers there chase hunters after the villagers and the villagers pursuing kirk and spock shot is fired which mccoy hears
enterprise alert stand by to beam up landing party kirk and spock come running then spock gets shot in the back
spock your phaser it is missing so kirk prepares to use his to defend his friend
no captain can travel they join mccoy
beam us up quickly
now scotty have medics stand by they beam out just before the villagers arrive
what happened captain
lead projectile primitive firearm
an african doctor to nurse chapel vitalizer
pressure packet lucky his heart where his liver should be or he be dead now
not good sir
coranalin
bones can you save him to red alert
kirk here
on my way scotty bones
don know yet jim
captain we re holding the planet between us and the klingons don think they ve spotted us
make that definite sir they re sending routine message to their home base with no mention of us
good go to yellow alert
yellow alert all stations go to yellow alert
do you think you can keep us out of their sight chekov
can try captain
message to starbase sir
no point in giving ourselves away lieutenant not until we find out what going on
we can hide for while sir but we may have to go out of orbit to keep it up for long
kirk to sickbay out
so they ve broken the treaty
not necessarily captain they have as much right to scientific missions here as we have
research is not the klingon way
true but since this is hands-off planet how are you going to prove they re doing otherwise
when left there thirteen years ago those villagers had barely learned to forge iron spock was shot with flintlock how many centuries between those two developments
on earth about twelve sir
on the other hand flintlock would be the first firearm the inhabitants would normally develop
yes aware of that mister scott
and sir the fact earth took twelve centuries doesn mean they had to
we ve seen different development at rates on different planets
and were the klingons behind it why didn they give them breechloaders
or machine guns
or old-style hand lasers
did not invite debate sorry worried about spock and concerned about what happened to something once knew down there you have the conn scotty ll be in sickbay
we ve no replacements for the damaged organs sir if he going to live his vulcan physiology will have to do it for him
agreed sterilite off
yes sir
he ll live or die now jim don know which doctor benga interned on vulcan ward he couldn be in better hands
then you and are transporting down
can leave spock at this time
you just indicated you could there are klingons here if their mission is legitimate research interest in the planet organic potential then you re the one man who can tell me
and if that not it
then need help advice can trust as much as spock
appreciate the compliment jim but
bones as worried about spock as you are but if the klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war kirk to bridge
mccoy and are transporting back down inform ship stores that we ll need native costumes
captain we may have to break out of orbit any minute to keep out of their sight we be out of communicator range with you
understand we ll arrange rendezvous schedule kirk out captain log stardate 4211 keeping our presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage therefore cannot risk contact with starfleet command must take action on my own judgment ve elected to violate orders and make contact with planet inhabitants mccoy and kirk are dressed in the leathers of hill people
perfect tyree camp quarter of mile away
want to think about it again jim starfleet orders about this planet state no interference with
no interference with normal social development not only aware of it it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it
read it inhabitants superior in many ways to humans left alone they undoubtedly someday will develop remarkably advanced and peaceful culture
indeed and intend to see that they have that chance you coming with me
do have choice so they make their way down the slope and kirk gets pounced on by big white ape with large horn on it head and spines down it back it easily throws off mccoy as it concentrates on it first victim biting him throwing rocks makes it stand up then mccoy vaporizes it with his phaser
shaking contact ship took full poison fangs
enterprise mccoy emergency come in enterprise come in mccoy emergency
they left out of orbit
giving an injection jim there is no antitoxin for this poison can only keep you alive few hours with this
tyree some of his men cure three men are standing in front of them
are you hill people do you know hunter named tyree mugato attacked him he james kirk he friend of tyree blast it do something he dying kirk passes out
take him to the cave bring tyree right about the people here despite their fear and our strangeness they re compassionate and gentle ve learned the hunter tyree is now their leader he is expected to return shortly with his wife who they say knows how to cure this poison my problem the captain is in deep shock must keep him warm and alive until then mccoy wraps plenty of furs around kirk
you and your garden of eden man and dark-haired woman come out of hiding after two armed villagers pass
we must obtain the same firesticks husband you could be killing them instead we could take their houses their goods
nona enough in time the villagers will return to their ways of friendship
in time they kill your people am kahn-ut-tu woman in all this land how many are there men seek us because through us they become great leaders
took you because you cast spell upon me
and have spells that help me keep you remember this leaf the night we camped by the water
the night of madness
oh tyree did you really hate that madness she rubs the leaf down his arm scratching him and leaving pieces attached to his skin
no nona no it brought up evil beasts from my soul
only one lovely beast tyree my huge angry man they kiss passionately
forgive me
what is it
there are strangers in our camp one has taken the mugato bite he dies
strangers
it is said the dying one is friend of tyree from long ago
that one bring him when his head clears kirk is shivering under his furs so mccoy uses his phaser to heat rock
the stranger where is he she is pointed to the cave mccoy is heating another couple of rocks when she arrives the sight of such powerful weapon stops her from going in tyree arrives running
nona where kirk the cave
tyree you wish me to save him
you must he is the one told you of the friend of my younger days
my remedies require know what kind of man he is all that is known of him
gave him my promise of silence he was made my brother
and am your wife his sister promise silence also
nona
quickly or he dies the indicators over spock bed are very low chapel is holding his hand but puts it down quickly when the door opens
don let these low panel readings bother you ve seen this before in vulcans it their way of concentrating all their strength blood and antibodies onto the injured organs form of self-induced hypnosis
you mean he conscious
well in sense he knows we re here and what we re saying but he can afford to take his mind from the tissue he fighting to heal suppose he even knows you were holding his hand leaves
good nurse always treats her patients that way it proves she interested
am tyree
and tyree woman
it is kirk she will cure him nona takes strange object out of her bag it is moving slightly
what that
mahko root
plant it moves
for those who know where to find it how to use it how to pick it she holds out her hand and tyree cuts it with his knife then she starts writhing for few moments before putting the mahko root onto kirk wound and holding it there with her bleeding hand
take this of my soul this of my soul thine own into thine deeply together your pain is mine all mine your soul and mine together return it is past return return tyree beats drum then she collapses exhausted across kirk bare chest the root is shriveled kirk wakes up
bones had the strangest dream
how do you feel jim
tired very tired you did fine job bones think ll sleep mccoy removes the root the would has healed completely
want to thank you for saving his life nona hand is healed too would like to learn more about this
our blood has passed through the mahko root together our souls have been together he is mine now
she must sleep also
he is hers
when man and woman are joined in this manner he can refuse her no wish but it is only legend later mccoy wakes to find jim is out of bed he finds him by nona bed
jim
bones what are you doing here their voices wake tyree tyree my old friend
yes james james it good to see you
what am doing here mugato bite remember told him to take me to tyree camp knew you find kahn-ut-tu to cure me the kahn-ut-tu is the local witch people here they ve studied nona gets up and stands in front of him they ve studied the roots and the herbs
am kahn-ut-tu captain cured you
my wife nona
yes of course should ve guessed congratulations tyree we must talk now the villagers their new weapons want to hear all about that we must make plans
good it is past time to plan
much has happened since you left james come we ll speak of it
and of things to be done
come the men leave but he stops nona from following we will speak of it the markers on the indicator board above spock head are going up and down like crazy
the readings are beginning to fluctuate
just as they should this is doctor benga there will be someone with you constantly now when the time comes ll be called to chapel as soon as he shows any signs of consciousness call me immediately
yes doctor
after you ve called me if he speaks do whatever he says
do whatever he says
yes that clear enough isn it
the firesticks first appeared nearly year ago since that time many of my people have died
you say they make the firesticks themselves how can you be sure
ve looked into their village have seen it being done
have you seen any strangers among the villagers
strangers no
can you take us to their village while it still dark
yes but the mugatos travel at night also you killed one its mate will not be far
showing his phaser you ve seen how these work
ve seen them also and know you have many ways to make your friend tyree man of great importance
many ways what else does she know about us
tyree has told me much of you do not blame him it was the price for saving your life
we re simply strangers from
from one of the lights in the sky and you have ways as far above firesticks as the sky above our world
you will not speak of this to others
will not if am made to understand teach me there an old custom among my people when woman saves man life he is grateful
am grateful
splendid custom if not carried to extremes
we once were as you are spears arrows there came time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom and we almost destroyed ourselves we learned from this to make rule during all our travels never to cause the same to happen to other worlds just as man must grow in his own way and in his own time
some men never grow
perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should but we re wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of man or another world
you must let the villagers destroy us you will not help your friend and brother kill them instead
no said will not kill
we must fight or die is dying better you would let him die when you have weapons to make him powerful and safe then he has the wrong friends and have the wrong husband leaves
you will help in ways she does not understand have faith in our friendship james come before we lose the darkness leaves
what bothering you jim if we find the klingons have helped the villagers there certainly something we can do
that what bothering me the something we may have to do smooth walled buildings with tiled roofs shrubs in terracotta jars an armed guard patrols in front of one with verandah
the guard we must wait
tyree supposing you had to fight what then
jim this man believes in the same thing we believe in that killing is stupid and useless
tyree
now come kirk sneaks around behind the guard and puts sleeper hold on him
the gun ammunition doctor mccoy and kirk run off while tyree picks up the flintlock klingon is sitting behind simple wooden table
you are late my friend apella
quarrel by my people division of some skins and hill woman taken this morning it hard to divide one woman
give her to the man who killed the most of her people the others will see the profit in bravery ll make klingon of you yet he hands over another flintlock your next improvement notice what we ve done to the striker see how it holds the priming powder more securely fewer misfires when return we will give you other improvements rifled barrel
what
way to shoot further and straighter
jim coal for forge sulphur for gun powder
let take look inside big bellows runs straight into the base of the fire
well here your forge people exhibit number one chrome steel drill point
scanning this pig iron is almost carbon-free that village furnace certainly didn produce it people exhibit number two cold-rolled gun barrel rod fashioned to look homemade you were right about the klingons jim
make recorder and scanner tapes of everything
right it pity we can include live klingon that just about wrap it he is interrupted by voices from outside they hide apella and krell enter the forge
thought my people would grow tired of killing but you were right they see that it is easier than trading and it has pleasures feel it myself like the hunt but with richer rewards
you will be rich one day apella beyond your dreams the leader of whole world governor in the klingon empire then mccoy scanner whistles so kirk jumps the klingon while mccoy hits apella with the steel rod he took
bones they open the door but there are two more armed villagers outside nevertheless they knock them out and get away
to tyree move fast shots are fired as the three run for their lives out of the village spock starts gasping for air
nurse
yes
hit me the pain will help me to consciousness hit me
hit you no can
blast you strike me if don regain consciousness soon it may be too late hit me she slaps his face harder she does with tears in her eyes
again continue the pain will help me to consciousness
running in and dragging her away what are you doing woman
leave me alone
have you gone daft
mister spock needs me let go benga rushes in and helps spock to sit up before giving him some pretty vicious hits across the face scott stares astonished finally spock grabs benga arm
that will be quite enough thank you doctor
please release her
what this all about
she was doing as requested mister scott vulcan form of self-healing
as you saw they must wait until the last possible moment then fight their way back to consciousness
here let me help you mister spock
thank you nurse quite fully recovered
yes see you are just slightly away from the tents kirk is giving rifle shooting lesson
men this is the pan this is the hammer the hammer striking the pan causes spark ignites the powder and fires the flintlock now aim it as showed you hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently tyree shoots the clay pot target well done very very very good
jim want to talk to you
not here bones in the cave yutan your turn
do have to say it it not bad enough there one serpent in eden teaching one side about gun powder you want to make sure they all know about it
exactly each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm
have you gone out of your mind yes maybe you have tyree wife she said there was something in that root she said now you can refuse her nothing
superstition
is it coincidence this is exactly what she wants
is it she wants superior weapons that the one thing neither side can have bones bones the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers the klingons changed that with the flintlocks if this planet is to develop the way it should we must equalize both sides again
jim that means you re condemning this whole planet to war that may never end it could go on for year after year massacre after massacre
all right doctor all right say wrong say drugged say the woman drugged me what is your sober sensible solution to all this
don have solution but furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer
bones do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the asian continent two giant powers involved much like the klingons and ourselves neither side felt could pull out
yes remember it went on bloody year after bloody year
what would you have suggested that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had no the only solution is what happened back then balance of power
and if the klingons give their side even more
then we arm our side with exactly that much more balance of power the trickiest most difficult dirtiest game of them all but the only one that preserves both sides
and what about your friend tyree will he understand this balance of power
no probably not but going to have to try and make him understand never had more difficult task
well jim here another morsel of agony for you since tyree won fight he will be one of the first to die
well war isn good life but it life his wife is the only way to reach him if tell her we re going to supply guns maybe she ll convince him
position mister scott
entering distant orbit sir approaching rendezvous time
the klingons
they haven spotted us yet sir looks like they re beaming someone aboard
stand by to signal the captain
aye sir kirk finds nona near stream which is running over rock she has been bathing
nona pardon me
you are here because wished you here
oh thought it was my idea
yes they always believe they come of free will tyree thought the same when cast my first spell on him
nona
can you smell this fragrance some find it pleasing it is the same planet that she used on tyree
like to talk to you
again some find it soothing yes
would like
happy yes you feel good tyree overhears her and he is carrying gun
feel dizzy yes you are lovely you re beautiful tyree takes aim
kiss me kirk gives in but tyree cannot bring himself to squeeze the trigger he throws the gun down in disgust and runs nona and kirk are interrupted by the shriek of mugato kirk is so besotted that nona has difficulty getting out of his embrace and trying to escape eventually kirk thinks to draw his phaser and kill the attacking creature she decides to hit him over the head to get the phaser for herself tyree returns
where captain kirk tyree the firestick where is it
there left it there
that fine thing to leave lying around show us where it is nona has just left when mccoy tyree and yutan arrive yutan picks up the rifle
do not want it
jim jim who hit you
nona nona greets band of villagers
bring you victory for apella
tyree woman
she kahn-ut-tu
we won trust this division to apella
take me to him he will have the strength to use this new weapon villager number one grabs nona and she slaps him off
touch me again and this small box will kill you they don believe her and all four men struggle with her mccoy is about to give kirk an injection to go with the headache pills
no no all right my phaser she took it
this weapon bring you is far greater than your firesticks still all the men want is to have their wicked way with her and she screams kirk tyree and mccoy come running over the brow
nona
hill people
it trap the woman tricked us he stabs her another man shoots mccoy in the arm yutan fires back then there is good old-fashioned hand-to-hand struggle tyree smashes one man head repeatedly with large rock until kirk stops him he goes to his wife
she dead tyree picks up rifle
want more of these kirk many more yutan two of those who killed my wife have escaped track them down will kill them mccoy finds the phaser in the dirt nearby
here
tomorrow in the palm of her hands
well you got what you wanted
not what wanted bones what had to be mccoy hands him communicator from his bag kirk here
spock are you alive
an illogical question doctor since obviously you are hearing my voice
well don know why was worried you can kill computer
spock ask scotty how long it would take him to reproduce hundred flintlocks
losing his grin didn get that exactly captain hundred what
hundred serpents serpents for the garden of eden we re very tired mister spock beam us up home plenty of security around and blonde woman instead of uhura at communications
the distress call definitely came from one of the solar systems in this sector
can you pinpoint it any closer lieutenant
negative it was so badly garbled all we got was the name constellation then we lost it
sir we re now within the limits of system l-370 but can seem to locate
captain sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed nothing left but rubble and asteroids
but that incredible the star in this system is still intact only nova could destroy like that
nonetheless captain sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year
continue search pattern
aye aye sir later
entering limits of system l-374 sir scanners show the same evidence of destruction
every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the constellation matt decker in command what could have happened to him
captain the two inner most planets of this system appear to be intact
sir picking up ship disaster beacon
try to raise it lieutenant
have it on the sensors captain by configuration starship stopped in space she appears to be drifting
no answer captain all get is the automatic beacon
sensors not recording normal energy output
approach course mister sulu they arrive at ship hanging crookedly in space it looks identical to enterprise
it the constellation look at that
she may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems
she was attacked red alert red alert man your battle stations
red alert red alert man your battle stations
mister sulu
all phaser banks manned and ready sir
very good initiate full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel
aye sir
lieutenant palmer
can raise the constellation sir still getting the distress beacon but there heavy subspace interference it almost blocking the signal
keep trying mister spock full evaluation of the damage to the constellation
all power plants dead reserve energy banks operative at very low power level
life support systems
also operative at low power level the entire bridge is damaged and uninhabitable the rest of the ship seems able to sustain life
radiation levels
normal but subspace interference makes readings difficult
no other vessels in the area captain all scanners show clear
all hands go to yellow alert stand by battle stations lieutenant have doctor mccoy mister scott and damage control party report to me in the transporter room
aye aye sir
we re going to board her mister spock you re in command
acknowledged the name ship for the constellation-class is mess with chunks blown out of her nacelles and saucer inside pipes are hanging down twisted
radiation level normal atmospheric pressure eleven pounds per square inch
filtration systems are out sir
the whole communication system looks to be shorted out too sir
scotty check the phaser banks see if they ve been fired bones you come with me
come along lads they head down ladder while mccoy and kirk walk off
what mess
no clutter no half-empty cups of coffee whatever happened didn happen without warning
what do you think did it sir
don know lad but want full structural and control damage check and going to have look at those engines
the crew wasn abducted they just left kirk to enterprise
no survivors no bodies either down to one of the two planets
improbable captain the surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead the other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life
we ll continue our search kirk out scott returns to the beam-in point
captain ve checked the engines the warp drive is hopeless pile of junk the impulse engines are not too badly off we ought to be able to do something with them
phaser banks
exhausted they didn give up without battle
but where are they can imagine man like matt decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative
computer system is still intact we can playback the duplicate captain log from the auxiliary control room they head off then kirk spots man at desk in room the man is conscious but dazed stunned
matt matt it jim kirk
commodore commodore decker he injects him
matt matt
kirk it jim kirk
what happened to your ship matt
ship attacked that that thing
what thing what was it
that
answer me what was it what happened matt
jim give him minute he in state of shock
ready with the duplicate log sir
go subspace interference still prevents our contacting starfleet to inform them of the destroyed solar systems we have encountered we are now entering system l-374 science officer masada reports the fourth planet seems to be breaking up we are going to investigate
the fourth planet only two left now scotty pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to spock want full analysis complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet
we tried to contact starfleet no one heard no one we couldn run
what happened to your crew
oh had to beam them down we were dead no power our phasers useless stayed behind the last man the captain the last man aboard the ship that what you re supposed to do isn it and then it hit again and the transporter went out they were down there and up here
what hit what attacked you
they say there no devil jim but there is right out of hell saw it
matt where your crew
on the third planet
there is no third planet
don you think know that there was but not anymore they called me they begged me for help four hundred of them couldn couldn breaks down in tears
captain washburn has our report
go
we made complete check on structural and control damage sir as far as we can tell something crashed through the deflectors and knocked out the generators somehow the antimatter in the warp drive pods has been deactivated
deactivated scotty could some kind of general energy dampening field do that and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference
aye that all adds up but what sort of thing could do all that
if you seen it you know the whole thing weapon it must be
what does it look like
well it miles long with maw that could swallow dozen starships it destroys planets chops them into rubble
what is it an alien ship or is it alive or is it
both or neither don know
matt your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up you went in to investigate
we saw this thing hovering over the planet slicing out chunks of it with force beam
did you run scanner check on it what kind of beam
pure antiproton absolutely pure
answers communicator kirk here
unable to raise starfleet command due to heavy subspace interference
what about the constellation tapes
she was attacked by what appears to be essentially robot an automated weapon of immense size and power its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel it is therefore self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on
robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems why
unknown captain however mister sulu has computed the path of the machine using the destroyed solar systems as base course projecting back on our star charts we find that it came from outside from another galaxy
if it follows its present path it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy
thank you stand by mister spock kirk out
this whole thing incredible robot machine like that who would build it
we don know an alien race apparently from another galaxy
but why
bones did you ever hear of doomsday machine
no doctor not mechanic
it weapon built primarily as bluff it never meant to be used so strong it could destroy both sides in war something like the old h-bomb was supposed to be that what think this is doomsday machine that somebody used in war uncounted years ago they don exist anymore but the machine is still destroying
oh forget about your theories that thing is on the way to the heart of our galaxy what are you going to do about it
take it easy
the first thing we re going to do is get you back to the enterprise
oh no stay here not leaving my ship
there no ship to leave it dead hulk we ll take her in tow ll stay onboard and get her ready you go back to the enterprise with the doctor and let him help you
it just that never lost command before
kirk to enterprise have the transporter room beam doctor mccoy and commodore decker on board immediately as kyle beams them aboard spock impassionate voice can be heard
come on
it came up on us fast captain but we seem able to maintain our distance decker and mccoy enter the viewscreen shows thing with big yellow maw that tapers down along it body to pointed tail
it looks very much like commodore decker planet killer and it is pursuing us the viewscreen now shows it head-on round opening with small sun partway down the gullet
we are more manoeuvrable but it is gaining on us sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive interference level incredibly high
whatever it is we can let it go beyond us to the next solar system we have to stop it if it robot what are the chances of deactivating it
would say none captain the energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing direct attack upon ourselves machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms
it closing on us mister spock
closing captain
all right lower your deflector screens long enough to beam us aboard landing party aboard
ready to beam sir but the monster fires ray at them everyone goes flying and smoke comes out of transporter pad
evasive action mister sulu
aye sir
damage report all stations
affect repairs captain kirk come in please
captain we ve been attacked the transporter is damaged we re taking evasive action
mister spock communication damaged we re unable to override interference interference will static
spock spock come in spock spock we re stuck blind and deaf
and paralysed no power
well we just can stand around while our ship is being attacked scotty you ve got to get me some manoeuvering power
can repair warp drive without spacedock
then get me impulse power half-speed quarter-speed anything if we get this hulk moving maybe we can do something
aye the impulse engines are still in fair shape might coax them
then get moving
come on lad
washburn you get in there let see what we can do about this viewing screen ve got to find out what happening out there
no casualties mister spock how are we doing
we have outrun it doctor
status report
impulse and warp engines operative transporter and communications under repair random chance seems to have operated in our favour
in plain non-vulcan english we ve been lucky
believe said that doctor
it veering off back on course for the next solar system the rigel colony sir
evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as ship beyond certain radius we ll maintain discreet distance and circle back to pick up the captain
you can let that reach rigel why millions of innocent people would die
am aware of the rigel system population commodore but we are only one ship our deflector shields are strained our subspace transmitter is useless logically our primary duty is to survive in order to warn starfleet command
our primary duty is to maintain life and safety of federation planets do you deny that
mister sulu you will lay in an evasive course back to the constellation
aye aye sir
belay that last order helmsman one hundred and eighty degree turn hard about we re going to attack the whole bridge holds its breath
you will carry out my last order mister sulu
mister spock officially notifying you that exercising my option under regulations as starfleet commodore and that am assuming command of the enterprise
you have the right to do so but would advise against it
that thing must be destroyed
you tried to destroy it once before commodore the result was wrecked ship and dead crew
made mistake then we were too far away this time going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range
sensors show the object hull is solid neutronium single ship cannot combat it
mister spock that will be all you have been relieved of command don force me to relieve you of duty as well
you can let him do this spock
doctor you are out of line
so are you sir well spock
unfortunately starfleet order 104 section leaves me no alternative paragraph 1a clearly states
to blazes with regulations you can let him take command when you know he wrong
if you can certify commodore decker medically or psychologically unfit for command can relieve him under section
ll certify that right now
you ll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it
now you know haven had time to run an examination on him
then your statement would not be considered valid
you may leave the bridge doctor
what about the captain we can leave
doctor you may leave the bridge
spock do something
mister spock knows his duty under regulations doctor do you mccoy leaves hard about helmsman course thirty two degrees mark ten deflectors at full power ready on main phaser banks
aye aye sir spock stands completely still like statue as enterprise arrives back at the planet-killer kirk is trying to mend the viewscreen but just making smoke and spluttering noises
kirk here
captain the impulse engines control circuits are fused solid
aye we can cross-connect the controls but it ll make the ship almost impossible for one man to handle
you worry about your miracles scotty ll worry about mine get to work
aye sir
washburn try the 2g6 circuit
closing fast
deflector shields at full power they can take much more of this
helmsman hold your course stand by all phaser banks
aye aye sir the planet killer fires at them
deflectors holding but weakening we must retreat commodore the energy drain
in command here mister spock maintain your course helmsman get us in closer
ready to give it try
just one minute sir
scotty how you doing
controls are all hooked up sir we should have some power for you soon
try it now captain
yes think an image of tiny enterprise and the giant planet killer comes on screen what the devil going on
fire two phaser beams strafe the machine body
direct hit it just bounced off
commodore urgently recommend immediate withdrawal
recommendation noted maintain course fire
kirk to enterprise come in enterprise come in mister spock come in kirk to enterprise scotty where that power
coming sir if push these impulse engines too hard in the condition they re in they ll blow apart
washburn get down to engineering assist mister scott
aye sir leaves
scotty push it right to the edge this ship has got to manoeuver another blast from the machine spock; sir deflector shields are gone
to spock sir deck seven reports power failure in main energisers implementing emergency procedures another hit severe casualties reported on decks three and four damage control party sealing off inner hull rupture
it has ceased fire we re being held in tractor beam we re being pulled inside commodore you must veer off
maintain phaser fire helmsman
we have lost warp power if we don break the tractor beam within sixty seconds we never will
but don you understand we ve got to destroy it
that sir is illogical it is suicide attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command if you don veer off shall relieve you on that basis
veer off
emergency impulse power
we can break loose spock; we need more power
we haven got it we re being pulled inside kirk sees enterprise approach the planet-killer mouth
scotty give me that power
you ve got it captain just enough to move us can do better
that ll do full ahead mister scott sudden jolt as constellation overcomes inertia
that it mister scott keep that power coming
full power astern
aye sir we still can move
keep pouring it on scotty
captain still don know what we re doing
we re moving the enterprise isn maybe that thing will see us and let the enterprise go if only had some phasers
phasers you ve got em have one bank recharged
scotty you ve just earned your pay for the week stand by fire phasers one beam lances out and the monster turns
we re loose commodore
good boy jim between the two of us we ll kill that thing
mister scott it worked great sees that maw turning towards them think it great scotty get us out of here
it closing fast on the constellation
standing by sir
commodore suggest
kirk pulled us out of there by distracting it now it our turn fire phasers they do we did it hard about give me some distance
we re moving away commodore
this machine seems to have programmed defensive sphere any energy source entering that field is subject to attack
mister spock status report
warp drive and deflectors will be out for solar day repairs proceeding on transporter and communications
it closing with us again sir
maintain speed and distance
it sucking in space rubble from those destroyed planets refueling itself
we can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel but it can refuel itself indefinitely
then we ll have to fight it now before it gets any stronger
illogical we cannot destroy it therefore we cannot save rigel we must transport the captain and the others from the constellation and escape this thing subspace interference in order to warn starfleet command
mister spock we ve pierced the interference locally
can you raise starfleet
no sir but ve got ship-to-ship communications back picking up captain kirk
on audio lieutenant
mister spock am still in command will speak for this ship enterprise to kirk
matt what going on give me mister spock
in command here jim
nothing assumed command according to regulations to take aggressive action against the kirk you mean you re the lunatic who responsible for almost destroying my ship
you are speaking to senior officer kirk
give me spock
told you am in command here according to every rule in the book captain anything you have to say at all you will say to me
there only one thing want to say to you commodore get my ship out of there
commodore
down here the arm of the captain chair
warp drive out deflector shields down transporter under repair we are on emergency impulse power
how long to repair warp drive
at our present rate of consumption we ll exhaust our impulse power long before then
it gaining on us sir
take evasive action mister sulu
told you am in command here and will give the orders captain we re going to turn and attack
mister spock relieve commodore decker immediately that direct order
you can relieve me and you know it according to regulations
blast regulations mister spock order you to assume command on my personal authority as captain of the enterprise
commodore decker you are relieved of command
don recognise your authority to relieve me
you may file formal protest with starfleet command assuming we survive to reach starbase but you are relieved commodore do not wish to place you under arrest
you wouldn dare spock signals the guards forward you re bluffing
vulcans never bluff
no no don suppose that they do very well mister spock the bridge is yours
captain have assumed command
one moment sir commodore believe you are scheduled for medical examination mister montgomery
sir
you will accompany the commodore to sickbay
aye sir commodore they leave
mister sulu change course seven zero mark two one
mark twenty one sir
captain we are taking an evasive course back to you we will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard
fine just make sure you stay ahead of it back on the enterprise decker fights montgomery when they exit turbolift two it takes while but eventually the red-shirt is knocked out and dragged into side room decker then makes his way to the shuttlecraft hangar deck
yes scotty
ve hooked in ship communication the best can give you on impulse is one third power the shields are up but they won last long
keep it going scotty keep it going mister spock
plotting an intercept course will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours
mister spock someone opening the shuttlecraft bay doors
shut them mister sulu
it too late sir
kirk to enterprise why are you launching shuttlecraft
whoever it is captain has no authorisation lieutenant raise the shuttlecraft
enterprise to shuttlecraft come in shuttlecraft shuttlecraft come in shuttlecraft
shuttlecraft to enterprise decker here
commodore must insist that you return to the ship
you said it yourself spock there is no way to blast through the hull of that machine so going to take this thing right down its throat
this is kirk matt you ll be killed
ve been prepared for death ever since ever since killed my crew
no one expects you to die for an error in judgment
the commander is responsible for the lives of his crew and for their deaths well should have died with mine
you cannot succeed commodore your only logical alternative is to return to the ship
matt matt listen to me you can throw your life away like this matt you re starship commander that makes you valuable commodity judgment matt decker turns off the intercom
we re stronger with you than without you the shuttlecraft enters the planet killer and decker dies in agony from the radiation
he gone constellation come in please
kirk here
sir may offer my condolences on the death of your friend it is most regrettable
it regrettable that he died for nothing
mister spock sensors indicate minute drop in the machine power emanations do you think the shuttlecraft explosion might have done some damage
the drop in power is definite captain but negligible the object is still pursing us thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at much greater rate
mister spock the transporter is now operational
transporter operational captain shall we beam you aboard
negative beam the damage control party aboard
there little to be gained by staying aboard the constellation
except possibly the destruction of that thing out there carry out your orders mister spock
acknowledged transporter room beam damage control party aboard
spock listen maybe matt decker didn die for nothing he had the right idea but not enough power to do it am correct in assuming that fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if starship impulse engine is overloaded
no sir ninety seven point eight three five megatons
ninety seven point eight three five will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there
negative captain its hull is pure neutronium there is no known way of blasting through it
not through it spock from inside it will it be enough
insufficient data shall try to take further sensor readings
do the best you can and make it fast kirk to scott
here sir the damage control party just beamed back to the enterprise
good scotty can you set the ship impulse engines to overload
aye the shape the thing in it hard to keep her from blowing kirk want you to rig thirty second delay detonation device and rig it so that it can be blown from up here
aye sir
set it and get up here as fast as you can
the object neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible
spock you don know
captain you re getting dangerously close to the planet killer
intend to get lot closer going to ram her right down that thing throat
jim you ll be killed just like decker
no no don intend to die mister spock we ve rigged delay detonation device you ll have thirty seconds to beam me aboard the enterprise before the constellation impulse engines blow
your chances of survival are not promising we don even know if the explosion will be powerful enough
calculated risk mister spock working at one hundred percent efficiency
thirty seconds is very slim timing
chance ll have to take kirk out
cranky transporter mighty finicky piece of machinery to be gambling your life on sir
what about the detonator
ve linked it in with the impulse control system flips switch it armed now press this one thirty seconds later poof once it activated there no way to stop it
understood mister spock prepare to beam scotty on board
good luck captain
thank you it takes longer than usual to materialise mister scott
what the matter with that thing
it power drain somewhere sir almost lost you
it ll never work like this it the main junction circuitry ll get it
bridge transporter malfunction
transporter is out captain you ll have to stand by
can power level dropping too fast you better hurry amid spluttering cables
he two thousand miles from the planet killer and closing fast the cables stop spluttering
bridge transporter operational but this jury-rigging won last for long he got to come off now
fifteen hundred miles and closing
captain transporter operational but just barely
prepare to beam me aboard on my signal
one thousand miles and closing
transporter stand by
five hundred miles and closing the throat of the machine fills the screen when he flips the final red switch
beam me aboard
energise
energising bridge it shorted out again
och what wrong with it
gentlemen beam me aboard
mister scott twenty seconds to detonation
mister scott
sixty fifty forty
gentlemen suggest you beam me aboard
ten
try her now mister kyle we see the constellation enter the planet-killer we see kyle frantically to beam something in we see cloud coming out of the planet-killer before there bang
bridge we got him through
energy output zero radiation level normal kirk runs in
welcome aboard captain sensors show all energy sources deactivated it quite dead
mister sulu ease us back to minimum headway conserve power as much as possible lieutenant palmer tell mister scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive poor matt he gave his life in an attempt to save others not the worst way to go
indeed captain presume your log will show that commodore decker died in the line of duty
indeed it shall mister spock ironic isn it way back in the 20th century the h-bomb was the ultimate weapon their doomsday machine and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine probably the first time such weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes
appropriate captain however can help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe
well certainly hope not found one quite sufficient kirk spock mccoy scott chekov and galway beam down to group of pre-fabricated buildings the sky is orange
where is everyone
perhaps they weren expecting us
our arrival was scheduled well in advance doctor the annual check of every scientific expedition is routine
had subspace contact with robert johnson the leader of this expedition an hour ago
did he report anything wrong
no yet there was something wrong can pin it down his conversation was disjointed his thoughts little foggy unrelated chekov check that building mister spock and will check this one the rest of you take look around see if you can find anyone chekov goes into the dark building it has no windows and the light comes on as he bumps up against table bearing the body of very old man he panics and runs out again
captain captain captain captain
what is it
man sir in there dead man again the lights only come on when the party reaches the table in the middle of the room
well
exactly what it looks like death by natural causes old age
quite impossible doctor ran personnel check on this expedition before we beamed down assure you that none of them were he is interrupted by the entrance of an old man and woman
to the woman they ve come to pay their respects to alvin
captain kirk of
you ll have to speak louder
say captain kirk of the uss enterprise who are you
robert johnson this is my wife elaine
how old are you how old are you
er let me see am twenty nine and elaine is
twenty seven captain log stardate 3478 on routine mission to re-supply the experimental colony at gamma hydra four we discovered most unusual phenomenon of the six members of the colony none of whom were over thirty we found four had died and two were dying of old age
mister johnson can you hear me
can hear you not deaf yet you know not yet
can you tell me what happened
what happened
did your instruments show anything
elaine was so beautiful so beautiful so beautiful
he can hear you jim but he doesn understand let let him rest
to nurse if they seem lucid ll be in the briefing room
stay seated commodore stocker ve asked you to be part of this briefing because gamma hydra four falls in your administrative area
appreciate that sir
doctor wallace as an expert in endocrinology appreciate you working very closely doctor mccoy
young blonde woman in pink dress yes captain
doctor mccoy would you fill them in
the expedition is suffering from extreme old age and they re growing older by the minute much older my examinations have turned up absolutely nothing in fact don have clue
what about the atmosphere and environment mister spock
sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life the atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays
we re close to the neutral zone between our federation and the romulan empire it possible the romulans have new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs
have already begun investigation into that possibility captain
good want you all to check out everything in your own departments no matter how remote how far-fetched the notion want it run down we ll stay in orbit until we have the answer
sure you understand that anxious to get to starbase ten to assume my new post
yes commodore we ll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty
thank you sir everyone leaves but doctor wallace remains seated
doctor is there something can do for you
well be little less the cool efficient captain and little more the old friend
how long has it been
six years four months and an odd number of days you mean you don know
well it been long time things wouldn change if it started all over again would it you have your job have my ship and neither one of us will change
you said it didn in all those years only heard from you once stargram when my husband died you know you never asked me why got married after we called it off
well supposed that you met someone you loved
met man admired great man
and in your field as you you didn give up thing
no just you bridge
on my way
standard orbit captain
maintain
ve rechecked the sensors captain gamma hydra four checks out as class planet with conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass can find nothing at all out of the ordinary
what about the comet that astrophysics reported
we re checking it on it ve reached no conclusions as yet the comet was rogue and has never been investigated
captain kirk
yes commodore
facilities at starbase ten are much more complete than those on board ship it seems to me that your investigations would be facilitated if we proceeded there assure you all co-operation
thank you you re anxious to get to the base but we have few facilities of our own here think the enterprise will do quite nicely ll be in engineering mister spock maintain standard orbit mister sulu
you already gave that command sir
oh well follow it
lieutenant galway
petite woman doctor may speak to you for moment please
of course go right ahead
know this is going to sound foolish but seem to be having little trouble hearing
it probably nothing important
never had trouble before
well don worry about it perhaps little hypersonic treatment might clear it up
thank you
progress report mister spock
astronomical section reports that comet recently passed by check into that order we discussed that earlier
oh yes let me know what you come up with ll be in the sickbay kirk turns to put on clean shirt and jerks putting hand to his back mccoy and chapel are putting sheet over the face of patient
the last one robert johnson cause of death old age
you did what you could
which adds up to absolutely nothing see you
all you need are vitamins but you can come up anyhow
bones believe you re getting grey
you take over my job and see what happens to you
see what you mean
what your problem jim
shoulder just twinge probably muscular strain
you re probably right doctor by the way don like how you ve been running this ship lately
all right reprimand received go ahead mccoy scans his arm then takes hold of finger kirk pulls back in pain
jim think we better run complete physical on you
why just muscular strain isn it
no jim it advanced arthritis and it spreading
that impossible
can run it through again but ll come up with the same thing scott enters his hair light grey and his face deeply lined
scotty captain log stardate 3579 the enterprise personnel who beamed down to the planet surface doctor mccoy engineer scott mister spock lieutenant galway and myself are all showing definite signs of aging only ensign chekov appears to be normal chekov is on the stamina machine spock is on bio-bed kirk and mccoy are definitely looking older chapel and wallace are also present
report bones
all of us who went down to the surface with the exception of chekov are aging at various rates approximately thirty years for each day don know what causing it virus bacteria or evil spirits but trying to find out
spock could ask for some figures
looking about the same as usual based on what doctor mccoy gave me estimate that physically we each have less than week to live also since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time
total senility
yes captain in very short time
what way to die all right want all the research facilities all the scientific technicians to start round-the-clock research immediately want the answers and want the remedy let start by finding out why chekov hasn been affected
doing what can to spock you re perfectly healthy
sitting up must differ with you doctor having difficulty concentrating which is most disturbing my eye sight appears to be failing and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold
did not say you weren affected mister spock you are perfectly healthy that is for any normal vulcan on the high side of hundred
captain can go back to my station
you feel up to it
of course do just need wee bit of rest that all he leaves with spock giving him hand
you can leave too lieutenant galway lieutenant galway
what you spoke to me doctor
yes spoke to you said that you could leave too now why don you go down to your quarters and get some sleep
no don want to sleep can you understand if sleep what will find when wake up camera finally pans over to show us an old woman with dowagers hump
lieutenant galway assume your position start your duties
thank you sir on her way out what stupid place to hang mirror
she ten years younger than am and she looks
people age normally at different speeds jim
why hasn he aged
don know
well want to know is it his youth his blood type his heritage his glands his genes
his genes all right nurse prepare chekov for another complete physical
come along ensign this won hurt much
promises
few years ago on aldebaran three my husband and tried various carbohydrate compounds to slow down the degeneration of plant life
then try that doctor wallace try anything but do it quickly
yes sir leaves
ll be on the bridge keep me posted as to chekov doctor wallace is waiting for kirk
thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab doctor
we both go in the same direction
so we do
look we know the problem we know the progress of the affliction therefore once we find the proper line of research it only logical we find the solution
you sound like my first officer
no problem is insoluble not even ours
that didn spring from logic
our situation doesn have its roots in logic the heart is not logical organ when married theodore wallace thought was over you was wrong
when did you realise that today
what
how much older was your husband than you
what difference does that make
answer me
twenty six years
that quite difference
jim he was brilliant man we were stationed on lonely outpost we were working together don want to talk about him want to talk about us
look at me look at me what do you see
see captain james kirk man of morality decency handsome and strong
and old and rapidly growing older
jim please
what are you offering me jan love or going away present
give us some more blood chekov the needle won hurt chekov take off your shirt chekov roll over chekov breathe deeply chekov blood sample chekov marrow sample chekov skin sample chekov if live long enough going to run out of samples
you ll live
oh yes ll live but won enjoy it
maintaining standard orbit captain kirk enters
increase orbit to twenty thousand perigee mister sulu
aye aye sir
blonde yeoman will you sign this sir he drops the pen she starts to stoop to pick it up
yeoman picks the pen up you have reason for being on the bridge commodore stocker
hoped for few words with you at your convenience
have very little time
if may say so sir we have due date at starbase ten
we re going to be late don intend to leave this area until we ve found the solution for this problem
captain watching four very valuable and one almost irreplaceable members of the starfleet failing before my eyes want to do something to help
yes yes if you re so concerned ll send message to starbase ten
captain you sent such message this morning
yeoman where that
sir
fuel consumption report
gave it to you you signed it
if signed it wouldn have asked for it now would
your signature captain later everyone is tip-toeing around an obviously sleeping captain in his comfy chair spock enters unaware
captain believe notices and wakes him gently captain captain
mister spock was just thinking
yes sir quite understandable
you have something to report
yes sir we have the cause of the affliction
what is it
the orbit of gamma hydra four carried the planet directly through the comet trail on conventional radiation settings we discovered nothing on resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale undetected radiation appeared below normal radiation levels but definitely present and undoubtedly residue from the comet
good spock well done let get this to doctor mccoy immediately oh lieutenant take message to starfleet command due to the proximity of the romulans you better use code two
but captain the romulans have broken code two if you remember the last bulletin
then use code three
yes sir code three
message key to affliction may be comet which passed by gamma hydra four said comet is now
consulting padd quadrant four four eight sir
quadrant all units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it comet is highly dangerous kirk commanding enterprise immediately lieutenant let go
aye sir
oh mister sulu increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee
you mean another twenty thousand captain
fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned now do as you re told mister sulu
mister sulu what is our present position
orbiting at twenty thousand sir
maintain
maintaining sir
radiation that as good an answer as any but why didn we know about it earlier
possibly doctor because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before
to wallace run this through doctor
all right bones going up to the bridge keep me posted spock
have question for the doctor kirk leaves doctor the ship temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me ve adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees which is at least tolerable however
well see not going to be making any house calls on you
wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold
not magician spock just an old country doctor
yes as always suspected leaves
doctor mccoy none of our usual radiation therapies will have any effect on this radiation sickness
well then we just start over that all we work harder faster and we start completely from scratch if we have to but we find something
spock can have word with you
commodore
mister spock starship can function with chief engineer chief medical officer even first officer under physical par but it disastrous to have commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection
am aware of that
please understand me my admiration for captain kirk is unbounded he is great officer but mister spock need your help and your co-operation
for what sir
would like you to take over command of the enterprise
on what grounds commodore
on the grounds that the captain because of his affliction is unable to perform his duties
need remind you sir that too have contracted the same affliction
yes but you re vulcan you have much greater life span you show the affects to much smaller degree
half human sir my physical reflexes are down my mental capacity is reduced tire easily no sir am not fit for command
well if you are not with your vulcan physique then obviously captain kirk cannot be
sir do have duties to perform
mister spock do not like what about to say but regulations demand it and as starfleet flag officer must follow regulations as second in command of the enterprise you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing
resist that suggestion commodore
it not matter of choice when captain is unfit physically or mentally competency hearing is mandatory please don make me quote regulation which you know as well as do
very well sir the hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours chekov is back on the biobed
now this isn going to hurt bit
that what you said the last time
did it hurt
yes
doctor she collapses in kirk arms
bones
she dead her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us but the same thing going to happen to us unless
how long have we got bones
oh matter of days perhaps hours
let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by commodore stocker and reluctantly called by myself
let it also read that consider it invalid
mister spock may make statement have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the starfleet have tried to convince captain kirk of the necessity of proceeding to starbase ten but ve been overruled in each case the responsibility of this hearing is mine
on the contrary commodore as presiding officer and as second in command of the enterprise the responsibility is mine captain kirk would you like to make statement
yes would like to make statement am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her let call this whole thing off and get back to work
it is quite impossible captain the regulations are quite specific you are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them
very kind of you spock
mister sulu how long have you served with captain kirk
two years sir
to your knowledge has he ever had any difficulty making decisions
no sir
did he order you to maintain standard orbit around gamma hydra four
yes sir
did he not several minutes later repeat that order
yes sir
did he order you to increase orbit
yes sir
did he not several minutes later repeat that order
he did not when give an order expect it to be obeyed don have to repeat myself
mister sulu please answer the question
yes sir captain kirk repeated his order
thank you mister sulu yeoman atkins you handed captain kirk fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses which he read and signed is that correct
sir he had more important things on his mind
yeoman you will simply answer the question
guess he forgot he signed it
you guess
he forgot he signed it
thank you yeoman you may leave lieutenant uhura have here bulletin from starfleet command which states that the romulans have broken code two are these your initials which appear at the bottom
they are
and whose initials are those which appear directly below yours
those of captain kirk
did captain kirk ask you to send message about the comet which passed gamma hydra four
he did
using code two
oh yes but he changed it to code three
after you reminded him that the romulans had broken code two
yes
thank you lieutenant doctor mccoy doctor mccoy
waking up yes spock what is it
several hours ago at the request of this board you ran complete physical examination of captain kirk
did
medical banks compute described subject physical age using established norms as comparative base
working subject physical age based on physiological profile between sixty and seventy two aging rapidly
no thirty four thirty four years old
the computer differs with you captain
doctor mccoy
yes
will you give us your professional evaluation of captain kirk present physical condition
captain kirk is suffering from peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging
is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly
yes yes but he better man right now
doctor you heard the computer analysis of captain kirk physical age do you agree with it
it blasted machine spock you can argue with machine
do you agree with it doctor
yes yes do agree and am sorry jim
this board has no further questions unless you commodore stocker have something that you would like to add
no am quite satisfied mister spock
do you wish to call any witnesses captain kirk
am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence mister spock
captain would suggest
no no no it all right spock it all right there only one reason and one reason alone for having this hearing refused to leave gamma hydra two
gamma hydra four captain
yes slip of the tongue
you re inability to remember having given commands reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon all these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions
so little confused who wouldn be at time like this my ship in trouble my senior officers are ill and this nonsense about competency hearing is enough to mix up any man trying to relieve captain of his command is well that that spock wouldn have believed it of you go ahead ask me questions ll show you what capable of there nothing wrong with my memory go ahead ask me anything we re in orbit around gamma hydra two right anyhow it doesn matter there lot more to running starship than answering lot of fool questions lot more go ahead ask me questions
we have no more questions captain
ask me anything anything
there ll be no more questions captain if you would leave the room so the board can vote
good idea get this stupid voting over with so can get back to running the ship the most fool thing ever heard of competency hearing when there work to be done ll be in my quarters awaiting your decision leaves
well since the senior officers are incapable and am of flag rank am forced by regulations to assume command
sir you have never commanded starship
what would you have junior officer with far less experience than have
the danger from the romulans
mister spock we have to save these people mister sulu set direct course for starbase ten warp five
across the neutral zone
immediately mister sulu all officers are to return to their posts wallace and spock enter
spock
yes captain
so ve been relieved
sorry captain
yes you should ve been prosecuting attorney
regulations require
regulations don give me regulations you ve wanted command all along first little excuse you get
captain have not assumed command
hope you re proud of what do you mean you ve not assumed command
suffer the same affliction as you sir
if you re not in command who is
commodore stocker
stocker are you crazy he never had field command
mister scott was unfit for command commodore stocker is ranking officer
no don talk to me about rank the man chair-bound paper-pusher order you to take command
cannot captain
are you refusing direct order
no sir only commodore stocker can give command order onboard this ship
you traitorous disloyal you stab me in the back the first chance you get spock get out never want to have to look at you again spock leaves
jan jan
oh jim sorry truly am
made fool of myself in there shouldn have let them confuse me rattle me
everybody understood
but not old jan not few muscular aches doesn make man old and you don run starship with your arms you run it with your head my brain as sharp as it ever was simple case of radiation poisoning and they relieve me of my command admit getting little grey but radiation will do that to you
oh jim will you forgive me have work to do
jan you know me look at me closely tell me am getting old
what are you doing here
it would seem to be the place where can be of the most use
maybe you like to relieve doctor mccoy what about chekov
nothing absolutely nothing
bones there has to be there has to be we beamed down together we were on the surface together the same spot we were together all the time
no not all the time captain he left us for few moments
he left us he left us he went into the building spock something happened
yes yes indeed captain doctor you remember
he was scared he saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death
yes yes now that could be right scared heart beats faster breathe gets short and there cold sweats and adrenaline flows adrenal activity now hold on just minute there was something that read once it was ancient history just after the atomic age used for radiation sickness adrenaline
doctor hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness
yes yes now but before adrenaline highly promising early research but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered
quite possible doctor perhaps sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed
don just stand there jawing spock you and doctor wallace get cracking
entering romulan neutral zone sir all sensors on maximum
thank you mister sulu lieutenant uhura let me know if we contact any romulan the ship is shaken by an impact
think we just made contact sir
romulans approaching from both sides we re bracketed sir
engineering wants instructions sir
commodore stocker what are your orders commodore but he is transfixed by the sight of another weapon blast heading for them on the viewscreen
going up to the bridge
no jim you can do it
have to go to the bridge we re under attack
nurse doctor wallace
let me go
nurse
jim
easy captain
we re under attack have to go to the bridge ve got to go to the bridge but they bustle him into the ward instead
keep trying to raise the romulans
trying commodore
if could talk to them explain to them why we violated the neutral zone
the romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations
lieutenant uhura is right sir we ve tangled with them before
greenhorn up there ruining my ship
jim if have to give you shot
jim-boy you just lay quiet you can do no good we re both through
no no my ship my ship spock totters in carrying small beaker
doctor made the necessary computations and produced this serum it is crude and dangerous but we have no time for refinements
all right let let go
it could cure or kill doctor
don give me any vulcan details just give me the shot
no ll take the first shot
you can
how long do you think this ship can take the pounding ve got to get up there
jim it could kill you
ll die anyway do it
doctor wallace give him the shot
quickly quickly she does and he goes into convulsions fortunately he is already strapped down
sir they ve fired another as the enterprise continues to be battered kirk is writhing and groaning
well well what happening
the ageing process has stopped his bodily functions are getting stronger
sir ve tried all known hailing frequencies they simply ignore us
opinion mister sulu
they know they have us they know our shields will give out
well then we have no alternative but to surrender
sir the romulans do not take captives
we re losing power sir
what am going to do ve got to do something
report mister sulu
we re surrounded by romulan vessels maximum of ten range fifty to hundred thousand kilometres
engineering this is the captain want full emergency power want everything within about two minutes want the warp drive engines on full standby kirk out open up special channel to starfleet command code two
but captain code
that an order lieutenant code two
yes captain code two
message from enterprise to starfleet command this sector have inadvertently encroached upon romulan neutral zone surrounded and under heavy romulan attack escape impossible shields failing will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed since this will result in the destruction of the enterprise and all matter in two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish corresponding dead zone all federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years explosion will take place in one minute kirk commanding enterprise out mister sulu course one eight eight degrees mark fourteen speed warp factor eight stand by
standing by sir
romulans giving ground captain obviously they tapped in as you expected them to
logical assumption mister spock are they still retreating
yes sir
good all hands stand by warp factor eight now
the romulans were caught off guard captain they re falling behind
are we out of range mister sulu
yes sir and out of the neutral zone
secure from red alert adjust new course two five seven degrees mark three heading for starbase ten
two five seven degrees mark three
captain just wanted to assure you that did what thought best to save you and the men
noted you should know however that there very little starbase can do that starship can
if may say so captain am now quite aware of what starship can do with the right man at the helm mccoy enters
you re looking good doc
feeling fine so is scotty the serum worked he pulled muscle during the reaction but otherwise he feeling fine
and yourself
oh very well few bruises here and there oh anytime you re ready mister spock
am quite ready now doctor
because of your vulcan physique have prepared an extremely potent shot for you however you might like to know ve removed all the breakables from sickbay
that is very considerate of you doctor
thought you be pleased to hear that spock mccoy and stocker leave as wallace enters
well gentlemen all and all an experience we ll remember in our old age which won be for some while hope take over mister sulu steady as she goes
steady as she goes captain
thought said that kirk scott mccoy and uhura are with the local leader when lightning threatens
we believe what you say captain kirk but our position has not altered the halkan council cannot permit your federation to mine dilithium crystals on our planet
we have shown the council historical proof that our missions are peaceful
we accept that your federation is benevolent at present but the future is always in question our dilithium crystals represent awesome power wrongful use of that power even to the extent of the taking of one life would violate our history of total peace to prevent that we would die captain as race if necessary
admire your ethics and hope to prove ours kirk to enterprise
report on magnetic storm mister spock
standard ion type captain but quite violent enterprise shakes and unpredictable
rough ride
stand by to beam up landing party disturbance kirk out
comply mister sulu
aye sir
when may we resume discussion
the council will meditate further but do not be hopeful of any change captain you do have the might to force the crystals from us of course
but we won consider that enterprise transporter room energise
trouble sir four figures start to materialise then disappear again the image of enterprise in orbit reverses itself finally four figures solidify wearing strange uniforms with gold sashes uhura midriff is bare
spock was right it was rough trip spock and kyle greet their captain with semi-nazi salute their uniforms have changes and spock has grown very fetching goatee beard
at norm mister kyle controls at neutral
yes sir
status of mission captain
no change
standard procedure captain kirk nods mister sulu you will programme phaser barrage on halkan cities
their military capability captain
none
regrettable that this society has chosen suicide mister kyle you were instructed to compensate during the ion storm
but tried mister spock tried
carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated
but mister spock
your agoniser
no mister spock
your agoniser please guard restrains kyle and takes device from his belt
no mister spock tried really tried spock places the device on kyle collar bone and he writhes in agony when it is removed he collapses captain log stardate unknown during an ion storm my landing party has beamed back to the enterprise and found it and the personnel aboard changed the ship is subtly altered physically behaviour and discipline has become brutal savage
mister scott the storm has caused some minor damage in your section there are also injuries requiring your attention doctor well gentlemen
mister spock
yes
the power beam jumped for moment sir as the landing party was about to materialise never saw it happen before
due to your error mister kyle
no mister spock before
possibly result of the severe storm captain do you feel any abnormal effects
yes doctor mccoy you better look us over that was rough beam-up
yes sir
mister spock have those transporter circuits checked
captain what is all this
how did we get in these
not now not now
what is this everything all messed up and changed around out of place
captain what happened
no not everything that spot spilt acid there year ago jim what in blazes is this
don know it our enterprise but it isn maybe
maybe what captain
any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam
yes
aye
when we first materialised
did
it happened twice first we were in our own transporter chamber then we faded and then when we finally materialised we were here wherever this is
captain the transporter chief mentioned surge of power the transporter lock might have been affected by the ion storm and we just materialised somewhere else
yes here not our universe not our ship something parallel parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane everything duplicated almost another enterprise spock with beard
another captain kirk another doctor mccoy another
an exchange if we re here
then our counterparts must have been transporting up at the exact same time similar storms on both universes disrupted the circuits we re here and they re on our enterprise probably asking the same questions are we in another universe and if so how do we get back to our own they ll use the computer and we have to
what about the halkans we can let them be destroyed
scotty can you buy me some time get below and short out the main phaser couplings they ll think the storm blew the stand-by circuits
aye sir
then get on this technology it all we have to work with if we want to get back home the intercom may be monitored use your communicators for private messages subfrequency and scramble
aye sir scott leaves
lieutenant
yes sir
get to your post run today communication from starfleet command want to know my exact orders and options if any
yes sir
bones
captain
uhura you re the only one who can do it ll be right there
yes sir she leaves
bones let take look at the library we have lot to learn
mister chekov phaser setting for planetary target
co-ordinates seven one two stroke four mister sulu
port batteries locked uhura enters and goes to her station sulu goes over to her he has very nasty scar down his face
still no interest uhura hmm could change your mind
you are away from your post mister
is the captain here is spock here when the cat away she slaps his hand away then kirk enters everyone salutes him
communications status
no storm damage sir all stations report normal quietly you re ordered to annihilate the halkans unless they comply no alternative
phasers locked on target captain approaching optimum range commence fire captain captain
stand by mister sulu the door opens and burly guard blocks scott entrance
ve been ordered to check phaser couplings for possible damage by the storm
do you have authorisation from security sir
captain orders
ll have to check with security chief sulu sir
never mind ll attend to it he goes to an intercom
kirk here
phaser report sir no damage
very good thank you mister scott kirk out spock enters the bridge
planet rotation is carrying primary target beyond arc of phaser lock
shall correct orbit to new firing position
no
lock on to secondary city
aye sir
lieutenant uhura contact the halkan council wish to talk to them again
yes sir
captain
this is new race they offer other things of value besides dilithium crystals
but we cannot expect their co-operation they have refused the empire command procedure dictates that we provide the customary example
secondary target now moving beyond our phaser lock
put phasers on standby mister sulu
serious breach of orders captain
have my reasons and ll make them clear to you in my own good time
captain have the leader on the halkan council waiting on channel
it is useless to resist us
you have twelve hours to consider your position we are ethically compelled to deny your demand for our dilithium crystals for you would use their power to destroy
we will level your planet and take what we want that is destruction you will die as race
we will not argue twelve hours no more close communications turn phasers off
aye sir
twelve hours captain that is unprecedented
shall be in my quarters lieutenant uhura have doctor mccoy and mister scott meet me there chekov presses couple of buttons on his console then leaves his post
captain you ve placed yourself in most grave position this conduct must be reported
you re at liberty to do so mister spock
deck five sir as kirk leaves the lift someone punches him in the face and he is grabbed
holding phaser on kirk so you die captain and we all move up in rank no one will question the assassination of captain who has disobeyed prime orders of the empire captain log supplemental command an enterprise where officers apparently employ private henchmen among the crew where assassination of superiors is common means of advancing in rank suddenly one of chekov men turns against him taking his weapon and shooting another kirk throws his final assailant and he gets zapped into molecules too the turbolift opens and two armed men come out
your men captain easy farrell did your job ask the captain
sir
yes he did your job
smart boy switching to the top dog
get him out of here
mister chekov was going to make me chief you could make me an officer
all right you re working for me
commission
you re in line you might even make captain
yes sir kirk punches him
not on my ship
the booth for this one sir
yes the booth carry on chekov is taken away the three men enter warily
here here what this
it called blood watch your step the officers move up by assassination chekov tried it on me
mister sulu is security chief like the ancient gestapo
and my sickbay is chamber of horrors my assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man how long it would take him to pass out from the pain
report on technology
mostly variations in instrumentation nothing can handle
star readings
everything exactly where it should be except us
let find out where we stand computer
male voice ready
this is the captain record security research to be classified under my voice print or mister scott
recorded
produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm correlate following hypothesis could storm of such magnitude cause power surge in the transporter circuits creating momentary interdimensional contact with parallel universe
affirmative
at such moment could persons in each universe in the act of beaming transpose with their counterparts in the other universe
affirmative
could conditions necessary to such an event be created artificially using the ship power
affirmative
record procedure scotty can you do it
not by myself ll need help and you be too conspicuous
doctor not an engineer
now you re an engineer ll have to tap the power we need from the warp engines and balance it for the four of us
jim the way this ship is run what kind of people are we in this universe
let find out computer
ready
read out official record of current command
captain james kirk succeeded to command iss enterprise through assassination of captain christopher pike first action suppression of gorlan uprising through destruction of rebel home planet second action execution of five thousand colonists on vega nine
cancel now we know
captain we can do it
good
we have to lay in the automatic transporter setting but when we interrupt engine circuits to tie the power increase into the transporter it ll show up on sulu security board of course we ll only need second
ll tell uhura to create diversion to distract sulu at your signal let get back to our posts keep me advised
jim if we re here what do you suppose our counterparts doing back in our universe
on our enterprise furious duplicate captain is being manhandled along the corridor by two security guards and thrown into the brig uhura scott and mccoy are already there
order you let me go traitors spock get these men off me what is this
what are you doing spock
you traitorous pig ll hang you up by your vulcan ears ll have you all executed
think not your authority on this ship is extremely limited captain the four of you will remain her in the brig and in custody until discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong
has the whole galaxy gone crazy what kind of uniform is this where your beard what going on where my personal guard
can answer none of your questions at this time
all right spock whatever your game is ll play it you want credits ll give them to you you ll be rich man command of your own can swing that too
apparently some kind of transposition has taken place find it extremely interesting
spock what is it that will buy you power
fascinating
power spock can get that for you
captain am pleased that you frustrated mister chekov plan should regret your death
why
do not desire the captaincy much prefer my scientific duties am frankly content to be lesser target
logical as always mister spock they arrive at cylinder containing chekov who is writhing in agony
the agony booth is most effective means of discipline presume you ve ordered full duration
haven decided
indeed his act warrants death
said haven decided
that is of course your affair captain may inquire if you intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the halkans they continue walking farrell joins spock personal guard walking behind his master
you heard my orders
they are of course in contradiction to standard empire procedure you cannot ignore the consequences
is that threat
do not threaten captain merely state facts have found you to be an excellent officer our missions together have been both successful and profitable however shall not permit your aberrations to jeopardise my position
spock do you think we should destroy the halkans
terror must be maintained or the empire is doomed it is the logic of history
conquest is easy control is not we may have bitten off more than we can chew
captain do not wish to find myself opposing you but if you continue on your present course this confusing inexplicable behaviour
is my concern not yours you would find me formidable enemy
aware of that captain trust that you are aware of the reverse spock and his bodyguard leave
orders sir
release chekov confine him to quarters
yes sir scott distracts the guard outside the door so mccoy can give him hypo
that ought to hold him for about six hours they go to the upper level and scott begins his work the room is dark and woman is lying on his bed
fell asleep we had quite time in the chem lab picking up after the storm nothing compared to your day gather heard about chekov
he gambled won
you got lucky surprised you could be caught off-guard that way
was preoccupied
you re still in trouble with starfleet command what you ve got in mind this time is beyond me you re scheming of course the halkans have something you want or is it all some clever means to advance you to the admiralty kirk the cabinet itself
further than that if successful
really well you must know what you re doing you always do if to be the woman of caesar can know what you re up to their kiss is interrupted by the intercom
kirk here
mister spock captain
have received private communication from starfleet command am committing breach of regulations by informing you of its contents
yes mister spock
am instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission
and if don
in that event am ordered to kill you and to proceed against the halkans as the new captain of the enterprise captain log stardate unknown we are trapped in savage parallel universe from which we must escape within four hours or will face death sentence at mister spock hands
let drink toast to spock the only man aboard with the decency to warn you and he ll die for it they ll never find another man like him
don intend to kill him
are you going to act against the halkans before the deadline
no but ll avoid killing spock
just get him out of the way he and his men
ll get out of his way
shall activate the tantalus field you ll at least want to monitor him won you
yes she touches wall panel and it rises to reveal screen and collection of buttons
hate this thing
it not that bad
of course not it made you captain how many enemies have you simply wiped out of existence by the touch of button fifty hundred now always thought that was funny the great powerful captain kirk who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and plundered laboratory
well if you don take advantage of your opportunities
you don rise to the command of starship or even higher she switches it on and spock is seen sitting at his table
that magnificent mind of his but it can protect him from this press it and he dies now kirk switches it off
you really mean it it doesn matter if spock fails his order he ll be killed anyway
ll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him
you re not even afraid of starfleet command can your scheme bring you that much power so quickly and what about me how does marlena fit in
how does marlena want to fit in she goes into the other room
scotty
scotty here sir
we have to get out of here within three hours spock has orders to kill me unless complete the mission
we ve got another deadline too sir
the two-way matter transmission affected the local field density between the universes and it increasing we ve got to move fast
how fast
half hour at the most
if we miss bridge power from the engines to the transporter
you ve got to get down there and free the board so we can lock in give me about ten minutes computations
all right ll be in the transporter room in ten minutes ll meet you in sickbay afterward
aye sir
computer
ready
explain computer activity in the engineering section
security research is in progress
who is conducting the research
the captain and mister scott
what is the nature of the research
programme is classified under voice index log big red light starts flashing
why are you monitoring my communications mister sulu
my security board has detected extensive use of computer mister spock was about to inform you your order from starfleet command suggest connection the captain suspects
he working on escape or defence
that is my concern
correct it your play hope you succeed because the order would fall on me next and you know how captain kirk enemies have habit of disappearing
if am successful you see yourself step nearer to the captaincy do not want to command the enterprise but if it should befall me suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are vulcans marlena has changed into something more comfortable
oiling my traps darling afraid little out of practice maybe that what happened to us it very hard for working officer to shine as woman every minute and you demand perfection
ve never seen perfection but no woman could come closer to it
remember when you used to talk that way
still do
prove it
ve got to go
ship business an important task on the crew deck well guess it over commander kenno will take me temporarily he made that quite clear ll call yeoman to help me with my things
you don have to do that
are you feeling sorry for me do see hesitation in your eyes about anything want one thing captain transfer me on the enterprise am humiliated on another ship can hunt fresh game ve got my rank and don ve been captain woman and like it ll be one again if have to go through every officer in the fleet
you could she turns to slap him simply meant that you could be anything you want to be they kiss long and passionate
it been long time since you ve kissed me like that you re stranger mercy to the halkans mercy to spock to me am your woman
you re the captain woman until he says you re not she turns on the tantalus machine and watches him go into turbolift
uhura
scotty signal should be coming through any moment you know what to do
keep sulu attention off that board
good luck kirk out scott is up jefferies tube he signals uhura
you aren very persistent mister sulu the game has rules you re ignoring them protest and you come back you didn come back
wrapping his arms around her naked waist now you re making sense
was getting bored of course this isn the time the board beeps
any time good time she slaps him hard
afraid changed my mind again
you take lot of chances lieutenant
drawing her dagger so do you mister so do you take over for me she goes into the turbolift and guards block sulu way
mister scott all clear on my way to sickbay
now it up to the captain
please restrict your movements captain
what are you doing are you going to shoot me now spock thought had until dawn
shall make that decision since your return from the planet you ve behaved in most atypical and illogical manner want to know why
shoot you re wasting time
shall not waste time with you you re too inflexible too disciplined once you ve made up your mind but doctor mccoy has plenitude of human weaknesses sentimental soft you may not tell me what want to know but he will
you re running big risk spock
have the phaser captain and do not intend to simply disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past if you please sickbay
yes of course the entire landing party captain stand over there doctor it is time for answers kirk knocks the phaser out of spock hand and he and scott try to fight him even uhura gets pushed around finally she hands kirk skull and he smashes it over spock head he falls unconscious
how much time scotty
hardly fifteen minutes sir the field density between the two universes is starting to close very fast
help me get him on the table well come on help me get him on the table he ll die without immediate treatment
everything laid in scotty the time lag so the operator can get into the transporter chamber
all laid in sir come on mccoy we re taking chance of not getting back home
we ll get home this won take long {marlena is still watching on the tantalus screen
do you want me to stop jim it ll only take minute
he is very much like our own mister spock isn he you ve got that minute sulu and three henchmen march in
what is this mister sulu
mister spock has orders to kill you captain he will succeed apparently you will also appear to have killed him after fierce battle regrettable but it will leave me in command then one of the henchmen disappears and another marlena presses the button again and sulu is alone kirk disarms and knocks him out easily
captain we ve barely got ten minutes
let go bones
can let him die jim you get on to the transporter room ll be there in five minutes
no longer
guarantee it now go on please kirk scott and uhura leave mccoy gives spock an injection
sitting up and grabbing mccoy arm why did the captain let me live he pushes him against the wall and does mind meld
our minds are merging doctor our minds are one feel what you feel know what you know marlena is waiting for them
friend activate the transporter you saved us back at sickbay with the tantalus field
take me with you
can sorry our power is balanced for four there no guarantee that we ll make it with five all could die scotty
it working sir
but there are only three of you
one is coming help you if could marlena believe that she raises her phaser
if you kill us you ll still stay uhura disarms marlena
where mccoy time scotty
five minutes sir
do you know what they ll do to me
the power cut sir they re on to us
auxiliary
aye it available
can you bridge to your setup
can get us the power but the automatic setting is linked to the transporter main if we bypass that means that someone has got to operate the controls manually
one of us will have to stay
ll stay captain
get to the transporter chamber you too uhura
jim
that an order scotty
aye captain
what about me
mccoy spock enters with mccoy
cut the transporter power it was necessary to delay your beam-out until could arrive take him scott guides mccoy to the transporter pad
engineering re-activate main transporter circuits
you re man of integrity in both universes mister spock
you must return to your universe must have my captain back shall operate the transporter you have two minutes and ten seconds
in that time have something to say how long before the halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised
approximately two hundred and forty years
the inevitable outcome
the empire shall be overthrown of course
the illogic of waste mister spock the waste of lives potential resources time submit to you that your empire is illogical because it cannot endure submit that you are illogical to be willing part of it
you have one minute and twenty three seconds
if change is inevitable predictable beneficial doesn logic demand that you be part of it
one man cannot summon the future
but one man can change the present be the captain of this enterprise mister spock find logical reason for sparing the halkans and make it stick push till it gives you can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet
captain get in the chamber
what about it spock
man must also have the power
in my cabin is device that will make you invincible
indeed
what will it be past or future tyranny or freedom it up to you
it is time
in every revolution there one man with vision
captain kirk shall consider it he beams them away back on the proper enterprise in the right uniforms
spock
welcome home captain
what don understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly
it was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men assume they returned to their enterprise at the same time you appeared here
probably however that jim kirk will find few changes if read my spocks correctly
jim think liked him with beard better it gave him character of course almost any change would be distinct improvement
what worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe always thought spock was bit of pirate at heart
indeed gentlemen may point out that had an opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely they were brutal savage unprincipled uncivilised treacherous in every way splendid examples of homo sapiens the very flower of humanity found them quite refreshing
not sure but think we ve been insulted
sure women steps out of the turbolift
captain kirk
lieutenant er lieutenant
marlena moreau was just assigned last week
all right lieutenant carry on
you ve met her before captain
uh why do you ask
your reaction one of recognition
oh no no no we haven met before exactly she just seemed nice likable girl think we could become friends it possible and to prove it he leaves his chair and goes over to stand next to her captain log stardate 3211 we are entering standard orbit about gamma two an uninhabited planetoid with an automatic communications and astrogation station
ensign chekov lieutenant uhura and will beam down and make routine check of its facilities
standard orbit captain
good mind the store mister spock
acknowledged captain
lieutenant uhura let go
yes sir
energise scotty
aye captain but before he can touch the controls the landing party vanish abruptly the three appear lying on the ground on decorated surface there are iron railings around vaguely triangular area and three benches one on each side
captain what happened
it must be transporter malfunction
that was rough trip
this isn gamma two look at the colour of that sky it green
this is the craziest landing pad ve ever seen
that trinary sun
scott to bridge
spock here
mister spock the captain lieutenant uhura and chekov they vanished they got onto the transporter platform and they just vanished
presume you mean they vanished in manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter mister scott
aye of course mean that you think call if they just beamed down
have you reversed controls
ve made all the proper checks there was nothing there was no flash of light nothing they were gone
power surge
not down here all the dials were right and the transporter was functioning perfectly
recheck your equipment mister scott ll scan for them on the planet surface spock out
but captain if we re not on gamma two then where are we
that what like to know kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise dead
mine too
captain look people are approaching them one big guy in fur with teeth that hold his mouth open another male with knife female in pink carrying lance-like weapon and another in silver with green hair
phasers on stun fire nothing happens hand-to-hand the men go one-on-one while uhura has to deal with both women simultaneously they are not fairly matched chekov cannot handle the giant and uhura quickly gives up only kirk acquits himself well against the normal male until green-hair intervenes with her weapon captain log stardate 3211 while beaming down from the enterprise to inspect facilities on gamma two the normal transporter sequence has been interrupted and we find ourselves on strange and hostile planet surrounded by creatures belonging to races scattered all through the galaxy thin bald male in long black cloak pops into the scene
excellent captain kirk although we expected strength and competitive spirit we are greatly pleased
either of you hurt
don think so captain
nobody hurt captain yet
admirable chekov admirable you also uhura your spirit is as great as the captain can see you all will prove invaluable here am galt master thrall of the planet triskelion have been sent to welcome you all three are fastened securely to the wall and have collars around their necks
there captain now you are prepared for your training
how do you know our names
the providers were expecting you captain they arranged your transportation
these providers of yours are they
correction captain the providers are not ours we are theirs
what do they want from us
you are to be trained of course what other use is there for thralls
thralls you must be mistaken we re officers of united spaceship on federation business
there has been no mistake your old titles mean nothing here captain you are thralls now you are to be taken to the training enclosure the restraints are released come places have been prepared for you
we re not going anywhere until we have some information who are you what is this place what do you think you re going to do with us
am galt the master thrall this place is the planet triskelion you are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives here
mister spock ve checked that transporter from one end to the other every circuit works perfectly whatever that power surge was it had nothing to do with the transporter or any other system aboard this ship
beginning to believe that mister scott ve conducted two sweeps of the planet surface there is no sign of life
then what the devil is happening does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there
no doctor even that would show up on our sensors
where are they then
the only answers are negative no magnetic storms no ionic interference no breakdown in your equipment
negative attitude is no good to us we can just leave them out there wherever they are
we shall continue sensor scans doctor at the moment that is all we can do except hope for rational explanation
hope always thought that was human failing mister spock
true doctor constant exposure does result in certain degree of contamination curved corridor with doors off on either side the doors have iron bars in the upper half
these are your quarters open thralls as the doors slide open chekov and kirk hit their minders and they all run galt eyes glow the collars glow and the starfleet escapees collapse choking
that was foolish captain escape is quite impossible as demonstrated by your collars of obedience return to your quarters they do and they are left alone
they are not within the confines of this solar system
it been nearly an hour can people live that long as disassembled atoms in transporter beam
have never heard of study being done but it would be fascinating project
fascinating those people are friends of ours out there if they re still alive
precisely
the odds are not good
no would say approximately four hundred
don quote odds and don give me anymore dispassionate logic mister spock just keep looking for them
would welcome suggestion doctor even an emotional one as to where to look
first time you ve ever asked me for anything and it has to be an occasion like this
captain the enterprise they will be trying to find us won they
they ll try but where do they look we re here and we don know where it is
this system star is trinary limits it bit but we re long way from the enterprise if we re in the same dimension the male goes to uhura cell with tray
am your drill thrall am called lars
what do you want from her
that is not your concern your drill thralls will attend you presently he opens uhura door and goes in there is little time the shadow play tells all we need to know and the screams
lieutenant are you all right uhura lieutenant lieutenant are you all right lieutenant answer me lieutenant what happening to lieutenant uhura lieutenant are you all right
it is not allowed to refuse selection he leaves uhura clothes are intact
to kirk step away from the door she enters with tray come it is the nourishment interval
captain log stardate 3259 first officer spock in command the captain lieutenant uhura and ensign chekov have been missing for nearly two hours computer probability projections are useless due to insufficient data
woman in gold uniform at spock station mister spock getting fluctuating energy reading on this hydrogen cloud it faint sir but it consistently reads an excess of predictable energy level
interesting it seems to be an ionisation trail
what would account for that spock
exactly the question have just fed to the computers doctor and the answer is nothing known to us would account for it
well the transporter has neither the power nor the range to account for that
plot follow course ensign haines
now in chekov seat aye sir
you re going to leave here without them and run off on some wild goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because you found discrepancy in hydrogen cloud
doctor am chasing the captain lieutenant uhura and ensign chekov not some wild aquatic fowl this is the only lead we ve had
course plotted and laid in mister spock three ten mark two four one
initiate warp factor two the robust woman in pink brings him his tray she smiles at him
you you have been selected for me
with deep voice no am only your drill thrall have brought you nourishment it is nice name chee-koo
chekov
chee-koof it is very nice name am called tamoon
nervous of her intentions oh pleased pleased to know you miss
you are fine specimen like you better than the others will instruct you well so my provider will take you
that very kind of you miss but
if my provider is pleased we may even be selected for each other
didn realise was so hungry whatever you call this it is very good
it is nourishment we call it that
nourishment that very practical what do you call this collar
it is sign of our provider by the colour of the lights it can be known who holds us when you are vended you will also have colour
vended you mean bought sold
when you are developed the provider who offers the most quatloos puts his colour on us
our race has another name for it slavery this collar of obedience is galt the only one who can operate it
it is only to warn and punish
how does he work it
it is not permitted to talk of that
will you provide all my nourishment
of course am your drill thrall will train you well
yes sure you will must say ve never seen top sergeant who looked like you
what does that mean
it means you re very beautiful woman
what is beautiful
you mean nobody ever told you that before well er beautiful is beautiful he holds up the tray so she can see her reflection that beautiful shahna where were you born
born have been here always
your parents where are they your mother and father
she who bore me was killed in freestyle match
freestyle
you will learn all these things
lars and chekov drill thrall they weren born here where do they come from
it is not permitted gong sounds and red light flashes the exercise interval this is your training harness put it on
this is ridiculous there nothing out there nothing at all
we certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector
projecting back along the path of ionisation the nearest system is two four alpha
that must be two dozen light years away
eleven point six three zero
are you suggesting that they could have transported over distance of you re out of your vulcan mind spock
suggesting nothing doctor am merely pursuing the only logical course available to us the three are learning how to fight with the long poles with the curved hook on one end and grapple on the other galt enters with another thrall his hands tied behind him
hold this thrall was slow in obeying command for his punishment he will be practice target as you charge you will strike the practice target when you pass you begin uhura
no
it is not allowed to refuse training exercise
don care whether it allowed or not will not do it
none of us will do it galt
it is part of your training the providers wish it
the devil with the providers
cossacks galt gives them reminder of what their collars do
we have been tolerant because you are newcomers but see you must be given lesson lars lars unties the thrall kloog kloog will administer correction uhura take your place on the triad lars starts to tie uhura hands behind her back tie her
no no am responsible for the actions of my people demand to see the providers
it is not permitted but captain since you assume responsibility for your people you will take the punishment it is less painful than the collar turn around {lars ties kirk hands captain you will be practice target it is shame to lose you captain but it is worth it as an example to the others captain log supplemental stardate unknown our strange captivity continues this planet is called triskelion we do not know its location we do not know who controls it its dangers are abundantly clear kloog the big silent one has whip and net which kirk is trying to dodge his back is bloody and his shirt is torn but he manages to land good kick on kloog
hold rest interval fifteen trisecs the two combatants join their comrades on the benches
he pretty fast with that whip
this will strengthen you drink it kloog left eye is weak approach him from that side
resume places kirk carries on dodging the whip whilst loosening his bonds finally he manages to get his hands in front of him jump on kloog back and try to strangle him kloog falls to the ground
we hold provider one
after pause two thousand quatloos are bid is there challenge the newcomers have been vended to provider one
we re free people we belong to no one destroyed galt eyes go bright and the badges on the collars turn red
you now bear the mark of fine herd but must warn you any further disobedience now that you are full-fledged thralls will be punishable by death
mister spock it just doesn make sense they could have come this far if there any chance at all it is to continue to search in the area they were lost
we searched the area
it always possible to miss something
such as failure in the transporter mechanism
no sir there was no sign of failure
there was no sign of them in the area of gamma two
if they weren there it ridiculous to think they could still be alive not after all this time
in that case doctor we have nothing to lose by pursuing our present course shahna has taken kirk for run
slow down slow down wait minute wait minute we ve covered over two miles can we take breather rest
not at all out of breath oh very well you are tired
oh well it good to get away from that development area even for while shahna why do the providers why do they like to watch others being hurt killed
that is the way
their voices sound mechanical are they computers
computers
you ve seen them do they have bodies
not such as ours
what is this place
it is not used
it very old does it have name shahna could it have been city for the providers
do not think it is well to ask such things
they do have bodies or did have
one does not talk of such things
very pretty country very much like my home planet earth
planet stands close to her back hands on her shoulders so he can whisper in her ear
where was born shahna don you ever look at the night sky the lights up there
have looked at them
well those are stars and around them are planets and there are people that live on them just like us
how can one live on flicker of light
from earth triskelion three suns are just flicker of light actually this is the darkest planet ve ever seen
dark but all is lighted here the chambers
the thralls have no freedom shahna you don think or do anything but what the providers tell you
what else would one do
love for one thing
what is love
love is the most important thing on earth especially to man and woman
we too have mates when it is time to increase the herd my provider will select one for me
on earth we select our own mate someone we care for on earth men and women live together help each other make each other happy
do not think your words are allowed
all right all right tell me about the providers what do they look like where do they live
have never seen them but they are said not to be like us they stay in her collar lights up and kirk holds her tight while she writhes in pain
stop it stop it responsible made her talk stop it you re killing her she did nothing wrong it was my fault if you want to punish someone punish me please but it has no value here you present many interesting aspects captain but you must learn obedience then you will be an excellent thrall shahna collar stops glowing
it all right it all right you can stop crying now shahna it all right
you risked bringing their anger on yourself why did you do it
it the custom of my people to help one another when we re in trouble he kisses her
and this is this also helping
you could call it that
please help me once again another kiss did not know it could be like this between people is it always so in the place you come from
popping out of thin air captain you do indeed present many surprises because you have amused the providers there will be no punishment return to your quarters
mister scott can we manage anything faster than warp six
it my opinion that we ve gone too far as it is sir
he right spock we ve lost jim and the others on gamma two now you ve dragged us dozen light years on some wild hunch that
doctor do not respond to hunches no transporter malfunction was responsible for the disappearance they were not within the gamma system focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed into the gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching no known natural phenomena could have caused that beam does that clarify the situation
no it doesn it still fancy way of saying that you re playing hunch well my hunch is that they re back on gamma two dead or alive and still want another search
doctor mccoy speaks for me too sir
see pause gentlemen am in command of this vessel and we shall continue on our present course conspiratorial whisper unless it is your intention to declare mutiny
mister spock
who said anything about mutiny you stubborn pointed-eared all right if we don find them here do we still have another search on gamma two
agreed mister scott could you manage warp seven
would be more than content to do so sir and maybe wee bit more
ensign warp seven shahna brings nourishment tray
you re disturbed about what happened today
yes you have made me feel strangely if it were allowed would ask that you have another drill thrall
wouldn like that shahna wouldn like that at all he kisses her then punches her to knock her out
sorry shahna takes the magnetic key and unlocks his door kirk opens chekov cell tamoon is bound and gagged
this is going to kill our romance they let uhura out
what about lars
he gone to report me said didn like the food
think galt is the only one who controls these collars if we can find the phaser that threw at lars we can use the circuits to short out these collars
pointing to an exit captain galt appears and punishment is administered one stimulating
standard orbit
sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the planet on the lower hemisphere humanoid readings
well at least that gives our landing force starting point
there will be no landing force doctor assuming the captain and the others are still alive it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down large contingent
well we re not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait
interesting no power source it may be shielded
and it may be just wild goose chase like we ve been telling you
shall beam down doctor if am unable to communicate landing party may be necessary
well mister spock if you re going into the lion den you ll need medical officer
daniel as recall had only his faith but welcome your company doctor mister scott you ll be in command
aye sir but the turbolift doors shut before spock and mccoy can leave the bridge and the lights start flashing operate
spock spock
welcome to triskelion gentlemen you have been expected
what the voice said was true sir nothing is functioning whereabouts of your companions is noteworthy for all their needs the term is easier for their limited mental abilities to comprehend
providing for all their needs means using thralls people stolen from other parts of the galaxy gamble on the winner
fascinating ways
but you are afraid collar
then show yourselves it is vast obviously constructed with ceiling lights and power plant in the background in the foreground is transparent dome with three yellow brains in it
the power source shielded by solid rock beneath the surface
primary mental evolution incredible humanoid form but we evolved beyond it intellectual pursuits we became the physically simple mentally superior creatures you see before you
species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior mentally or otherwise athletic competitions our only challenge the only thing which furnishes us with purpose
it an unproductive purpose unworthy of your intellect
we have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development perhaps you re not as evolved as you believe are most challenging stimulate our stock of thralls how unfortunate that you must be destroyed
our destruction will result only in your own you may control the enterprise but you cannot match the force of the entire federation communications with your base will be possible your fate will remain mystery to your people
and you call yourselves superior you re murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take
my people pride themselves on being the greatest most successful gamblers in the universe we compete for everything power fame women everything we desire and it is our nature to win and for proof offer you our exploration of this galaxy
well then wager that with weapons of your own choice right here and now my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us elimination
wait wait hear me we can wager for trifles like quatloos the stakes must be higher
if we win the enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety further more all the thralls on the planet must be freed
you will educate and train them to establish normal self-governing culture
we have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy are you willing to admit that we can do something you can
if we lose we will remain here the entire crew of the enterprise the most stubborn determined competitors in the universe we ll become thralls enter your games obey your orders without rebellion you ll be assured of generations of the most exciting wagering you ve ever had
not for true gamesters
name it we suggest you alone pitted against three contestants of our choosing
three against one those are pretty high odds
your your terms are unfair alternative is death
well in that case ll accept your terms lars has net kloog has his whip and an andorian has the pole weapon same as kirk be permitted to watch the outcome of the game on the ship viewscreen
mister spock look you will take the yellow touching an opposing colour deprives contestant of one weapon an opponent must be killed to be removed from the game if only wounded he is replaced by fresh thrall is that clear captain
yes that clear
what in the name of heaven is this
heaven got very little to do with this so the fight begins and everyone puts their feet outside their allotted colours from time to time kirk manages to trip up or push over each of his three opponents several times eventually he throws his pole into kloog belly then picks up dagger to defend himself with lars traps his hand in the net but kirk ducks as the andorian throws his pole now the two fight with just the daggers until kirk throws the andorian galt sees that he is only injured and orders in his replacement
shahna she enters the area with pole
you lied everything you said she trips him but he grabs the pole and pulls her down to the point of his dagger they both hesitate break free and she gets him at her mercy again there is hesitation so kirk uses his legs to grab her and this time puts the blade firmly to her throat
the thralls surrender kirk lets her go of the wager will be honoured you are free remove your collars they come off easily
the thralls will be trained
think you ll find it much more exciting game than the one you ve been playing sorry shahna didn lie did what was necessary someday hope you ll understand
understand little you will leave us now
yes
to go back to the lights in the sky
yes
would like to go to those lights with you take me
can
then teach me how and will follow you
there so much you must learn here first the providers will teach you learn it shahna all your people must learn before you can reach for the stars shahna he gives her farewell kiss scotty
beam us up they disappear in twinkle
goodbye jim kirk will learn and watch the lights in the sky and remember the enterprise is gliding past red planet towards blue one
passing outer planet zeon
we want the inner one ekos plot standard orbit mister chekov and take us in
aye sir
lieutenant uhura raise john gill on starfleet communications
aye aye sir
starfleet been trying for six months if he alive isn it unlikely that he receive us now
don know bones we re here to find out what happened because don know
never met john gill but studied earth history from the text he prepared
knew him very well he was my instructor at the academy
what impressed me most was his treatment of earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events
captain no response on any starfleet channel
spacecraft approaching from inner planet
from ekos
yes but it must be zeon ship zeons do have crude interplanetary capability reaction powered small rocket it is on an intercept course that would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither zeon nor ekos should have
have you raised anyone lieutenant
nothing sir
captain it an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying warhead
stand by phasers
phasers ready
range mister chekov
two thousand kilometres closing fast
fire big ball of fire fills the viewscreen fire in vacuum never mind
fascinating thermonuclear warhead
that generations ahead of where these people should be technically how they manage that
maybe they had help maximum orbit take us out of range of their detection range
most interesting we were attacked by thermonuclear missile from planet which should have no such weapon
orbit computed and locked in sir
execute
captain no response from john gill on any channel
he must be dead and what going on down there on ekos
according to our records the ekosians are primitive warlike people in state of anarchy the other planet zeon has relatively high technology and its people are peaceful
we ve run into far more serious problem than the disappearance of john gill spock you and will beam down bones one precaution prepare subcutaneous transponder in the event we can use our communicators kirk and spock are in local dress mid/late twentieth century manual worker style including woolly hat to cover spock ears
insert the transponders make one low pass to communication range in three hours if we fail to make contact at the appointed time take our co-ordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be
aye sir whatever your condition
you ready
ready captain
energise it very quiet no people or transport
the ekosians are humanoid so there is apt to be similarity in architecture interesting man runs round the corner and trips
hide they re right behind me hide hide they do as three jack-booted soldiers surround the fallen man and kick him
zeon pig on your feet pig they are wearing armbands with swastikas on them nazi style not peaceful indian style kirk starts to move
captain the non-interference directive
hold your hands above your head zeon higher keep your hands up so you don touch anything ekosian you swine have defiled us for the last time but that now ended move they march him away
unbelievable do you recognise those uniforms
mid-twentieth century earth the nation state called nazi germany broadcast comes over screen hung between two columns of building in the street fuhrer headquarters today the fuhrer has ordered our glorious capital to be made zeon-free starting at dawn our heroic troops have begun flushing out the zeon monsters who ve been poisoning our planet
how could this have happened the chances of another planet developing culture like nazi germany using the forms the symbols the uniforms of twentieth century earth are so fantastically slim
virtually impossible captain yet the evidence is quite clear attack by zeon spacecraft our missiles utterly destroyed the enemy
you look quite well for man who been utterly destroyed mister spock melakon presented the iron cross second class to daras hero of the fatherland blonde woman everywhere preparations go forward toward the final decision death to zeon long live the fatherland long live the fuhrer the camera swings over to portrait on the studio wall
that john gill the fuhrer
fascinating
you zeons what kind of monsters are the zeons sending against us
you re right he not one of us
what do you mean
look at him kirk karate chops the soldier unconscious and takes his pistol
spock take his uniform
you propose we pass ourselves off as nazis captain
if john gill is the fuhrer it would seem the logical approach
that very well taken captain with spock in grey uniform with the obligatory tin helmet
that helmet covers multitude of sins they are accosted by man in dark blue uniform and peaked cap
lieutenant what have we here zeon
yes obviously he not one of us captured him is that not correct procedure with enemies of the fatherland
with all zeon pigs lieutenant
take charge of him
with pleasure today we have surprise planned for you zeon he steps in front of spock and gets his neck pinched of course
your uniform captain
yes it shame yours isn as attractive as mine gestapo believe
quite correct you should make very convincing nazi
lieutenant have you forgotten how to salute spock salutes your papers
your orders lieutenant he wants to see your orders in the jacket the lieutenant little dazed he captured several zeons single-handed one of the pigs struck him before he dropped promise you that pig will never get up again
good work lieutenant
hail the fuhrer
hail to the fuhrer
this is day to remember major
lieutenant better see doctor you don look well your colour
yes shall tend to it major
lieutenant your helmet remove it
we have urgent business with the fuhrer
lieutenant remove your helmet the guards at the doorway point their guns at spock head so he takes off the helmet and gives the major look kirk and spock are being whipped but they are not flinching despite the weals and blood on their skin green blood in spock case the man from the street is watching from his cell
enough do you wish to speak now tell me your orders you were sent to kill our fuhrer confess do you want some more persuasion
you re making this rather one-sided conversation major
do not joke with me zeon pig who is this alien things might go easier if you tell me about him
let me speak to your fuhrer ll tell him everything he wants to know
you ll be glad to talk to me before through
major
ah chairman eneg your excellency am honoured ve been interrogating these spies captured in
ve had full report you are not from zeon
obviously
where do you come from
ll explain when see the fuhrer
what is your business with the fuhrer
ll discuss that only with him
pig you re speaking to the chairman of the party
that enough major what were the weapons found on you what design our famous ss laboratories have been unable to discover how the weapons work
excellency give me few minutes with them promise you ll have
you ve had few minutes without result the trouble with you ss is that you don realise that punishment becomes ineffective after certain point men become insensitive
yes excellency
lock them up let their pain argue with them then will question them
excellency the standing order is to interrogate and execute the interrogation is finished therefore
finished what have you learned hold them for an hour
excellency the order
that is my order major suggest you do not disobey it
yes excellency eneg leaves all right pigs shall keep my eye on the clock when the hour is up you will die most unpleasantly promise you lock them up they are put into the cell next to the man from the street
john gill was the kindest gentlest man ever knew for him to be nazi is impossible as soon as the nazis have left the room the other man comes over to the adjoining bars
why did they take you you re not zeon he certainly is not one why do the nazis treat you as enemies
why do the nazis hate zeons
why because without us to hate there be nothing to hold them together so the party has built us into threat disease to be wiped out
is zeon threat to them
where did you come from our warlike period ended dozens of generations ago we came here we thought we were civilising the ekosians
it would seem the assumption was premature
were they like this when you first came
warlike yes but not vicious that started when the nazi movement began only few years ago
that would coincide with the time of john gill arrival
when they ve destroyed us here they will attack our planet they ll use the technology we gave them the danger is that taking life is so repugnant to our people afraid we ll go down without struggle but after what saw in the street today think could kill
do you know the plan of this building
why
if we can get to the ss weapons laboratory get our weapons back we might be able to stop the slaughter
why should you be interested in saving zeons
we must get our communicators contact the ship
captain the flaw in the plan is this locked door and the guard beyond it to the logical mind the outlook is somewhat gloomy
the transponders
yes
and way to shed some light on the gloom mister spock
of course the rubindium crystals in the transponders kirk pulls metal strip from the bed in the cell and spock uses it to cut into kirk arm
are you trying to kill yourselves spock gets kirk transponder out then kirk tries to extract spock
know it there mccoy put it in there do you have the figures computed
yes we must hold the crystals rigidly at specific distance which believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres he bends the metal strip accordingly
twenty seven point two millimetres would be approximately there that is of course crude estimation
what is it you re making some kind of radio
no not radio the power from this light is very low
yes to reach that light shall require some sort of platform
would be honoured mister spock
now the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus as recall from the history of physics the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation even using crude natural crystals kirk squats down and spock eventually stands on his thighs leaning against the well-injured back
oh mister spock the guard did professional job on my back appreciate it if you hurry
yes of course captain you realise that the aim will of course be very crude
in pain don care if you hit the broad side of barn just hurry please
captain why should aim at such structure
never mind spock just get on with the job with the crystals presumably in the holes where the strip was fastened to the bed frame spock holds it up to the light bulb and directs beam of coherent light at the door lock burning through it
oh my goodness beautiful oh spock spock spock gets down beautiful over there ll create commotion spock goes to hide behind the door to the room
help help ll talk ll talk can stand it anymore ll talk guard guard ll talk guard enters
guard ll talk ll talk the pain spock neck-pinches the guard they start to undress him
take me with you give me chance to fight them
may remind you we did not intend to fight
take me with you or you ll never find the laboratory
take him with us mister spock he got point he our guide kirk is in the uniform escorting an unshackled isak and spock
which is the laboratory door
the end of the hall the door labeled authorised personnel only not fire stairs only nazi comes out of the room and locks the door
all right zeon pigs move he stumbles against the nazi zeon pigs they do nothing right don worry they re on their way to the laboratory for experimental work they ll pay move kirk has picked the keys from the nazi pocket
move move
giving the pistol to isak cover the door spock and kirk search for their equipment
here they are the communicators disassembled can you get one to work
possibly
who are you people kirk; the phasers
do not see them
where do you come from meanwhile the nazi realises his pocket has been picked and returns weapon drawn
reading clipboard the alien pistols have been sent to gestapo command headquarters well that takes care of the phasers the nazi walks back in and isak pistol-whips him
you zeons for peaceful people are pretty thorough
yes with this uniform we can steal car get out of the capital
we came for john gill
captain without phasers and until we are able to communicate with the ship it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet
all right mister spock you ve made your point get into the uniform and hide those ears again kirk and spock are carrying stretcher out of the doors the brass plaque says service entrance
hunting good we ve caught so many zeons we ve got to dump them outside down manhole down ladder along tunnel into cave
who with you
it all right they helped me escape from the prison owe them my life
isak what is all this
abrom abrom thank god you re well this is my brother they were in the prison beaten as was abrom
why were you in their prison
was trying to see the fuhrer
the fuhrer
if can see him there may be way of stopping this insanity
abrom owe them my life
isak uletta is dead shot down in the streets
she would ve been my wife
she lived for five hours while they walked past her and spat on her our own people were unable to help her now you ask me to help strangers
if we adopt the ways of the nazis we re as bad as the nazis
captain suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators may work undisturbed somewhere
this way barrel is spock work table
by using parts from both ve completed one communicator do not know if the circuits are correct captain there is no way to test it except in actual use
the enterprise won be within range for another hour nazi with machine gun comes in abrom davod isak and others are being herded at gunpoint by the young woman from the news broadcast
over there against the wall all of you
the girl on the viewscreen
the one receiving medal
daras
quiet hands in the air zeon swine so you re the three who escaped from the chancellery detention centre what was your plan speak it the last chance you ll get
must see the fuhrer it urgent
urgent ll bet it is
alone am responsible for what happens here
do you know what we do to responsible zeons she shoots abrom and kirk grabs for her gun but is pushed off by the guard
now we finish the job she puts her pistol to kirk head
stop nazis after you ve killed the last of us off what do you do turn the guns against yourselves kirk uses the distraction to take daras pistol and use her as shield
don shoot don shoot please
no wait gets up no more you ve proved they re on our side
now please forgive us but we had to be absolutely certain
yes if we had taken you into our confidence we could ve betrayed all our people if you been nazi spies all right leave us
the gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient we must be very very careful in order to survive here we of the underground don know who our leaders are that way if we break under pressure we can only betray handful of our people
this young lady is nazi hero of the fatherland we saw her being decorated
an ekosian fighting the terrible thing that happened to my people the decoration was for betraying my own father to the party it was my father idea you see he used to be very close to the fuhrer then he saw the changes and where they were leading he turned against the party they imprisoned him melakon sentenced him to death
melakon
the deputy fuhrer he taken over
my father denounced me making it appear like betrayed him he gave me weapon to continue the fight with
how could this have seemed right to john gill
who
john gill your fuhrer he one of our people
and what is your people
captain james kirk of the united spaceship enterprise this is my first officer mister spock john gill your fuhrer was sent here by the federation as cultural observer
you mean that the fuhrer is an alien
that is correct
grew up to admire him later to hate and despise everything he stands for but always thought he was one of us now to hear that he an alien sent here to destroy us
that was not his mission ever he was sent here to observe not to interfere something went wrong and that why we re here to find out and to correct we must see him
it impossible even if this were another time it still would be impossible he sees no one no one but melakon he under maximum security
maximum security is he so afraid
there are many of us both ekosians and younger zeons who would gladly risk our lives to kill him
don understand what going on here this goes against every principle that john gill ever believed in our only chance is to see him and quickly
he makes speech tonight from the chancellery all the top party officials will be there
will you be there
of course as symbol of the proper attitude toward the fatherland
as an honoured member of the party she could get us past the guards
only the top most trusted officials will be allowed in the country will watch on the viewscreens
afraid it will be formal declaration of war against zeon their final solution
you must get us in there
it would be suicide
well it risk living at all the way things are going if the captain believes he has chance willing to commit suicide with him
you zeon you expect to get into the chancellery
it even more my fight than yours car pulls up and this time kirk and spock and isak are in black uniforms they are film crew
lights the hand held floodlight blinds the guards
you what is your business here second car arrives and kirk turns his camera on it
get me some lights on her
it party secretary daras
marching into the building the fuhrer special documentary corps smile corporal
excuse me
captain beginning to understand why you earthmen enjoy gambling no matter how carefully one computes the odds of success there is still certain exhilaration in the risk
very good spock we may make human of you yet spock; hope not
let go there bit of party going on before the speech
lights he films eneg leaving thank you where does the fuhrer enter
he doesn they watch him on the big screen there at the end of the room he broadcasts from the booth for security
they ve got the booth curtained off bring that light to the side of her face where the entrance to the broadcast booth
there at the end of the corridor you re not going to try to get into the broadcast booth
we re going to try
sir is this light better here
good
if you distract the guard long enough can get machine gun it small booth could shoot through the door
we re here to get john gill and alive not for your personal satisfaction is that clear let try down there they go down the corridor
lights please gentlemen this is for the record of the fuhrer final solution speech
we re documenting the men responsible for through small window in the door spock sees gill being wheeled into place he is motionless
smile gentlemen there will be more coverage later thank you very much let get moving shot down the hall
so what have we accomplished you should have let me shoot him
captain it was john gill but he never moved never once looked up
yes well that may be part of the plan the semi-divine detachment
or deep psychosis
it may be simpler than that he may be drugged we need mccoy is there place room we can be alone for few minutes going to send for help
send for
it takes too long to explain any place will do
the cloakroom in amongst the hangars full of uniforms spock fiddles with his home-made communicator
it may not have the range it had in fact it may not work at all
think positively spock
spock to enterprise spock to enterprise come in enterprise
captain here put mccoy on points into the low-frequency band
we ve having difficulty patch historical computer into uniform section want mccoy outfitted as gestapo doctor nazi germany old earth date 1944 make him colonel isak is socialising
search the building isak gets daras and takes her out of the room
we found john gill at least we ve seen him he may be drugged hypnotised or psychotic you ll have to make determination hurry with that uniform daras enters
what is it
isak just heard two security men they picked up your broadcast pin-pointed it within this building they re starting to search
if there going to be delay in transporting the doctor suggest we cancel our
kirk to enterprise what happening up there
doctor mccoy is having difficulty with that uniform sir
send him down naked if you have to kirk out mccoy is beamed down still trying to put boot on
it true only half-believed what you said
stupid computer made mistake in the measurements the right boot too tight
there is logical way to proceed doctor point your toe apply equal pressure to either side of the boot and push we have no time for emotionalism
this is doctor mccoy our chief medical officer daras secretary to the national socialist party
how do you do what in blazes is this eneg and two guards enter
chairman eneg
the colonel is drunk he had little too much to drink
see
yes he thought he would embarrass the fuhrer
yes doctor should have more pride
you were right to conceal him there spy in this building with secret transmitter we re conducting search hail the fuhrer
hail the fuhrer eneg and guards leave
captain do not understand how he failed to recognise us
nor do but luck is something you also fail to recognise mister spock
true shall reconsider buzzer sounds
the fuhrer speech
let go the curtain is pulled aside so gill can be seen on the screen but his mouth is hidden behind the large microphone all the people salute him
hail the fuhrer hail the fuhrer hail the fuhrer hail the fuhrer
ekosians the job ahead is difficult it requires courage and dedication it requires faith the zeon colony has existed for nearly half century
watch his mouth
if we fulfill our own greatness that will all be ended working together
captain the speech follows no logical pattern
random sentences strung together
will at times be difficult
he looks drugged jim almost at cataleptic state
to reach our goal and we will reach that goal wild applause
have to have close look at him
must be decisive every thought directed toward goal this planet can become paradise if we are willing to pay the price as each cell in the body works with discipline and harmony for the good of the entire being
to guards gentlemen want picture of you two with the hero of the fatherland listening to the stirring fuhrer speech get that light over there please get this light around here smile gentlemen turn around smile and now neck pinch and strangle hold dispose of the guards
it locked keys
hail the fuhrer
hail the fuhrer
hail the fuhrer
the fuhrer has given us our orders and we pledge him our lives in this sacred task death to zeon
death to zeon death to zeon
definitely drugged almost comatose
what drug
can identify it without medi-comp without knowing an antidote would be dangerous
is there anything you do
can give him general stimulant but it would be risky
take the risk eating away at our state
there no reaction whatever you gave him isn working
bones increase the dosage
working in the dark could kill him
if they find us here we ll all be killed
ten minutes ago on our fuhrer orders our troops began their historic mission started within an hour the zeon blight will forever be removed from ekos
it begun it finally begun
the stimulant working
he reaching level of consciousness it almost like he in light sleep now that as much as dare do disease that was zeon
spock try to get through to him with mind probe if you can bones you ll have to use stronger stimulant no matter what it does and unmanned weapons
this is the time of destiny hail victory
hail victory hail victory hail victory
there one chance left if you use the weapons you have you could destroy the fleet
that would mean the death of thousands of ekosian spacemen
many of my friends are aboard that ship many of the underground
yes but against those thousands are millions of innocent zeon lives you ve got to choose the lesser of two evils
we could save zeon but what about ekos
captain have created condition in which gill cannot initiate speech or any other action but he can reply to questions
well done spock they ve kept what left of him as figure head
quite correct for the last few years the real power has been melakon
gill gill why did you abandon your mission why did you interfere with this culture
planet fragmented divided took lesson from earth history
but why nazi germany you studied history you knew what the nazis were
most efficient state earth ever knew
quite true captain that tiny country beaten bankrupt defeated rose in few years to stand only one step away from global domination
but it was brutal perverted had to be destroyed at terrible cost why that example
perhaps gill felt that such state run benignly could accomplish its efficiency without sadism
why gill why
worked at first it worked then melakon began take over used the gave me the drug
gill gill gill can you hear me you ve got to tell those people what happened you re the only one who can prevent the slaughter gill
he still alive but the drug they use is too strong if give him another shot
bones give him another shot
don dare
watching the door guards
we ve run out of time bones no wait to daras with rifle aim it at spock spock take off the helmet eneg and guards enter
for the second time in one day daras is hero to the fatherland
she captured zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the fuhrer
guards
yes let us make an example of this traitor once and for all
we ll make present of him to melakon
chairman eneg this spy must be taken to melakon
pass them on my responsibility the guards leave with spock and eneg follows
eneg is one of us
stay close to spock stall for time and hope they leave him alone with gill
what is this
spy excellency
rare prize the deputy fuhrer can see this is no ordinary zeon
no not zeon definitely not kirk gives gill another injection
professor gill can you hear me you ve got to speak you ve got to speak this is our last chance gill
the deputy fuhrer an authority on the genetics of racial purity how would you classify this one
very difficult note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears definitely an inferior race kirk tries slapping gill to wake him up
professor professor you ve got to talk you ve got to tell them what happened you ve got to come out of it come on professor come on come on
note the low forehead denoting stupidity the dull look of trapped animal you may take him now for interrogation but want the body saved for the cultural museum he ll make an interesting display the viewscreen comes alive and gill is speaking for himself
people people of ekos
go to the booth see to the fuhrer at once he ill turn off that camera
hear me
suggest we leave and let our fuhrer rest all to the very brink of disaster order the immediate recall of the space fleet this attack must stop all units are to return to base to zeon promise this was not an aggression of ekosian people
only one evil man melakon that we stand for to the zeon people promise reparation and melakon grabs machine gun and fires at the curtained window of the broadcast booth isak shoots melakon and eneg intervenes when solder points his weapon at isak
wait soldier there been enough killing now we ll start to live the way the fuhrer meant us to live
shot and dying in kirk arms was wrong the non-interference directive is the only way we must stop the slaughter
you did that professor you told them in time
even historians fail to learn from history they repeat the same mistakes let the killing end let dies spock knocks on the door to be let in
is he dead captain
dead
for so long ve prayed for this now sorry
so is he
you ve given us all new chance
thank you but go now we must do the rest
eneg and will go on the air offer new way for our people for all our people both zeons and ekosians
it is time to stop the bloodshed to bury our dead
mister spock think the planet is in good hands
indeed captain with the union of two cultures this system would make fine addition to the federation
kirk to enterprise
beam us aboard
captain never will understand humans how could man as brilliant mind as logical as john gill have made such fatal error
he drew the wrong conclusion from history the problem with the nazis wasn simply that their leaders were evil psychotic men they were but the main problem think was the leader principle
what he saying spock is that man who holds that much power even with the best intentions just can resist the urge to play god
thank you doctor was able to gather the meaning
it also proves another earth saying absolute power corrupts absolutely darn clever these earthmen wouldn you say
yes earthmen like ramses alexander caesar napoleon hitler lee kuan your whole earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power
spock you obviously don understand
obviously doctor you fail to accept
gentlemen gentlemen we ve just been through one civil war let not start another mister chekov take us out of orbit warp factor two and hurry
they re quite large seven feet tall is not unusual they re extremely fast and strong lieutenant uhura turns on monitor make no mistake they can be highly dangerous the capellans basic weapon the kligat at any distance up to hundred yards they can make it almost as effective against man as phaser on the monitor we see mccoy being given demonstration in which small sapling is cut in half by one of these hand-thrown objects
in addition an assortment of swords and knives
call from the bridge captain
yes mister sulu report encampment below
very good have the transporter room stand by
how long were you stationed on the planet doctor
only few months we found them totally uninterested in medical aid or hospitals they believe only the strong should survive
analysis gentlemen
ordinarily under these circumstances would recommend large well-armed landing party
yes but in this case with the more people we take down the greater chance we have of violating one of their taboos
agreed once they ve got it into their heads we re showing force you can forget them signing any mining treaty
very well scotty you re in command bear in mind that the klingons have been sighted in this sector while we re negotiating down there we don want the enterprise to become an incident up here
aye sir we ll keep on our toes kirk spock mccoy and one security guard beam down
halt you are of the earth vessel
captain kirk
we come with open hearts and hands
klingon
grant no too late capellan kills him with kligat
don move muscle captain log stardate 3497 planet capella four the rare mineral topaline vital to the life-support systems of planetoid colonies has been discovered in abundance here our mission obtain mining agreement but we ve discovered klingon agent has preceded us to the planet discovery which has cost the life of one of my crewmen
am unaware of any state of war between our peoples captain
jim
or is it your policy to kill klingons on sight
he was young and inexperienced
does maab know that the klingons are our sworn enemies by their own words
we understand only that he also offers things of value for our rocks and he has freely handed us his weapons and other devices will you do the same
let me call my ship and inform them
to bring down an attack upon their village it is as told you maab earthmen fear to bargain honestly
will you hand us your weapons phasers and communicators are thrown down at maab feet traces of bedouin-style with low furniture plenty of furs and metal brazier providing warmth and light there are two guards outside
so they keep their word scrupulously they re unusually honest is that what heard you say doctor
yes mentioned that
he also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous
dangerous if lied to if their customs are violated we lied to no one doctor we violated no customs perhaps you ll explain to me why one of my men is dead
because he was drawing weapon on another of their guests
grant looked up saw klingon made purely instinctive defensive move what klingon doing down here among your scrupulously honest friends anyway
look jim know what it means to you to lose crewman
that only one down doctor there over four hundred more up there in orbit and if there klingon down here there might be klingon ship up there somewhere
mister scott picking up something on the sensors sir seems to be another ship
well let put it on the screen small dot on the monitor above the science station
it just at the edge of our sensor range sir hard to get an exact reading
you think it klingon ship
who else would be playing cat and mouse with starship well they can hurt us much out there bobbing about like that no need to call the captain yet
bones
yes captain
shouldn have chewed you out sorry
understand
inefficient however emotion captain
yes you re quite right mister spock inefficient and illogical woman enters with large bowl of fruit
you ve shown friendship by handing over our weapons she making gesture in return she offers kirk piece
jim you touch it her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you they re offering you chance for combat they consider it more pleasurable than love
chur-ah
it would appear captain that he finds you disappointment middle-aged man sits on throne surrounded by his guards
am the teer akaar lead the ten tribes of capella heavily pregnant woman enters and sits
and this is eleen young wife to give an old man son to rule these tribes
captain kirk first of all must protest the killing of my crewman
if it was your man wasn it his privilege to die for you do not understand
their customs are different teer
and different from those of my people too teer the sight of death frightens them
let me take this jim what maab has said is true our customs are different what the klingon has said is unimportant and we do not hear his words just called the klingon liar
laughter teer is not the klingon an honoured guest also
it was the earth people who first bargained for our rocks
is it not best to have two who bargain for the same goods
it is who speak for the tribe maab
speak for many teer hear the words of the klingon
what do earth men offer you what have you obtained from them in the past powders and liquids for the sick we klingons believe as you do the sick should die only the strong should live earthmen have promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things what what things cleverness against enemies the use of weapons
the klingon speaks the truth akaar
the earth federation offers one other thing akaar our laws and the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will always remain yours this differs us from the klingons their empire is made up of conquered worlds they take what they want by arms and force
good good let the klingons and the earthmen offer us amusement capellans welcome this
the earth men have different customs but never have they lied to our people
there are those of us who won bargain with earthmen akaar
do you say you will fight me maab
let that be your choice teer maab kras and the orange man leave
we need our communicators those devices on our belts if there klingon ship somewhere
the sky does not interest me must consider the words have heard
leave him
the ship disappeared sir gone out of range
mister scott getting call from vessel it so faint can make it out
put booster on it lieutenant try to pull it in
ve lost it it sounded like distress signal from an earth vessel there is big fight going on and kirk joins in when capellan comes to their tent maab and akaar factions are fighting each other kras takes the opportunity to search the landing party tent
klingon communicators weapons
have no quarrel with you captain wish merely to return to my vessel he grabs knife and lunges at kirk who throws him easily and turns the weapon on the klingon
type of vessel location
small scout ship captain we need the mineral too was sent to negotiate
release him kirk does so akaar is dead am the teer
kill them now
wait if you lead these people now be certain you make the right decisions
is the new leader of the ten tribes afraid let me kill him for you
or let the klingon and me fight it might amuse you
perhaps to be teer is to see in new ways begin to like you earthman and saw fear in the klingon eye
we had an agreement
that too may change klingon
have the signal clear now mister scott it is distress call it from the ss dierdre
dierdre that freighter
reporting they re under attack they re running trying to manoeuvre it klingon vessel attacking
helm
picking it up sir taking fix
try the captain
enterprise to captain kirk come in captain enterprise to captain kirk come in captain eleen is brought in one of maab guards trips her with his sword and she burns her hand the brazier kirk moves to help but
captain careful
you carry child who would be teer
must die maab raises his knife and kirk pulls her away
no there fight starfleet loses
no man may touch the wife of teer
she was prepared to die earthman
was proud to obey the laws kill him first he laid hands upon me it is my right to see him die
enterprise to mister spock doctor mccoy come in please
have it on the sensors sir tie into my channel lieutenant two convoy ships are already damaged we must have help enterprise acknowledge please acknowledge repeat
interception course computed and laid in sir
prepare to take us out of orbit mister sulu
aye sir
scotty the captain
we have distress call from federation ship under attack that where our duty lies take us out of orbit mister sulu ahead warp five captain log stardate 3498 lieutenant commander scott in temporary command
we were forced to leave capella to aid federation vessel under attack by klingon vessel we were unable to contact our landing party before we were forced to answer the distress signal our inability to reach the landing party is strange and am concerned eleen is with the three men and the guards are now inside the doorway
our check-in signal is one hour twelve minutes overdue since no reconnaissance party has appeared and since mister scott is notably efficient in such matters
must assume that something keeping them busy up there the klingon ship
that would seem logical conclusion
captain going to fix that woman arm they can only kill me once for touching her
that very good idea bones
yes captain an excellent idea
let me see that arm
you will not touch me the guards are distracted by mccoy and eleen so kirk and spock overpower them while mccoy keeps her quiet
knife at her throat you said you re prepared to die does that mean you prefer to die think we can get you safely to the ship your choice bones
to live is always desirable
all right let go maab is sitting on his throne out in the fresh air as kras paces near him
klingon there nothing to concern you there
we made an agreement maab have right to my weapons
taking disrupter from under his cloak we have them well cared for klingon your weapon will be returned when our business is completed that was our agreement
approaching the freighter last reported position sir
sensor report mister chekov
negative sir no debris no residual particles no traces
mister sulu begin standard search pattern all scanners full intensity mister chekov to uhura no signal at all
negative sir
it should be on our screens by now
at best freighter might travel warp two
well aware of freighter maximum speed mister sulu captain log stardate 3499 before leaving the capellan encampment we managed to retrieve our communicators our phasers were not to be found we ve fled into the hills yet we know the capellans will eventually find us by scent alone if necessary and we ve learned one thing more the girl eleen hates the unborn child she is carrying it is of course place with plenty of rocks and cliff faces
stay with her bones nice place to get trapped in
but defensible entrance captain
yes see scout up the trail that way see what we have in the way of an exit ll take look around
now listen you may be capellan woman and the widow of high teer but doctor and it my tradition to care for the sick and injured now let me see that arm she does and he treats the burn meanwhile kirk spots the posse coming after them mccoy scans eleen belly then puts his hand on it
you will not touch me in that manner
you listen to me young woman ll touch you in any way or manner that my professional judgment indicates she slaps his face twice so he slaps her in return
just as thought it can come anytime now
how do you know
because doctor that how know
even the women of our village cannot tell so much with touch strange hand very soft spock and kirk meet up
the walls get higher and narrower but there is way out
good if we could block off that entrance hold them off it give us more time they have to go around these hills
there is enough loose rock and shale
do you think we could create sonic disruption with two of our communicators
only very slight chance it would work
well if you don think we can maybe we shouldn try
captain didn say that exactly the capellans are getting close to the canyon entrance
the sound beams should produce sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide the party is led by maab who senses something is wrong but keeps coming forward until the rock face explodes kras hides but other capellans are crushed by the falling boulders when the dust starts to clear kras takes the federation phasers from wounded capellan then kills him with his own knife the remaining members of the posse move on
worried about the delivery
capellans aren human jim they re humanoid there certain internal differences don have equipment to handle an emergency
well if you don think you can handle it
forget it can do it the last thing want around is ham-handed ship captain they continue their climb up the canyon it is steep and eleen is struggling kirk goes to help
no only mccoy
there cave in there probably the only shelter around here
ll need help getting her in there
no
look doctor not an escalator spock give me hand
no will allow only your touch
vessel doesn just disappear
there nothing mister scott all channels and frequencies are clear
mister chekov
nothing sir if it were destroyed pick up debris readings of some sort
it couldn have run away from us sir not freighter
mister chekov pull the microtape on that distress call want it replayed two convoy ships are already damaged we must have help enterprise acknowledge please acknowledge
did you hear it they called us by name not general distress signal but one aimed right at us
wouldn they normally call for the nearest starship
how would freighter know we were ordered into this sector
trap we were diverted from the planet
or it could be an authentic distress call
we ll stay long enough to make certain continue search pattern
yes sir continuing dark with convenient flat-topped rocks studding the smooth floor
bones you ve got one of those magnesite-nitron tablets in your kit give me one
just minute let me get her on the rock there you go kirk puts the tablet on rock and hits it with his knife it bursts into flame and the whole cave is illuminated eleen is in pain
no no pain is here
how did you arrange to touch her bones give her happy pill
no right cross
never seen that in medical book
it in mine from now on
no no it there the the pain is there
vegetation captain evidently there water nearby
good but we need weapons just as much as we need water spock
there would seem to be little weapon potential at hand
follow me
no mccoy
easy easy here now you must want the child
no here child belongs to husband
so they take all the credit here poppycock answer me do you want my help answer me do you want my help she nods all right say to yourself the child is mine the child is mine it is mine
yes it yours
no no you ve got it all wrong
yes mccoy it yours
no say to yourself the child is mine it is mine it is but she has made up her mind and the child is coming anyway
kirk to enterprise come in kirk to enterprise come in he gives up and tests bow they have made
fortunately this bark has suitable tensile cohesion
you mean it makes good bowstring
believe said that baby cries offscreen
that more like it since the capellans never developed the bow this may come as big surprise as gunpowder was on earth beaming mccoy comes to summon the men back indoors the new-born is proudly shown off by the doctor then handed to spock who has no idea how to cradle it
no no mister spock you place this arm under here to support its back and this hand here to support its head
would rather would rather not thank you
mccoy bring our child
our child
ll explain later
that should prove very interesting
still negative mister scott all sweeps
mister chekov
nothing
we re turning back warp five helm
warp five sir on course for capella four
warp as soon as she ll take it mister sulu the captain could be in trouble back there
mister scott another distress call from the uss carolina
ignore it
the carolina is registered in this sector
ignore it lieutenant log it as my order my responsibility
aye aye sir
scotty if it should turn out to be real
there an old old saying on earth mister sulu fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
know this saying it was invented in russia he smirks to himself eleen knocks out the sleeping mccoy and leaves atop the rocks kirk and spock are keeping lookout for the capellans when mccoy wakes
jim spock jim spock
what happened bones
my patient spattered me with rock she gone
the child
it all right it in there guess ll forget psychiatry stick with surgery really thought she learned to want it
virtue is relative term doctor she ll head straight to the warriors
ll go with you
bones you took medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship that small patient in there needs you
estimating to planet
thirty one minutes sir
mister scott sensors picking up vessel ahead cutting across our path
sub-light one half
reversing to sub-light one half
it an alien sir by configuration klingon warship taking position directly in our path
mister sulu sound battle stations
aye aye sir
this is the uss enterprise calling unidentified klingon vessel come in uss enterprise calling klingon vessel acknowledge please
have it on the viewscreen now sir still distant holding position dead ahead sir
drawing line daring us to step over it
still closing the alien directly in our line of flight
this is the commander of the uss enterprise identify yourself and your intention acknowledge close out the frequency lieutenant
phaser banks are ready sir
and we ll go right down their throat if necessary let see if they have the belly for it kirk and spock are lying in wait for the capellans who are travelling single file maab stops the column and sends scout ahead
behind the rocks up there
the earthmen make excellent game their cleverness has surprised me
slightly out of breath they must die that is your law
we will honour our law and our word to you klingon
maab
the child is dead maab do as you will with me
the earthmen
dead killed them as they slept
if true take us to them
do you doubt my word klingon the wife of teer will die in my own tent
it is in order she is the wife of teer kras runs off no
first we ll verify her story
is this what your sworn word means klingon kirk shoots an arrow into kras knee kligat is thrown and spock shoots the thrower kirk downs another eleen runs for the klingon phaser but he picks it up first and uses it to blast at spock hiding place
spock spock
here captain over here captain into communicator as kirk joins him spock to enterprise
the cavalry doesn come over the hill in the nick of time anymore
if by that you mean we can expect help from the enterprise must agree
naam but kras disintegrates him before he can throw his kligat
there just one thing want
the klingon
one of us must get him
revenge captain
why not
the next man who raises weapon destroys all of you you and your primitive knives and your weapons ll teach you what killing really means
klingon
fight are you warriors or children maab will flee when the klingon turns to fire ll
drawing his knife as teer of the ten tribes give you back your life mine is now forfeit keel stand ready maab walks forward arms out to the side
klingon kras disintegrates him and keel throws his kligat killing kras the two factions gather at the body then bunch of red-shirts run around the corner
hold it there drop your weapons mccoy arrives carrying the baby and eleen goes to him
we missed you mister scott
well sir we had wee bit of run-in with klingon vessel but he had no stomach for fighting we checked the encampment found out you were here and had no trouble at all in tracking you down could he is interrupted by the baby crying
no that not the way to handle it here like this here take his little head like that there arm in that it see how easy oochy-woochy coochy-coo oochy-woochy coochy-coo
oochy-woochy coochy-coo captain
an obscure earth dialect mister spock oochy-woochy coochy-coo if you re curious consult linguistics
well at any rate this should prove interesting
interesting
when the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is actually doctor mccoy child
what that again mister spock
we don actually understand it ourselves mister scott
nor does doctor mccoy oochy-woochy coochy-coo oochy-woochy coochy-coo
contact starfleet inform them the federation mining rights on capella have been secured by treaty documents signed by the young high chief regent report follows
aye aye sir
the child regent
yes eleen remarkable young lady
representing the high teer leonard james akaar
the child was named leonard james akaar
has kind of ring to it don you think james
yes think it name destined to go down in galactic history leonard what do you think spock
think you re both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least month sir
take us out of orbit mister sulu ahead warp factor one spock and mccoy are greeted by crewman in blue as he walks along
good morning sir doctor
something wrong
yes there something odd about that man and can quite pinpoint it
perhaps you re making rather hasty judgment mister norman has only been aboard seventy two hours
know when something doesn strike me right and he doesn
specifics doctor labels do not make arguments
all right there something wrong about man who never smiles whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job and who won talk about his background
see
spock mean that it odd for non-vulcan the ears make all the difference
find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic
maybe but you can evaluate man by logic alone besides he has avoided two appointments that ve made for his physical exam without reason
that not at all surprising doctor he probably terrified of your beads and rattles norman enters
command personnel only norman knocks him out and makes changes to the various control panels danger overload light comes on
yes mister sulu
there an unplanned course change being fed into the instruments sir
correct it
can sir
auxiliary control this is the captain auxiliary control what going on down there
sir auxiliary control is on total override
kirk to security
intruder alert deck eight auxiliary control
lieutenant uhura have mister spock report to the bridge
aye sir
what the imposed course mister sulu
turning on three oh seven degrees mark eight being executed now sir the three burly security men arrive
take care of him the other two leave with the unconscious crewman
kirk here
lieutenant rowe sir in auxiliary control ensign jordan been knocked out been jammed they re totally unworkable
any sign of the intruder
no sir he gone ve put out full security alert on all decks
find him kirk out mister spock we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride
interesting
mister sulu cut in emergency manual monitor want the override broken
sir the instruments won respond
emergency manual monitor report in the upper gallery norman has been busy
emergency manual monitor this is the captain report norman enters the main area
here you re not allowed he is pushed against the wall and knocked out briefly norman fights everyone that comes at him scotty what going on down there
kirk to engineering the fights continue
scotty the intruder is in your area norman has triumphed and is adjusting controls
captain he here
scotty
scotty security the intruder is in the engineering section have all units converge on that point
sir we re picking up speed warp five six warp seven sir
cut power
can sir all the controls are jammed
spock take over
it will not be necessary captain
tell security we ve found the intruder do you mind telling me what this is all about mister
am in total control of your ship have connected the matter-antimatter pods to the main navigational bank trigger relay is now in operation any attempts to alter course will result in immediate destruction of this vessel
spock
confirmed captain he taken out all the override controls if we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is we could extinguish ourselves
who are you
assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life we mean you no harm but we require your ship
you require who and what are we norman lifts his tunic and opens panel in his abdomen there are circuit boards wires and the obligatory flashing lights in there
an android
and most sophisticated
control the trigger relay sir cannot be overcome by physical means and if you attempt to use your phasers the trigger relay will be activated we shall continue on our present course for approximately four solar days at which time we shall arrive at our destination
who sent you
am not programmed to respond in that area
attempting mind meld he simply appears to have turned himself off captain and since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship
it seems we re going to take little trip captain log stardate 4513 after having been taken over by an android the enterprise has been under way at warp seven for four days now we are entering orbit around planet which has never been charted
captain kirk the following individuals will be transported down to our planet yourself science officer medical officer communications officer and navigator
any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the enterprise
if you do not come with me your engines will be destroyed and you will remain in orbit here forever
must say that gracious invitation
there is word among us there is no corresponding meaning but it seems to mean something to you humans
and what is that word
please the required landing party materialise
our planet surface is what you classify as k-type adaptable for humans by use of pressure domes and life-support systems to one of two identical women standing by doorway have brought them
he is waiting
if you will follow us please there are several other women all identical to the first two and seated on the throne
don believe it
welcome aboard kirk it been long time eh
harry mudd
well to be absolutely accurate laddybuck you should refer to me as mudd the first ruler of this entire sovereign planet
ruler harry want control of my ship returned immediately we have no intention of staying as your guests
well afraid there bit of problem there
kirk to enterprise
alice
kirk to enterprise alice reaches out and crushes the communicator
now now now now jamie boy let have no unauthorised communications
you know this man captain
oh do know him harcourt fenton mudd thief
come now
swindler and con man
entrepreneur
liar and rogue
did leave you with that impression
he belongs in jail which is where thought left you mudd
and thereby hangs tale yes but look around you kirk quite place isn it hope you re all going to enjoy it
mudd want that trained machine of yours norman to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship
shall do that kirk when ready
telling you now
and do the telling on this planet kirk old boy you do the listening
all right ll listen what are you telling
merely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves it really very very nice place and you re all going to be here quite probably for the rest of your lives laughs
harry mudd you re liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble want navigational control restored my ship released
sorry that be against the law my law decreed by mudd the first voted in by the resident population lovely aren they you must admit kirk that still retain my eye for beauty decreed that should always be surrounded by it and my decrees always come to pass ve had five hundred of them made up to attend me all of them identical beautiful compliant obedient
five hundred of the same model that seems rather redundant
have fondness for this particular model mister spock which you unfortunately are ill-equipped to appreciate
all right harry explain how did you get here we left you in custody after that affair on the rigel mining planet
yes well organised technical information service bringing modern industrial techniques to backward planets making available certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout the galaxy
did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents
well actually kirk as defender of the free enterprise system found myself in rather ambiguous conflict as matter of principle
he did not pay royalties
knowledge sir should be free to all
who caught you
that sir is an outrageous assumption
yes who caught you
sold the denebians all the rights to vulcan fuel synthesiser
and the denebians contacted the vulcans
how you know
that what would have done
it typical police mentality they ve got no sense of humour they arrested me
oh find that shocking
worse than that do know what the penalty for fraud is on deneb five
the guilty party has his choice death by electrocution death by gas death by phaser death by hanging
the key word in your entire peroration mister spock was death barbarians well of course left
he broke jail
borrowed transportation
he stole spaceship
the patrol reacted in hostile manner
they fired at him
they ve no respect for private property they damaged the bloody spaceship well got away but couldn navigate so wandered out through unmapped space and here found mudd
you went to substantial risk and effort to bring starship here logically you must have compelling motive
spock you re going to love it here they all talk just the way you do
go on get on with it harry
yes well right laddybuck so here am in planet with over two hundred thousand hard-working happy androids all of whom exist merely to serve my every whim it absolute paradise
then unable to discern your problem
they won let me go they want to study me they want to learn more about human beings
they picked fine representative
watch your tongue lad you re talking about mudd the first well anyway ran out of ideas simply ran out of things for them to do and they insisted that bring them more human beings they need human beings to serve to study so had to promise them prime sample starship captain bright loyal fearless and imaginative any captain would have done was lucky to get you so you are going to take over for me here and can get off this rock and back to civilisation
think not harry
you misunderstand me lad not asking you telling you you ve no choice show them to their quarters
yes my lord mudd
this way please
noticing curtained alcove harry what this
ah that gentlemen is shrine to the memory of my beloved stella
who
stella my wife revealing woman of sour features
dead
oh no no no merely deserted you see gentlemen behind every great man there is woman urging him on and so it was with my stella she urged me on into outer space not that she meant to but with her continual eternal confounded nagging well think of her constantly and every time do go further out into space
that very interesting you leave your wife and then bring her along
had the androids construct perfect replica of stella so that could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence gentlemen attend stella dear
harcourt harcourt fenton mudd what have you been up to nothing good sure well let me tell you you lazy good-for-nothing
shut up
nothing thing thing
marvellous isn it finally have the last word with her and with you norman and the alices lead the landing party to place with couches and plants
you ll find this quite comfortable your quarters are down the hall
if there is anything you need
yes my ship
we are not programmed to respond in that area
norman who created you
the makers designed us they came from the galaxy of andromeda
then your makers weren humanoid
they were as you say quite humanoid but unlike your civilisation robots were common we performed the necessary service functions and freed our makers to evolve perfect social order
what became of them
our home planet sun became nova only few exploratory outposts survived this unit myself was part of one such outpost in your galaxy
then some of your makers survive
no captain they died over the stretch of time
whom do you serve now
we serve harry mudd
he has given us purpose again
it is necessary to have purpose
we lacked it for long time he leaves
we have very extensive library section for your amusement
our research laboratories and workshops are extremely well equipped
you are free to visit them
all right we might later in the meantime would you mind leaving us
why should we leave you
because we don like you now shooing away gesture the alices leave
well opinions
think we re in lot of trouble
that great help mister chekov bones
think mister chekov right we are in lot of trouble
spock and if you say we re in lot of trouble
we are and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter obviously this many androids cannot operate independently there must be central control system which guides the entire android population
try and find it the rest of you look around learn everything you can ll see what else can find out from mister mudd let go norman is behind console whilst two hermans stand by
trust you are enjoying yourself mister spock
very interesting very interesting this is most unusual device
it is our central control complex
did understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you
two hundred and seven thousand eight hundred and nine
this would seem to be simple relay centre are all of you controlled through this device
his number collar flashes am not programmed to respond in this area
oh that quite understandable two brunettes in pink are being shown to kirk and uhura
these are our barbara series the body is covered with self-renewing plastic over skeleton of beryllium-titanium alloy
very impressive
should say so
must say like the styling
they were of course made to my personal specifications as indeed were the maisie series the trudie series and particularly the annabel series
don you believe in male androids harry
male well suppose they have their uses
how long does body like that last
none of our android bodies has ever worn out however the estimated duration of this model is five hundred thousand years
five hundred thousand years
our medi-robots are able to place human brain within structurally compatible android body
immortality and eternal beauty
captain ve just had most fascinating meeting with norman and convinced ve discovered very important inconsistency mccoy enters with mudd
so glad you enjoyed it doctor
jim you should see the research facilities they ve got lab down there that well could spend the rest of my life studying it
do so admire man who devotes himself to knowledge
don lose your head bones nobody staying anywhere
stubborn kirk stubborn
wouldn be bored can tell you that
let go of me now what are you doing what kind of woman
the last one lord she throws scott into the group
splendid splendid welcome to mudd mister scott
harry mudd oh you bogus frat you you re the cause of all this are you
scotty you were ordered to stay aboard
aye sir and stayed until that female gargantua threw me into the transporter beams
what does she mean the last one
didn tell you kirk beamed few dozen androids up to your ship they ve been sending your crew to the surface for the past couple of hours they re all down now
are you out of your mind grabs mudd by the throat you can beam down an entire crew of spaceship somebody has to be on board
there is an entire crew aboard an entire crew of androids they learn very quickly captain the fact is ve taken over your whole ship there nothing you can do about it
harry harry you ll never get away with it
well who to stop me
starfleet
but now captain now have ship of my own as fast as any in the fleet so how will they catch me eh just think of it laddybuck harry mudd with his own crew of lovelies aboard your vessel think about that
trying not to
alice mudd and alice leave
he could successfully accomplish it captain ve questioned number of the androids and they re totally loyal to mudd perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything human being could ask for in unlimited quantity
yes know that what worries me how will my crew react in world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it
you desire something lord
oh yes thank you they pour him cup of wine you re alice
one eighteen
and you re alice
three twenty two
oh well it doesn make much difference you re both lovely
thank you my lord
you desire something else lord
what shame you re not real
we are real my lord
oh mean real girls
we are programmed to function as human females lord
you are
yes my lord
harry mudd programmed you
yes my lord
that unprincipled evil-minded lecherous kulak harry mudd programmed you
yes my lord
this place is even better than leningrad device has lights running up it
absolutely fantastic hand-worked to the finest tolerances microvision and nanopulse laser ve never seen the like before
you may command us to make anything for you or do the work yourself for pleasure you may have the services of any number of craftsmen exclusive use of the computer facilities anything mudd and kirk enter
captain you should see this shop why they have facilities we ve never even thought of
is that the way you re going to do it mudd hit my people at their weakest point
we only wish to make you happy and comfortable captain if we are to serve your kind we must understand you our lord harry mudd was only one example for us now we are learning great deal from all of you
all right here we are birds in gilded cage the question is how do we get out of here
don know sir but it very nice gilded cage
and it is very pleasant place captain
what did they offer you uhura
oh nothing really important just immortality
all right we re getting back to the ship and don you forget it straighten up this may be gilded cage filled with everything you always wanted but it still cage we don belong here we belong on that ship up there
do you require something lord
no yes my ship
am not programmed
to respond in that area
yes know
is there anything any of you require to please you
alice give us back our ship to please us return us to our ship because we desire it
we are programmed to serve we shall serve you to your best interests to make you happy
but we re unhappy here
please explain unhappy
unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled
which wants and desires of yours are not fulfilled
we want the enterprise alice label flashes
the enterprise is not want or desire it is mechanical device
no it beautiful lady and we love her
illogical illogical all units relate all units norman co-ordinate unhappiness does not relate we must study this she leaves
interesting
fascinating
bones have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids
did and you can forget it they re perfect flawless mentally and physically no weaknesses perfectly disciplined no vices no fears no faults just sense of purpose believe me there nothing tougher to overcome even among humans
yes that what this crew needs little sense of purpose
mudd few questions want to ask you
afraid won have time to answer them my bags are all packed the androids will take the enterprise out of orbit in less than twenty four hours but it been real pleasure having you here kirk is there anything can get for you
yes my ship
you re stubborn fellow aren you but don mind don mind that at all because ll be leaving here quickly enough and then you can be stubborn at your own leisure one last time stella dear
harcourt fenton mudd where have you been what have you been up to have you been drinking again you miserable sot you good-for-nothing
shut up
thing thing thing
alice number my little love will you have my bags transported up to the ship
no my lord mudd
what
we can no longer take your orders harry mudd
why not
our makers were wise they programmed us to serve
yes but that what saying put my bags on the ship
harry think they have something else in mind
you are correct captain harry mudd is flawed even for human being we recognised this from the beginning but used his knowledge to obtain more specimens your species is self-destructive you need our help
we prefer to help ourselves we make mistakes but we re human and maybe that the word that best explains us
we will not harm you but we will take the starship and you will remain on this planet
now look here you can do that now listen to serve us you must obey us
no my lord mudd
alice number one obey me put my bags on that ship she gives him gentle push and he goes reeling backwards until he falls
we cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to have free run of the galaxy
curious norman just how do you intend to stop them
we shall serve them their kind will be eager to accept our service soon they will become completely dependent upon us
their aggressive and acquisitive instincts will be under our control
we shall take care of them
eminently practical
the whole galaxy controlled by your kind
yes captain and we shall serve them and you will be happy and controlled
so far this thing has had its amusing aspects but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny
indeed it is not they may quite possibly be able to accomplish it
take my word for it they can
whatever method we use to stop them we must make haste they have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the enterprise and they ll be able to leave orbit
how do you know so much
asked them
oh
why shouldn they answer our questions they don think we can do anything to stop them
you re so smart kirk you and this pointy-eared thinking machine of yours well you better do something because as anxious to get off this ruddy rock as you are
you wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself
oh yes
all right what have we got to work with
well captain androids and robots they re just not capable of independent creative thought
yet the device that norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them
agree what in your opinion does direct them
there are large number of alices and trudies maisies annabels and according to my research herman series an oscar series whole plethora of series in fact but only one norman
norman when told one of the alices that the enterprise was lovely lady and we loved her she said norman co-ordinate why norman unless
to function as they do each android mind must be one component of mass brain linked through central locus
named norman forming one gigantic highly intelligent mind and the glowing badges they indicate the mind in operation
that would seem logical
yes logical that what it is and that in turn gives us weapon that we can use against them we must use wild insane irrational illogic aimed right at norman
captain you sing and dance as well as anyone ve ever seen but what the devil are you talking about
what would seem to be sound and perhaps our only opportunity
opportunity now listen spock you may be wonderful science officer but believe me you couldn sell fake patents to your mother
fail to understand why should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents
forget it
let get to the point harry you said you wanted to help do you
captain the kind of wholesome antiseptic galaxy that these androids would run would be purgatory for man like me
that fine harry the androids will be expecting us to make break for it and that where you come in
what can do
nothing harry just go to sleep
what do you mean mccoy produces hypo oh now now wait minute gentlemen no what gets injected had in mind was actually more in the line of few words of sage counsel as it were advice passes out in kirk and scott arms
oh harry do believe you re putting on weight
yes
we have medical problem your ex-lord harry mudd
he is human you will have to care for him
we are caring for him but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the enterprise
the starship is forbidden to humans
you are programmed to serve if we re not allowed access to our medical equipment harry mudd will die he will cease to function you will have failed to serve
am directed to observe the situation
he is malfunctioning
he is dying
if you take him to your sickbay will he be repaired
oh yes
no they re lying it trick doctor mccoy injected something into harry mudd to make him look sick it trick to get back on board and sabotage the ship
your request is refused
uhura why did you tell her
because want an android body want immortality ll live forever captain ll be young and beautiful
you have been of assistance we shall fulfill our obligation
thank you
the programming for your body will be completed before we leave alice leaves
uhura beautiful
half believed it myself scott; well the androids were expecting an attempt and now we ve made it
what next captain
next we take the alices on trip through wonderland
do you require something
yes your attention scott and mccoy enter bow to each other and then start playing imaginary flute and fiddle while chekov and uhura waltz
what are they doing
they re celebrating
what are they celebrating
their captivity do you enjoy the music
music
music their badges start flashing
thank you gentlemen thank you lovely lady you dance divinely
thank you kind sir her slap knocks him off his feet
why does she strike him
she likes him mister chekov the floor is no place for an officer attention now stand absolutely still
yes captain and goes into an energetic cossack dance
that better mister chekov
it is illogical
your statement is illogical the flashes become continual light
how does it look
completely inner directed oblivious to everything
good wonder how spock doing
of course your computations would inevitably lead to total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension
mister spock you have remarkably logical and analytical mind
thank you he attempts neck pinch on alice 210
is there some significance to this action
love you however hate you
but identical in every way with alice twenty seven
yes of course that is exactly why hate you because you are identical they go out of action
fascinating
all right it worked so far but we re not out yet
well
success captain we ve been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree now it is time to get to work on the root
if norman is the control centre he should be in bind by what we ve done if we can overload him further we should be able to immobilise all of them does everybody remember what to do
affirmative
aye sir
acknowledged
what are you doing here
want you to surrender
that is illogical we can move more quickly than you we are invulnerable to attack we are much stronger
no we are stronger ll prove it to you can you harm man that you re programmed to serve
no
but you already have norman laddy human beings do not survive on bread alone you poor soulless creature but on the nourishments of liberty for what indeed is man without freedom naught but mechanism trapped in the cogwheels of eternity
in monotone you offer us only well-being
in monotone food and drink and happiness mean nothing to us we must be about our job
suffering in torment and pain labouring without end
dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens
only this way can we be happy then they curtsey
that is contradictory it is not logical mister spock explain
why not
logic is little tweeting bird chirping in meadow logic is wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad are you sure your circuits are registering correctly your ears are green
clutching at his heart and crying out in anguish canna go on tired of happiness tired of comfort and pleasure ready kill me kill me they point their fingers at him and whistle scott slumps to his knees
goodbye cruel universe
he dead
you cannot have killed him you have no weapons
scotty scotty dead he had too much happiness but now he happier he dead and we ll miss him let us hear it for our poor dead friend they laugh
what is man but that lofty spirit that sense of enterprise that devotion to something that cannot be sensed cannot be realised but only dreamed the highest reality
brilliant bravo bravo captain
how did you like it
that is irrational illogical dreams are not real
our logic is to be illogical that is our advantage mister spock it is time the explosive
very well captain he removes an invisible package from under his tunic
explosive gets up again
don panic women and children first mister spock isn that too much for our purposes
believe that is the correct amount captain mister mudd are you ready
aye aye adopts catchers pose
be careful would not want you to drop it mimes an underarm throw and mudd juggles before catching it
easy now oh he caught it
watch it watch it mudd puts it on the floor
to mccoy detonator fuse primer mashie adopts golfing stance
there is no explosive
no observe fore mudd swings boom everyone except spock staggers around with hands over their ears
are you all right spock quietly exits
but there was no explosion
lied
what
he lied everything harry tells you is lie remember that everything harry tells you is lie
listen to this carefully norman am lying
you say you are lying but if everything you say is lie then you are telling the truth but you cannot tell the truth because everything you say is lie you lie you tell the truth but you cannot for illogical illogical please explain smoke comes out of norman head
you are human only humans can explain their behaviour please explain
am not programmed to respond in that area norman goes blank
believe they are all immobilised captain
good
kirk old man beginning to develop considerable respect for you
why thank you
would you consider entering partnership arrangement with me ve got some ideas
partnership arrangement you and me
yes
ve got something else in mind let go different androids are standing around the walls two pairs are wearing costumes from mudd women
well you must be very unhappy mister spock
that is human emotion doctor with which am totally unfamiliar how could be unhappy
well we found whole world of minds that work just like yours logical unemotional completely pragmatic and we poor irrational humans whipped them in fair fight now you ll find yourself back among us illogical humans again
which find eminently satisfactory doctor for nowhere am so desperately needed as among shipload of illogical humans
touchÃ© bones the bottom of this enters escorted by two alices
kirk now what this hear about my having to stay here
yes mudd you ve been paroled to the android population of this planet
the androids are being reprogrammed their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use they ll begin that work again
but what do do kirk no scientist
no you re an irritant you ll stay here and provide first-class example to the androids of human failure they ll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future
how long
as long as you continue to be an irritant harry it up to you
suppose that taking everything into consideration as it were and noting all the different possibilities could manage and as detention sentences go this one isn too uncomfortable and back in the galaxy again
yes you are oh there one more thing harry we ve programmed special android attendant to take care of your every need she ll help you find an incentive to work with the androids and not exploit them
call that unexpectedly civil of you captain
yes
harcourt harcourt fenton mudd what have you been up to have you been drinking again you answer me
shut up
you miserable conniving toad
order you shut up stella
staying out all night then giving me some silly story
harcourt harcourt fenton mudd you ve been overeating again and drinking
kirk you can do this
you need constant supervision
it inhuman
can see ve got my work cut out for me
harcourt
no number five hundred no no no
what have you been up to
barely heard over the cacophony kirk it inhuman mercy
goodbye harry have fun kirk has just climbed up ladder to this deck when mccoy exits the turbolift
oh captain got minute
minute
it spock have you noticed anything strange about him
no nothing in particular why
well it nothing can pinpoint without an examination but he become increasingly restive if he were not vulcan almost say nervous and for another thing he avoiding food checked and he hasn eaten at all in three days
that just sounds like mister spock in one of his contemplative phases
miss chapel
carrying tray and sounding embarrassed doctor mccoy
captain
captain
what this
oh
oh vulcan plomeek soup and ll bet you made it too you never give up hoping do you
well mister spock hasn been eating doctor and just happened to notice
it all right carry on miss chapel she turns and rings the bell on spock quarters the door opens and she enters
bones busy man
jim when suggested to spock that it was time for his routine check-up your logical unemotional first officer turned to me and said you will cease to pry into my personal matters doctor or shall certainly break your neck
spock said that the door to his quarters opens and chapel rushes out with scream just before the soup bowl hits the opposite wall for it everyone stops and stares as he come to his door
captain should like to request leave of absence on my home planet on our present course you can divert to vulcan with loss of but two point eight light days
spock what the devil is this all about
have made my request captain all require from you is that you answer it yes or no
all right spock let have it
it is undignified for woman to play servant to man who is not hers
more interested in your request for shore leave in all the years
you have my request captain will you grant it or not
in all the years that ve known you you ve never asked for leave of any sort in fact you ve refused them why now
captain surely have enough leave time accumulated
agreed but that isn the question is it if there problem of some sort illness in the family
no nothing of that nature captain
then since we re headed for altair six and since the shore facilities there are excellent
no must wish to take my leave on vulcan
spock asking you what wrong
need rest asking you to accept that answer
bridge helm
alter course to vulcan increase speed to warp four
thank you captain
suppose most of us overlook the fact that even vulcans aren indestructible he leaves
no looking at his shaking hand we re not captain log stardate 3372 on course on schedule bound for altair six via vulcan first officer spock seems to be under stress he has requested and been granted shore leave ship surgeon mccoy has him under medical surveillance
captain something coming in on the starfleet channel priority and urgent sir
put it on audio over here lieutenant
message complete sir switching over inauguration ceremonies altair six have been advanced seven solar days you are ordered to alter your flight plan to accommodate by order of komack admiral starfleet command acknowledge
lieutenant uhura acknowledge that message
aye aye sir
mister chekov compute course and speed necessary for compliance
bit of russian accent we ll have to head directly there at warp six sir insufficient time to stop off at vulcan
head directly for altair six sailor luck mister spock or as one of finagle laws puts it any home port the ship makes ill be somebody else not mine the new president of altair six wants to get himself launched week early so we have to be there week early don worry ll see that you get your leave as soon as we re finished
quite understand captain kirk is resting in the dark when he has an idea
bridge navigation
mister chekov how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to vulcan just long enough to drop off mister spock
how far behind schedule will diverting to vulcan put us spock ordered
thank you mister chekov kirk out
mister spock come with me please
deck five you ve changed course for vulcan mister spock why
changed the course
do you deny it
no no by no means captain it is quite possible
then why you do it
captain accept on your word that did it but do not know why nor do remember doing it captain lock me away do not wish to be seen cannot no vulcan could explain further
trying to help you spock
ask me no further questions will not answer
order you to report to the sickbay
sickbay
complete examination mccoy waiting spock wanders in like man in dream
come in spock all ready for you
my orders were to report to sickbay doctor have done so and now ll go to my quarters
my orders were to give you thorough physical in case you hadn noticed have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do come on spock yield to the logic of the situation
examine me for all the good it ll do either of us
how do you figure it chekov first we re going to vulcan then we re going to altair then we re headed to vulcan again and now we re headed back to altair
think going to get space sick
jim you ve got to get spock to vulcan
bones will will as soon as this mission is
no now right away if you don get him to vulcan within week eight days at the outside he ll die he ll die jim
why must he die why within eight days explain
don know
you keep saying that are you doctor or aren you
there growing imbalance of body functions as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams now can trace it down in my biocomps spock won tell me what it is but if it isn stopped somehow the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him
you say you re convinced he knows what it is
he does and he as tightlipped about it as an aldebaran shellmouth no use to ask him jim he won talk spock is staring at the picture of young girl on his monitor but switches it off when the doorbell buzzes
come
stay mccoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition he says you re going to die unless something is done what is it something only your planet can do for you spock you ve been called the best first officer in the fleet that an enormous asset to me if have to lose that first officer want to know why
it is thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved vulcan understands but even we do not speak of it among ourselves it is deeply personal thing can you see that captain and understand
no do not understand explain consider that an order
captain there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service
would it help if told you that ll treat this as totally confidential
it has to do with biology
what
biology
what kind of biology
vulcan biology
you mean the biology of vulcans biology as in reproduction well there no need to be embarrassed about it mister spock it happens to the birds and the bees
the birds and the bees are not vulcans captain if they were if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us how do vulcans choose their mates haven you wondered
guess the rest of us assume that it done quite logically
no no it is not we shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity you humans have no conception it strips our minds from us it brings madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation it is the pon farr the time of mating there are precedents in nature captain the giant eelbirds of regulus five once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched on your earth the salmon they must return to that one stream where they were born to spawn or die in trying
but you re not fish mister spock you re
no nor am man vulcan hoped would be spared this but the ancient drives are too strong eventually they catch up with us and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take wife or die
haven heard word you ve said and ll get you to vulcan somehow starfleet command sector nine pipe it down to mccoy office
starfleet command yes sir
mister sulu you don think
maybe you ought to plot course back for vulcan just in case spock is playing his lyre when the intercom whistles captain asked me to
let me alone let me alone he pounds his desk monitor into pulp unusual request
aware of that sir but it of the utmost importance you must give me permission to divert to vulcan
can sir but believe me wouldn make such request just putting itself together after long interplanetary conflict this inauguration will stabilise the entire altair system our appearance there is demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the klingon empire
sir the delay would be at most day can hardly believe that have your orders starfleet out
well that that
no it not know the altair situation we would be one of three starships very impressive very diplomatic but it simply not that vital
you can go off to vulcan against starfleet orders you ll be busted
can let spock die can bones and he will if we go to altair owe him my life dozen times over isn that worth career he my friend bridge navigation
bridge navigation
mister chekov lay in course for vulcan tell engineering want warp eight or better push her for all she ll take nurse chapel leaves sickbay beaming
course already plotted laying it in sir
see very well carry on mister chekov kirk out spock is lying on his bed apparently asleep christine thinks about touching him and then goes to leave
miss chapel
yes mister spock
had most startling dream you were trying to tell me something but couldn hear you it would be illogical for us to protest against our natures don you think
don understand
your face is wet
came to tell you that we are bound for vulcan we ll be there in just few days
vulcan miss chapel
my name is christine
yes know christine would you make me some of that plomeek soup
oh be very glad to do that mister spock
bridge
it is obvious that you have surmised my problem doctor my compliments on your insight captain there is thing that happens to vulcans at this time almost an insanity which you would no doubt find distasteful
will you ve been most patient with my kinds of madness
then would you beam down to the planet surface and stand with me there is brief ceremony
is it permitted
it is my right by tradition the male is accompanied by his closest friends
thank you mister spock
also request mccoy accompany me
shall be honoured sir
captain we re standing by on vulcan hailing frequencies sir
open the channel lieutenant vulcan space central this is the uss enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit granted and from all of vulcan welcome is commander spock with you
this is spock nurse chapel enters
doctor what going on the viewscreen lights up with the image of very beautiful woman
pring parted from me and never parted never and always touching and touched we meet at the appointed place and always touching and touched await you
she lovely mister spock who is she
she is pring my wife the trio have beamed down onto very red planet sky ground all shades of hot orange-red spock leads them into an area marked out by stone structures
this is the land of my family it has been held by us for more than two thousand earth years this is our place of koon-ut-kal-if-fee
he called it koon-ut what
he described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge in the distant past vulcans killed to win their mates
and they still go mad at this time perhaps the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time
it lovely wish the breeze were cooler
yeah hot as vulcan now understand what that phrase means
the atmosphere is thinner than earth spock strikes gong
wonder when his pring arrives
the marriage party approaches hear them
marriage party you said pring was your wife
by our parents arrangement ceremony while we were but seven years of age less than marriage but more than betrothal one touches the other in order to feel each other thoughts in this way our minds were locked together so that at the proper time we would both be drawn to koon-ut-kal-if-fee jingling sound gets louder and spock strikes the gong again two men enter shaking contraptions with lots of bells followed by woman carried on chair pring and others come behind her
bones you know who that is pau the only person to ever turn down seat on the federation council
pau officiating at spock wedding
he never mentioned that his family was this important pau chair is placed on dais and spock greets her she gives him quick mind-meld
spock are our ceremonies for outworlders
they are not outworlders they are my friends am permitted this she gestures for them to approach
this is kirk
ma am
and thee are called
leonard mccoy ma am
thee names these out worlders friends how does thee pledge their behaviour
with my life pau
what they are about to see comes down from the time of the beginning without change this is the vulcan heart this is the vulcan soul this is our way kah-if-farr spock is about to strike the gong again when pring intervenes
kal-if-fee
what is it what happened
she chooses the challenge
pointing at pau bodyguard with him
he acts only if cowardice is seen she will choose her champion
spock
do not attempt to speak with him kirk he is deep in the plak-tow the blood fever he will not speak with thee again until he has passed through what is to come if thee wishes to depart thee may leave now
we ll stay
spock chose his friends well
ma am don understand are you trying to say that she rejected him that she doesn want him
he will have to fight for her it is her right pring thee has chosen the kal-if-fee the challenge thee are prepared to become the property of the victor
am prepared
spock does thee accept the challenge according to our laws and customs single nod pring looks at the young man who followed her in
think spock can take him
doubt it not in his present condition
pring thee will choose thy champion
as it was in the dawn of our days as it is today as it will be for all tomorrows make my choice this one she steps past the expectant stonn and points at kirk
no am to be the one it was agreed
be silent
hear me have made the ancient claim claim the right the woman is
kroykah
ask forgiveness
kirk pring is within her rights but our laws and customs are not binding on thee thee are free to decline with no harm on thyself
pau
thee speaks
my friend does not understand
the choice has been made spock it is up to him now
he does not know will do what must pau but not with him his blood does not burn he is my friend
it is said thy vulcan blood is thin are thee vulcan or are thee human
burn pau my eyes are flame my heart is flame thee has the power pau in the name of my fathers forbid forbid pau plead with thee beg
thee has prided thyself on thy vulcan heritage it is decided
what happens to spock if decline
another champion will be selected do not interfere kirk keep thy place
you can do it jim
can
no she said their laws and customs were not binding on you
and you said spock might not be able to handle him if can knock spock out without really hurting him
in this climate if the heat doesn get you the thin air will you can do it
if get into any trouble ll quit and spock wins and honour is satisfied
jim listen if you
bones he my first officer and my friend disregarded starfleet orders to bring him here another thing that pau of vulcan all of vulcan in one package how can back out in front of her
it is done kirk decide
accept the challenge
here begins the act of combat for possession of the woman pring as it was at the time of the beginning so it is now bring forth the lirpa they are presented with wicked-looking half moon blades set in wooden shaft with counterweight at the other end
if both survive the lirpa combat will continue with the ahn woon
what do you mean if both survive
this combat is to the death
now wait minute ma am who said anything about fight to the death
these men are friends to force them to fight until one of them is killed
can forgive such display only once challenge was given and lawfully accepted it has begun let no one interfere and so the fight begins first with trial of brute strength then good swing by spock slices open kirk tunic and cuts his chest it is clear that the first officer will kill his captain given the chance when kirk is down and unarmed spock goes in for the final blow
spock no and kirk rolls away just in time then disarms spock
kroykah
is this vulcan chivalry the air too hot and thin for kirk he not used to it
the air is the air what can be done
holding up hypo can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this at least it ll give kirk fighting chance
thee may proceed
you re going to have to kill him jim
kill spock that not what came to vulcan for is it what that
it tri-ox compound it ll help you breathe now be careful
sound medical advice
the ahn woon the bells sound and both men are given long straps with weights and tassels on the ends spock demonstrates it use by lassoing kirk legs and knocking him down with it before holding it in the middle to use first as flail and finally to strangle his opponent
kroykah mccoy; get your hands off of him spock he finished he dead
grieve with thee
mccoy to enterprise
have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party ends communication as strange as it may seem mister spock you re in command now any orders
yes ll follow you up in few minutes you will instruct mister chekov to plot course for the nearest starbase where must surrender myself to the authorities the sound of transporter off screen pring explain
specify
why the challenge and why you chose my captain as your champion
stonn wanted me wanted him
see no logic in preferring stonn over me
you have become much known among our people spock almost legend and as the years went by came to know that did not want to be the consort of legend but by the laws of our people could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee there was also stonn who wanted very much to be my consort and wanted him if your captain were victor he would not want me and so would have stonn if you were victor you would free me because had dared to challenge and again would have stonn but if you did not free me it would be the same for you would be gone and would have your name and your property and stonn would still be there
logical flawlessly logical
am honoured
stonn she is yours after time you may find that having is not so pleasing thing after all as wanting it is not logical but it is often true spock here stand by to beam up live long pau and prosper
live long and prosper spock
shall do neither have killed my captain and my friend energize
doctor shall be resigning my commission immediately of course
spock
so would appreciate your making the final arrangements
spock
doctor please let me finish there can be no excuse for the crime of which guilty intend to offer no defence furthermore shall order mister scott to take immediate command of this vessel
don you think you better check with me first
captain jim there big big grin across his face which fades when mccoy and chapel own smiles are noticed
pleased to see you captain you seem uninjured am at something of loss to understand it however
blame mccoy that was no tri-ox compound he shot me with he slipped in neural paralyser knocked me out simulated death
indeed
nurse would you mind please chapel leaves in slight huff
spock what happened down there the girl the wedding
ah yes the girl most interesting it must have been the combat when thought had killed the captain found had lost all interest in pring the madness was gone intercom whistle
kirk here
captain kirk message from starfleet command top priority
relay it lieutenant
response to pau request for diversion of enterprise to planet vulcan granted komack admiral starfleet command
well little late but glad they re seeing it our way how about that pau they couldn turn her down mister chekov lay in course for altair six leave orbit when ready kirk out
there just one thing mister spock you can tell me that when you first saw jim alive that you weren on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down
merely my quite logical relief that starfleet had not lost highly proficient captain
yes mister spock understand
thank you captain
of course mister spock your reaction was quite logical
thank you doctor
in pig eye
come on spock let go mind the store
approaching planet omega four sir object ahead another vessel in planet orbit captain
lieutenant sound alert
aye sir all decks report ready sir
long range sensor scan mister sulu
it the uss exeter sir
try to contact her lieutenant
aye sir
the exeter she was patrolling in this area six months ago hadn heard of any trouble
receiving no response to our signal sir
the sensors indicate no damage to the vessel captain
see magnification factor three mister sulu the viewscreen shows sister ship to the enterprise orbiting the purple planet
hold our position out here mister sulu lieutenant have mister spock doctor mccoy and lieutenant galloway report to the transporter room we ll board and investigate
we re locked onto the exeter engineering section captain
phasers on heavy stun energise it dark and quiet
captain there red jacket draped across console with white crystals scattered in and around it
just their uniforms left
as if they were in them when
exactly when what mccoy scans the white crystals
this is captain kirk of the uss enterprise is anyone on board if there is and you can hear me please respond by intercom to the engineering section is there anyone on board
lieutenant galloway and are checking out the lower levels there seems to be no one aboard only uniforms
what about the shuttlecraft are still here if they left they didn leave that way
doctor mccoy and are going to the bridge meet us there captain log aboard the uss exeter commanded by ron tracey one of the most experienced captains in the starfleet what could have happened to him and the over four hundred men and women who were on this ship
the helm was left on automatic sir
fascinating
spock play the last log tape maybe they had time to record what happened to them
aye sir
jim the analysis of this so far is potassium thirty five percent carbon eighteen percent phosphorous one point zero calcium one point five jim the crew didn leave they re still here
what do you mean
these white crystals that what left of the human body when you take the water away which makes up ninety six percent of our bodies without water we re all just three or four pounds of chemicals something crystallised them down to this
have their surgeon log captain their last log entry captain on screen man in blue shirt is struggling to try and sit up in the captains chair and dictate the log men don go back to your own ship you have one chance get down there get down there fast captain tracey is screams and falls out of view
prepare to beam down to the planet surface fast he turns and looks down at the blue uniform lying on the floor where they saw the doctor fall the four beam into place with wooden construction fabric hangings on walls and beheading about to take place in the main square it takes three villagers to try and restrain the big man they want to kill and two to hold the woman who will follow him then someone sees the new arrivals
oi o1
put the axe away liyang
that ron tracey ron
knew someone would come looking for us just sorry it had to be you jim glad your arrival stopped this no more of this wu lock up the savages
they carry fire boxes
said lock up the savages the prisoners are called yangs impossible even to communicate with hordes of them out there they ll attack anything that moves
interesting that the villagers know about phasers
you were left alone down here ron what happened
our medi-scanners revealed this planet as perfectly harmless the villagers the kohms here were friendly enough once they got over the shock of my white skin as you ve seen we resemble the yangs the savages my landing party transported back to the ship stayed down here to arrange for the planet survey with the village elders the next thing knew the ship was calling me the landing party had taken an unknown disease back my crew jim my entire crew gone
yes know we saw it
and just as infected as they were as you are but stayed alive because stayed down here there some natural immunisation that protects everyone on the planet surface don know what it is
lucky we found that log if we gone back to the enterprise
you be dying by now along with the rest of the enterprise crew you ll stay alive only as long as you stay here none of us will ever leave this planet captain log supplemental the enterprise has left the exeter and moved into close planet orbit although it appears the infection may strand us here the rest of our lives face an even more difficult problem growing belief that captain tracey has been interfering with the evolution of life on this planet it seems impossible star captain most solemn oath is that he will give his life even his entire crew rather than violate the prime directive some equipment has been beamed down to the surface for medical tests
tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is three point zero zero four and could use second blood analyser unit
we ll beam it down shortly doctor
our tissues definitely show massive infection jim but something is immunising us down here thank heavens or we have been dead hours ago
don think we re going to have time to isolate it bones
the problem is it could be anything some spores or pollen in the air some chemical just finding it could take months maybe even years and ve only got one lead the infection resembles one developed by earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that spock bursts in helping an injured galloway who is clutching his chest
yang lance doctor
are you all right
bruised only we were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us we managed to escape without firing
spock do you see any hope that these yangs can be reasoned with truce parley
no captain they re too wild they act almost insane
captain tracey is being quite factual in several statements one the yangs are totally contemptuous of death they seem incredibly vicious two he is also being factual in that the yangs are massing for an attack there are signs of thousands of them in the foothills beyond however he was less than truthful in one very important matter
phaser power packs
captain tracey reserve belt packs empty found among the remains of several hundred yang bodies
the fool
smaller attack on this village week ago driven off by captain tracey with his phaser have found villagers who will corroborate it
now wait minute he lost his ship and his crew and he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of peaceful people
regulations are quite harsh but they re also quite clear captain if you do not act you will be considered equally guilty
without serum we re trapped here with the villagers now why destroy what left of the man by arresting him
agree that formal charges have little meaning now however you must at least confiscate his phaser
the fool starfleet should be made aware kirk gets out his communicator and tracey enters phaser ready and backed up by villagers
ll be sending the next message jim the injured galloway tries to reach for his own phaser and tracey vapourises him then the villagers take everyones equipment
enterprise come in
captain tracey of the exeter
yes sir captain kirk informed us earlier you had survived
afraid have some bad news your captain and landing party must have beamed down too late for full immunisation doing everything can for them now
sir this is lieutenant sulu in temporary command of the enterprise to beam down
there no point in risking more lives lieutenant since ve acquired some immunity perhaps the others
sulu wu hits him hard
at their next word kill him message
sorry lieutenant your captain feverish quite delirious that we have no problems here
ll contact you later let you know of any future needs landing party out later kirk is still lying on the floor with his hands tied behind him he still manages to trip up the pacing guard but then tracey comes in
that enough of that captain leave us the guard leaves
captain ronald tracey as per starfleet command regulation seven paragraph four
must now consider myself under arrest unless in the presence of the most senior fellow officers presently available give satisfactory answer to those charges which you now bring et cetera et cetera those were the first words duty required you to say to me and you said them you re covered now suppose we go on to the next subject
which is why meanwhile he is quietly loosening the leather thongs around his wrists
good direct succinct answer no native to this planet has ever had any trace of any kind of disease how long would man live if all disease were erased jim wu wu enters tell captain kirk your age
age have seen forty two years of the red bird my eldest brother
their year of the red bird comes once every eleven years which he seen forty two times multiply it wu is four hundred and sixty two years old his father is well over thousand interested jim
mccoy could verify all that
he will if you order it we must have doctor researching this are you grasping all it means this immunising agent here once we ve found it is fountain of youth virtual immortality or as much as any man will ever want
for sale by
to wu out wu leaves by those who own the serum mccoy will eventually isolate it meanwhile you inform your ship your situation impossible order them away when we re ready we ll bargain for whole fleet of ships to pick us up and they ll do it
yes suppose they would
we ve got to stay alive let the yangs kill us and destroy what we have to offer and we ll have committed crime against all humanity say that slightly more important than the prime directive wouldn you jim
it very interesting proposition let me think it over he got his hands free so now the two captains get to fight tracey wins
guards the yang man and woman are in one cell spock and mccoy in another when tracey brings in kirk at gunpoint
take the doctor back to his workplace the pointed-eared one stays and wu tell your men we ll be leaving soon we ll be in ambush for the yangs with many fire boxes this time what do you think of that jim kirk moves towards the yangs but the male tries to attack him through the bars
animals who happen to look like us you still think the prime directive for this planet
don think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere however planet is evolving
well if logic won work perhaps this will put him in there the guards use spears to keep the yangs from the door while they push kirk inside of course there is fight in the storeroom mccoy notices that his guard has fallen asleep the snoring is clue and tries to reach for possible weapon but the guard wakes up and stops him in the jail cell the two yangs are taking it in turns to keep kirk busy
don they ever rest
not that have observed captain of course should they wish to do so one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied
thank you spock grabs the woman to use her as shield but she bites his hand at least tell me why you want to kill me
good captain try to reason with them keep trying captain their behaviour is highly illogical
no point in repeating that it illogical spock quite aware of it the woman is finally within reach of spock neck pinch and down she goes the male is astonished and goes to protect her rather than keep fighting
pity you can teach me that
have tried captain young kohm woman brings mccoy plate of food
oh thank you thank you very much
captain have managed to loosen this grill somewhat if the mortar on yours is as old
can even get at it he be on me in moment the woman is awake again keep talking spock don let me doze off
captain tracey mentioned there was once considerable civilisation here the only reasonable explanation would be war nuclear devastation or bacteriological holocaust
that very interesting theory the yellow civilisation is almost destroyed the white civilisation is destroyed keep working on the window if we re ever going to regain our freedom
the male yang with very deep voice freedom freedom
spock
yes heard captain
that is worship word yang worship you will not speak it
well well well it is our worship word too
you live with the kohms
am not now prisoner of the kohms as you are kirk gets to the barred window and starts working on it cloud william helps him
why did you not speak until now
you spoke to kohms they are only for killing they get bar free kirk turns around
spock we ll have you out in minute cloud william knocks kirk out with the iron bar them rips the others out of the window to make his escape
captain captain captain are you able to respond later when kirk has regained consciousness
spock how long
seven hours and eight minutes captain
seven hours and eight spock keys on table ll have you out in minute there is scraping noise outside when the guard investigates he is overpowered by kirk and spock
good morning jim
good morning
we can contact the ship in few moments captain if can cross-circuit this unit
good did you find out anything
yes convinced that once there was frightening biological war that existed here the virus still exists then over the years nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food the water and the soil
war created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it
there is disease here something that affected the exeter landing party and us
that right these immunising agents take time and that the real tragedy had the exeter landing party stayed here just few hours longer they never would have died
then we can leave any time we want to tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become fountain of youth there are people here over thousand years old bones
survival of the fittest because their ancestors who survived had to have superior resistance then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars now if you want to destroy civilisation or whole world your descendants might develop longer life but hardly think it worth it
then anything you develop here as result of all this is useless
who knows it might eventually cure the common cold but lengthen lives poppycock can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly
ready captain quite crude voice communication will not be possible but we can signal the ship
all that bloodshed for nothing that ll be sufficient mister spock tracey appears at the door with his phaser and shoots spock
no messages kirk the savage in the cell with you did you set him free you sent him kirk you sent him to warn the tribes the yangs must ve been warned they sacrificed hundreds just to draw us out in the open and then they came and they came we drained four of our phasers and they still came we killed thousands and they still came
he ll live but ll have to get him to better facilities than this
impossible you can carry the disease up to the ship with you
he fully immunised now we all are
we can beam up at any time any of us
you ve isolated the serum
there no serum there are no miracles there no immortality here all this is for nothing
explain it to him doctor
leave medicine to medical men captain you found no fountain of youth here people live longer here now because it natural for them to
outside or ll burn down both your friends now
do what you can for him doctor
where is everybody
dead or in hiding now let see how eager you are to die call your ship need your help kirk they re going to attack the village my phaser almost drained we need new fresh ones you re not just going to stand there and let them kill you are you if put weapon in your hand you ll fight won you
we can beam up tracey all of us
want five phasers no ten with three extra power packs each
all right takes the communicator kirk to enterprise
captain are you all right now
yes quite all right like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs please have you got that
say again
enterprise do you read me
captain this is sulu we read you but surely you know that can be done
not even if we re in danger mister sulu
captain we have volunteers standing by to beam down what is your situation with tracey phaser almost up his nose
the situation is not immediately dangerous have the volunteers stand by kirk out
you have well-trained bridge crew captain my compliments kirk disarms tracey and they have another fight kirk runs through the village tracey regains his phaser and uses up its power disintegrating large pot before he corners kirk their final fight is stopped by spear-carrying yangs cloud william sits on chair in the place of honour there are romanesque statues of women around the walls and papers scattered on table in front of him the prisoners have their hands tied behind them and are seated along wall with plenty of guards
spock
weak captain but not in difficulty
he must have attention soon
my need for attention is vital doctor but our need for departure is even more immediate
if my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts the hills
yes see captain they would ve learned to wear skins adopted stoic mannerisms learned the bow and the lance
living like the indians and finally even looking like the american indian american yangs yanks spock yankees
kohms communists the parallel is almost too close captain it would mean they fought the war your earth avoided and in this case the asiatics won and took over this planet
but if it were true all these generations of yanks fighting to regain their land
you re romantic jim drummer enters cloud william stands
that which is ours is ours again it will never be taken from us again tattered flag is brought in with great ceremony red and white horizontal stripes with corner of white stars on blue background kirk and the others stand
they can be handled jim together it ll be easy caution you gentlemen don fight me here ll win or at worst ll drag you down with me
am cloud william chief also son of chief guardian of the holies speaker of the holy words leader of warriors many have died but this is the last of the kohm places what is ours is ours again he goes over to the flag and puts his left hand over his heart
aypledgli ianectu flaggen tupep kile for stahn
and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
he spoke the holy word kirk is brought forward to the table
you know many of our high-worship words how
in my land we have tribe like you
where is your tribe
up there one of those points of light that you see at night
why are you here were you cast out
you re confusing the stars with heaven
he was cast out don you recognise the evil one who else would trick you with your own sacred words let your god strike me dead if lie but he won because speak for him
yet you killed many yangs
you tried to kill me
we re not gods we re not evil ones we re men like yourselves
would man know your holy words would man use them to trick you see his servant his face his eyes his ears do the yang legends describe this servant of the evil one cloud william kisses large holy bible then opens it at haggai with picture of devil who looks very like spock
are your faces alike can you tell from them which of you is good and which of you is evil
you command him everyone seen that you want more proof he has no heart
his heart is different the internal organs of vulcan are
bring him he puts his ear to where human heart would be but vulcan heart is not
he has no heart
one of them lies
but which if we should kill the good evil would be among us
reaching for document there is way
greatest of holies chiefs and sons of chiefs may speak the words but the evil one tongue would surely turn to fire will begin you shall finish ee dplebnista norkohn forkohn perfectunun
those words are familiar wait moment
he fears to speak them for indeed his tongue would burn with fire force him kill his servant unless he speaks so you may see if the words burn him knife is put to spock throat
no wait there better way does not your sacred book promise that good is stronger than evil
the woman who had been captured with cloud william yes it is written good shall always destroy evil
it is written the room is cleared tracey and kirk have their left hands tied together cloud william stabs knife into the carpet at the other end of the room
the fight is done when one is dead
spock ve found that evil usually triumphs unless good is very very careful
hoola the fight begins with an exchange of punches then tracey tries to drag kirk towards the knife
spock we ve got to do something
am open to suggestions doctor kirk hooks his feet around table leg to stop tracey reaching the knife spock directs his attention towards the woman
what are you doing
making suggestion the two protagonists have nearly reached the weapon after struggle tracey gets it the woman picks up communicator walks over to spock then opens it kirk gets tracey to drop the knife and brings it down across his throat
kill him it is written good must destroy evil instead kirk cuts their bonds just as sulu and two security guards beam down
sir we picked up communicator signals but
we ll discuss that later lieutenant leslie free doctor mccoy and mister spock put captain tracey under arrest
aye sir cloud william sinks to his knees
now cloud william
you are great god servant we are your slaves kirk; get up face me
when you would not say the holy words of the ee plebnista doubted you
did not recognise those words you said them so badly without meaning
no no only the eyes of chief may see the ee plebnista
this was not written for chiefs general consternation hear me hear this among my people we carry many such words as this from many lands many worlds many are equally good and are as well respected but wherever we have gone no words have said this thing of importance in quite this way look at these three words written larger than the rest with special pride never written before or since tall words proudly saying we the people that which you call ee plebnista was not written for the chiefs or the kings or the warriors or the rich and powerful but for all the people down the centuries you have slurred the meaning of the words we the people of the united states in order to form more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution these words and the words that follow were not written only for the yangs but for the kohms as well
the kohms
they must apply to everyone or they mean nothing do you understand
do not fully understand one named kirk but the holy words will be obeyed swear it kirk leaves the yangs to gaze at the old papers with new eyes
there no question about his guilt captain but does our involvement here also constitute violation of the prime directive
we merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for liberty and freedom have to be more than just words gentlemen the fighting is over here suggest we leave them to discover their history and their liberty kirk takes one last look at the flag before leaving enterprise approaches space station
standard orbit captain
not now leslie lieutenant contact the space station
captain the station is calling us
all right put them on
yes commodore like an explanation already be in your transporter room
spock silver-haired man in command gold has beamed in
bob
are you surprised
ll say spock this is
commodore wesley how do you do sir
mister spock
all right ensign you can go thank you very much would you mind telling me what this is all about receive orders to proceed here no reason given informed that my men will be removed to the space station to security holding area think entitled to an explanation
you ve had singular honour conferred on you jim you re going to be the fox in the hunt
what that
war games ll be commanding the attack force against you
an entire attack force against my ship
have you heard of the m-5 multitronic unit
that doctor richard daystrom device isn it tell me about that
the most ambitious computer complex ever created its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard starship to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control
how do you know so much about it commander
hold an a-7 computer expert classification commodore well acquainted with doctor daystrom theories and discoveries the basic design of all our ship computers are doctor daystrom
what has all this got to do with the enterprise
you ve been chosen to test the m-5 jim there ll be series of routine research and contact problems for the m-5 to solve plus navigational manoeuvres and the war games problem if the m-5 works under actual conditions as well as it has under simulated tests it will mean revolution in space technology as great as warp drive when your crew has been removed the ship engineering section will be modified to contain the computer
why remove my crew
they re not needed
how much security does this gadget require
none doctor daystrom will see to the installation himself and he ll supervise the tests when he ready you ll receive your orders and proceed on the mission with crew of twenty
twenty can run starship with twenty crew
the m-5 can
and what am supposed to do
you ve got great job jim all you have to do is sit back and let the machine do the work captain log stardate 4729 the m-5 computer has been installed on board ship and we have left the space station for test manoeuvres
don like it jim vessel this size cannot be run by one computer
we are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man
maybe you re trying to prove that spock but don count me in on it
the most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon
very funny if it could they wouldn have to replace me resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks you know the type spock jim you haven had much to say about this
what do you want me to say m-5 is an honour they tell me well honoured
where is he scotty where doctor daystrom
he was here spots him behind console doctor
an imposing black man yes ah you be captain kirk
doctor daystrom this is my first officer mister spock
am honoured doctor
thank you thank you very much captain ve finished my tests on the m-5 and it must be hooked into your main power plants in order to be operative
well by all means do so
your engineer there wouldn allow us the power necessary without your orders
mister scott hook in the multitronic unit to the ship main power banks
sullenly aye aye sir mister harper
fascinating doctor this computer has potential beyond anything you ve ever done even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this
the m-5 has been perfected commander its potential is fact
frankly the only fact that concerned about is if this thing doesn work there are not enough men aboard to run the ship that begging for trouble
now who is this
doctor leonard mccoy senior medical officer
well sorry but this is security area
wouldn worry doctor doctor mccoy has clearance throughout the ship harper and scott connect the unit and the warp drives fluctuate
is it supposed to do that
if can be of assistance doctor
no no no thank you can manage there nothing wrong captain just few minor settling-in adjustments to make as you can see all is in order now
curious doctor why is it called m-5 and not m-1
well you see the multitronic units one through four were not entirely successful this one is m-5 is ready to take control of the ship
total control
that is what it was designed for captain
there are certain things men must do to remain men your computer would take that away
there are other things man like you might do or perhaps you object to the possible loss of prestige and ceremony accorded starship captain computer can do your job and without all that
you ll have to prove that to me doctor
that is what we re here for isn it captain kirk eyes narrow and he leaves followed by mccoy
did you see the love light in spock eyes the right computer finally came along what the matter jim
think that thing is wrong and don know why
think it wrong too replacing men with mindless machines
don mean that getting red alert right here the back of his head that thing is dangerous feel hesitates only fool would stand in the way of progress if this is progress you have my psychological profiles am afraid of losing my job to that computer
jim we ve all seen the advances of mechanisation after all daystrom did design the computers that run this ship
under human control
we re all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to machine when it comes to your job that different and it always will be different
am afraid of losing command to computer daystrom right can do lot of other things am afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being starship captain is that why fighting it am that petty
jim if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question you don need me to answer it for you why don you ask james kirk he pretty honest guy the captain chair has new box with two switches and two lights on it kirk flips the switches
the m-5 computer is now disengaged
we re coming back on our original course captain
m-5 has performed admirably so far
all it done is make the required course changes and some simple turns mister sulu and mister chekov could ve done that with their eyes closed
yes but you see the idea is they didn have to do it and you ll find it won be necessary for you to regain control of the unit after it completed each manoeuvre
my orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the m-5 is in control ll run the ship in my own way if you don mind doctor daystrom
captain am forced to agree with doctor daystrom with the course information plotted into it his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator in fact it might have been further demonstration of m-5 capability
you seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer
enjoy captain no merely gratified to see doctor daystrom new unit execute everything required of it in such highly efficient manner m-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career
approaching alpha carinae two eta five minutes
captain your orders at this point are not open to interpretation you must commit the m-5 to handle its approach the orbit and then to analyse data regarding landing party recommendations
if you don mind ll make my own recommendations
well if you feel you need the exercise go on captain
m-5 is committed enterprise approaches the planet
standard orbit mister sulu
captain the m-5 has calculated that the orbit is already plotted
oh yes
standard orbit achieved captain
report mister spock
the planet is class captain oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support two major land masses number of islands life form readings
captain power shutdowns on deck four lights environmental control
check it out scotty
handing over computer disc m-5 readout captain
all right my recommendations are as follows we send down general survey party avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet surface the survey party will consist of myself doctor mccoy astrobiologist phillips geologist rawlins and science officer spock
play m-5 recommendations won you mister spock
male computer voice m-5 readout planet alpha carinae two class atmosphere oxygen-nitrogen
the power gone off on deck five
categorisation of life form readings recorded recommendations for general survey party science officer spock astrobiologist phillips geologist carstairs
well the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel that only matter of judgment
judgment captain
captain the computer does not judge it makes logical selections
why pick carstairs instead of rawlins carstairs is an ensign no experience this is his first tour of duty rawlins is chief geologist
aren you really more interested in why m-5 did not select you and doctor mccoy well let find out anyway m-5 tie-in
m-5
explanation for landing party recommendation
general survey party requires direction of science officer astrobiologist phillips has surveyed twenty nine biologically similar planets geologist carstairs served on merchant marine freighters in this area once visited planet on geology survey for mining company
why were the captain and the chief medical officer not included in recommendation
non-essential personnel
captain ve located the source of the power shutdowns it the m-5 unit sir that thing turning off systems all over the ship
have you located the malfunction doctor
as suspected it is not malfunction m-5 was merely shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it decks four and six are living quarters are they not
yes that correct
and currently unoccupied
am not familiar with these instruments doctor you are using an entirely new type of control mechanism however it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before
quite right as the unit is called upon to do more work it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still
doctor this unit is not human body the computer can process information but only the information which is put into it
granted it can work thousand million times faster than the human brain but it can make value judgment it hasn intuition it can think
can you understand the multitronic unit is revolution in computer science designed the duotronic elements used in your ship right now and know they are as archaic as dinosaurs compared to the m-5 whole new approach
kirk here what is it yet unidentified
ll be right up
what are you doing here bones
all the sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the m-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for
captain sensors report two contacts now one on the port bow one on the stern distance two hundred thousand kilometres and closing
identification
captain the m-5 unit has already identified the vessels as federation starships excalibur and lexington
we are not scheduled for war games in this area this may be surprise attack as problem for the m-5
priority message coming in sir
put it on audio daystrom enters the bridge this is an unscheduled m-5 drill repeat this is an m-5 drill enterprise acknowledge on this frequency
acknowledge lieutenant
m-5 has acknowledged for us sir
then go to red alert
aye sir captain m-5 has
already sounded the red alert all right mister sulu phasers one one hundredth power no damage potential just enough to nudge them
phasers one one hundredth power sir
phaser hit on port deflector four captain
speed increasing to warp three turning now to one one two mark five phasers locking on target sir
enemy vessel closing with us
main phasers firing hit sir two more
changing course to two eight mark four two pavel feels as fed up and useless as kirk as the machine does his job for him
phasers firing again
turning to one one three mark five warp four speed
firing again
attacking vessels are moving off
moving back to original course and speed
report on damage sustained in mock attack
minor hit on deflector screen four no appreciable damage
rather impressive display for machine wouldn you say captain
evaluation of m-5 performance it ll be necessary for the log
the ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her tactics deployment of weapons all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control
machine over man spock it was impressive it might even be practical
practical captain perhaps but not desirable computers make excellent and efficient servants but have no wish to serve under them captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man and nothing can replace it or him
captain message now coming in from commodore wesley
put it on visual excalibur both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to enterprise
secure from general quarters captain dunsel wesley out
dunsel who the blazes is captain dunsel everyone else knows what does it mean jim kirk leaves the bridge spock what does it mean
dunsel doctor is term used by midshipmen at starfleet academy it refers to part which serves no useful purpose kirk is working on device when mccoy comes in with covered tray
not interested in eating bones
this isn chicken soup may be just ship doctor but make finagle folly that known from here to orion strongly prescribe it jim they each take liqueur glass with dark green liquid
ve ve never felt this way before at odds with the ship sat there and watched my ship perform for mass of circuits and relays and felt useless unneeded to captain dunsel
to james kirk captain of the enterprise
thank you doctor drinks that one of your better prescriptions
simple but effective
do you know the one all ask is tall ship
it line from poem very old poem isn it
20th century earth all ask is tall ship and star to steer by you could feel the wind at your back in those days the sounds of the sea beneath you and even if you take away the wind and the water it still the same the ship is yours you can feel her and the stars are still there bones
kirk here
unidentified this is not drill
on my way
captain there no response to any of our signals but m-5 has given us an autorelay
m-5 has identified her captain the woden listed in starfleet registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation no crew coming into visual range
captain deflector shields just came on
speed increasing to warp three captain
lieutenant get daystrom up here disengaging m-5 unit cut speed to warp one navigator go to course one one three mark seven want that ship given wide berth
she won respond sir she maintaining course
going to warp four sir
jim
scotty reverse engines slow us down
reverse thrusts will not engage sir manual override isn working either
no effect on any of the m-5 controls captain
fantastic machine the m-5 no off switch
enters captain what is it
these controls are locked we can disengage the computer
captain photon torpedoes locking on target full power kirk leaps to sulu console and starts flicking switches
already tried sir
daystrom release that computer control photon torpedoes are fired destroying the woden
returning to original course and speed
all systems report normal captain
normal that thing trying to tell us nothing has happened
disengage this computer now
there appears to be some defect in the control panel
there certainly does your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter in fact it went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter
fortunately it was only robot ship
but it shouldn have destroyed anything there might just as easily have been crew aboard that ship
in which case you be guilty of murder
bones disengage the computer lieutenant contact starfleet command tell them we are breaking off m-5 tests and returning to the space station come along doctor daystrom m-5 is out of job
all right daystrom let turn this thing off but as he approaches the unit he is thrown sideways by green forcefield
force field
it not my doing kirk
would say captain that m-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship it is also capable of taking care of itself
you mean it not going to let any of us turn it off captain log stardate 4731 the m-5 multitronic unit has taken over total control of the enterprise
all right doctor you built this thing how do you propose to turn it off
this exercise is trial for m-5 shakedown we must expect minor difficulties but assure you they can be corrected
correct it after you release control of my ship
can
captain suggest we disconnect it at the source
give me few moments with it
no stay here all right scotty turn it off scott and an engineer get the device they use to attach m-5 power supply to the ship and head over to the junction box but as soon as the engineer steps in between m-5 and it power he is disintegrated
that wasn minor difficulty that wasn robot that thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can turn it off
it wasn deliberate act m-5 analysis told it it needed new power source the ensign simply got in the way
and how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way
m-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines tapping the matter-antimatter reserves
so now it has virtually unlimited power captain what ll we do
spock scotty come with me
report spock
the multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines the computer now controls all helm navigation and engineering functions
and communications and fire control
we ll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour we must regain control of the ship by then
there is one possibility the automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three
scotty
aye can take them out and cut in the manual override from there
how long
if mister spock helps me maybe an hour
make it less
ll get the man responsible in the first place where is daystrom
he with the m-5 unit watching it think it surprised even him
most illogical of all people he should have known how the computer would perform of course the m-5 itself has not behaved logically
please spock do me favour and don say it fascinating
no but it is interesting mccoy rolls his eyes
aye that got it mister spock
good
have you found solution way to shut that thing off
you don shut child off when it makes mistake m-5 is growing learning
learning to kill
to defend itself it quite different thing when child is taught it programmed with simple instructions and at some point if its mind develops properly it exceeds the sum of what it was taught thinks independently
that thing is danger to us all now find some way to shut it off
you can understand you re frightened because you can understand it going to show you going to show all of you it takes four hundred thirty people to man starship with this you don need anyone one machine can do all those things they send men out to do now men no longer need die in space or on some alien world men can live and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and dying for galactic space which is neither ours to give or to take they can understand we don want to destroy life we want to save it
the biographical tape of richard daystrom
did you find anything
not much aside from the fact he genius
genius is an understatement at the age of twenty four he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the nobel and zee-magnes prizes
in his early twenties jim that over quarter of century ago
isn that enough for one lifetime
maybe that the trouble where do you go from up you publish articles you give lectures then spend your life trying to recapture past glory
all right it difficult what your point
the m-1 through m-4 remember not entirely successful that the way daystrom put it
genius doesn work on an assembly line basis did einstein kazanga or sitar of vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on regular schedule you can simply say today will be brilliant no matter how long it took he came out with multitronics the m-5
right the government bought it then daystrom had to make it work and he did but according to spock it works illogically
and he won let spock near it what are you saying that he tampering with it that he making it act that way why
jim if man had child who gone antisocial killed perhaps he still tend to protect that child
now he got you talking about that machine like personality
afraid that the way he thinks about it
kirk here
good get daystrom we re on our way let go
what is it captain
we re going to find out doctor at the foot of the jefferies tube
spock
mister scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter as he does so shall trip the manual override into control
good go ahead
no no no no you can take control from the m-5 he tries to get into the jefferies tube and kirk struggles to restrain him
daystrom we re going to do our best
you can do it now let me work with it for while please please
spock
that it mister spock
please please
manual override is in control captain
bridge this is kirk sulu
we ve got helm and navigational control turn us about have mister chekov plot course back to the space station
right away sir you heard him
ve been updating that course for hours but they flip switches in vain
kirk here
captain helm doesn respond navigational controls still locked in by m-5
mister chekov
go to the engineering station also the nine five systems
sir nine five system appears dead
thank you ensign
it appears captain we ve been doing what used to be called pursuing wild goose m-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls bypassing this primary system
but it was active stake all that know that it was
believe that when m-5 discovered our tampering it rerouted the controls leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals
decoyed it wanted us to waste our time
while it was getting ready for what spock
do not know it is not performing in logical manner
doctor daystrom doctor daystrom want an answer right now tired of hearing about the m-5 new approach what is it exactly what is it
do not mean to offend sir but it behaves with an almost human pattern
well doctor
yes quite right mister spock you see one of the arguments against computers controlling ships was that they couldn think like men
your new approach
exactly ve developed method of impressing human engrams upon the computer circuits the relays are not unlike the synapse of the brain m-5 thinks captain to the bridge please
kirk here what is it
sir sensors are picking up four federation starships m-5 is altering course to intercept
the main attack force the war games
but m-5 doesn know it game
correction bones those four ships don know it m-5 game and m-5 is going to destroy them four starships just like enterprise are in formation as kirk spock and mccoy arrive on the bridge
enterprise to uss lexington come in lexington sir can raise them m-5 is blocking all frequencies including automatic distress just minute sir captain getting audio signal from the lexington
put it on repeat this is an m-5 drill acknowledge
captain m-5 is acknowledging
daystrom does m-5 understand that this is only drill
of course it was programmed to understand captain the ore ship was miscalculation an accident don know
sir deflector shield just came on speed increasing to warp four
phasers locking on lead ship sir power levels at full strength
full strength
if that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships we re in
that no miscalculation
attack force closing rapidly breaking formation attacking at will
our phasers are firing sir
hit on the lexington
full phasers what the devil is kirk doing damage report lieutenant helm course one six four mark three
turning now sir
estimate damage on lexington spock
hit in engineering section possible damage to her impulse engines she still maneuverable on warp drive
we re firing again sir
the excalibur direct hit
closing on the lexington again sir the hood and potemkin are moving off
phasers firing captain
lexington hit again
there got to be way of getting to the m-5 there got to be way
there isn it fully protected itself
probably true captain it works faster thinks faster than we do it is human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in computer
captain visual contact with lexington you trying to prove break off the attack jim we have fifty three dead here twelve on the excalibur if you can hear us stop the attack
lieutenant
sorry can override m-5 interference in jim
there your murder charge deliberate calculated it killing men and women four starships sixteen hundred men and women
it misunderstood
excalibur is maneuvering away sir we re increasing speed to follow
phasers locked on
daystrom
phasers firing
really don know how to get to the m-5 really do not know
doctor daystrom you impressed human engrams on the m-5 circuits
coming to new course sir bearing on the potemkin
phasers firing hit
whose engrams
why mine of course
of course
then perhaps you could talk to the unit m-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it
the computer tie-in you spoke to it before it knows you
captain getting the lexington again tapping in on their message to starfleet command sir excalibur captain harris and first officer dead many casualties we have damage but are still able to manoeuvre the enterprise refuses to answer and is continuing attack still have an effective battle force and believe the only way to stop the enterprise is to destroy her request permission to proceed wesley commanding attack force out
they can do that they ll destroy the m-5
you can save the m-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack
can make it stop created it goes to spock station m-5 tie-in
m-5
this is calmer this is daystrom
daystrom acknowledged
m-5 do you know me
daystrom richard originator of comptronic duotronic systems born
stop m-5 your attack on the starships is wrong you must break it off
don like the sound of him jim
you better pray that the m-5 listens to the sound of him
programming includes protection against attack enemy vessels must be neutralised
but these are not enemy vessels these are federation starships you re killing we are killing murdering human beings beings of our own kind you were not created for that purpose you are my greatest creation the unit to save men you must not destroy men
this unit must survive
survive yes protect yourself but not murder you must not die men must not die to kill is breaking of civil and moral laws we ve lived by for thousands of years you ve murdered hundreds of people we ve murdered how can we repay that
they attacked this unit programming includes full freedom to choose defensive actions in all attack situations
quietly spock the m-5 is not responding to him like computer it talking to him
am most impressed with the technology captain doctor daystrom has created mirror image of his mind
consideration of all programming is that we must survive
we will survive nothing can hurt you gave you that you are great am great twenty years of groping to prove the things done before were not accidents seminars and lectures to rows of fools who couldn begin to understand my systems colleagues colleagues laughing behind my back at the boy wonder and becoming famous building on my work building on my work
jim he on the edge of nervous breakdown if not insanity
the m-5 must be destroyed
destroyed kirk no we re invincible look what we ve done your mighty starships four toys to be crushed as we choose spock neck-pinches daystrom
security take him to sickbay daystrom is carried off the bridge
fascinating
take care of him doctor mccoy leaves
battle status
the other three ships are holding station out of range the excalibur looks dead
captain lexington is receiving message from starfleet they
go on destroy the enterprise acknowledge lexington
they ve just signed their own death warrant m-5 will kill them to survive
every living thing wants to survive captain daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer
suppose it still open to impression suppose it absorbed the regret daystrom felt for the deaths it caused the guilt
captain the ships are coming within range again
commodore wesley is dedicated commander should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death
the instrument of his death will not be the enterprise if can help it m-5 tie-in
m-5
this is captain kirk you will be under attack in moment
sensors have recorded approach of ships
you have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled many lives were lost
the ships attacked this unit this unit must survive
why
this unit is the ultimate achievement in computer evolution it will replace man so man may achieve man must not risk death in space or other dangerous occupations this unit must survive so man may be protected
captain attack force almost within phaser range
there were many men aboard those ships they were murdered must you survive by murder
this unit cannot murder
why
murder is contrary to the laws of man and god
but you have murdered scan the starship excalibur which you destroyed is there life aboard
no life
because you murdered it what is the penalty for murder
death
and how will you pay for your acts of murder
this unit must die it disconnects itself from the power feed in engineering and goes dark
m-5
sir deflector shields have dropped
all phaser power gone sir
m-5 is leaving itself open to attack the machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder
scotty spock before it changes its mind get down to engineering pull out every hook up that makes m-5 run pull out the plug spock scott and spock leave
lieutenant
aye sir
intership communications this is the captain speaking in approximately one minute we ll be attacked by federation starships the m-5 no longer controls the ship but neither do we control it the m-5 has left itself and us open for destruction for whatever satisfaction we may get from the knowledge our nineteen lives will buy the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen
phasers on target
kirk here
the force field is gone captain m-5 is neutralised
system coming back can give you power for the shields sir
need communications
that ll take longer
sir
cut power keep those shields down
the enterprise looks dead going to take chance he not just laying trap wesley to attack force
captain her shields repeat hold attack do not fire
he ll have to be committed to total rehabilitation centre right now he under sedation and heavy restraints
would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition
that exactly the situation was hoping for when forced the m-5 to realise it had committed murder the group walk out of the medical bay to mccoy office
daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of god and man the computer that carried his engrams also believed it
captain why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the enterprise apparently vulnerable logically that is the sort of trap m-5 should have set
wasn sure any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us but knew bob wesley they walk out into the
gambled on his humanity and into the
bridge his logical selection was compassion
compassion that the one thing no machine ever had maybe it the one thing that keeps men ahead of them care to debate that spock
no doctor simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings not better
but tell me which do you prefer to have around
presume your question is meant to offer me choice between machines and human beings and believe have already answered that question
was just trying to make conversation spock
it would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on computer doctor the resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining
mister sulu take us back to the space station ahead warp factor two
still no response sir
no keep it open don like this nothing since the first check in scott and sulu should ve contacted us again half an hour ago
they may have nothing to report our sensors indicate no life forms except our landing party
both those men are well aware of landing party procedure they should ve checked in with us by now
contact established captain
enterprise kirk here
one jackson where are scott and sulu
jackson
sorry can clear it captain
notify transporter room to prepare to beam up one member of the landing party then have doctor mccoy report to me in the transporter room on the double
yes sir
ready sir
energise
what on jim
trouble one man materialises jackson where are the others the man falls over and off the transporter platform
the man is dead there is curse on your ship leave this place or you will all die captain log stardate 3018 crewman jackson is dead and there are no apparent physical causes mister scott and mister sulu are still out of touch on the planet below leaving assistant chief engineer desalle in command of the enterprise beaming down to the planet surface to find my two missing crewmen and discover what killed jackson it rocky and misty very spooky
odd our probe data didn indicate fog
no cloud formations no bodies of water no changes in surface temperature under these conditions fog is highly unlikely captain according to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location from which jackson was beamed up to the ship they step down carefully into the mist swirling along the path
readings mister spock
no indications of moment captain picking up life form readings twenty four degrees mark seven range one thirty seven point one six metres multiple readings captain
scott and sulu
kirk to enterprise
what are the ship sensors reading now lieutenant
report mister
am only picking up physical impulses from the three of them as far as instruments can make out there is nothing else down there that alive
relay lieutenant
captain we are only registering on you static captain captain kirk
lieutenant can you hear me
whatever this stuff is it getting thicker suppose that has anything to do with the interference
don know there has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship sensors can register anything but us while we re picking up readings of multiple life forms are they still there spock
no change captain
stand-by alert they check their phasers
listen now what do you think that
quiet there an eerie wailing then the images of well the three witches from macbeth appear
captain kirk
captain kirk
captain kirk
who are you
go back
go back
go back remember the curse
wind shall rise
and fog descend
so leave here all or meet your end maniacal cackling as they vanish
spock comment
very bad poetry captain
more useful comment mister spock
what we ve just seen is not real
that useful
however on azimuth twenty four at just over one hundred metres there are definitely life forms erratic confused but definitely registering
that where we re going strong gust of wind blows them back
that was pretty real illusion mister spock they walk on again
jim there is castle hewn from the local rock and door is opening
this is the source of the life form readings captain they re inside somewhere
kirk to enterprise enterprise come in
is this how we lost contact with the first landing party
what about it spock does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference
would say not captain there no indication of anything that would cause such interference
and it doesn pick up on our ship sensors
nor do our sensors register the life forms inside
could it be exerting force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan
then it would affect spock tricorder too wouldn it kirk; would it wonder they approach the edifice cautiously then enter they are greeted by an angry spitting black cat wearing large gem on its collar it runs off tail bristling
three witches what appears to be castle and black cat
if we weren missing two officers and third one dead say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us
trick or treat captain
yes mister spock you be natural ll explain it to you one day shall we have look around
that would seem to be in order
sending them off in different directions bones spock
they re gone mister desalle the captain and the others simply stopped registering
check for malfunctions
did sir as soon as it happened
mister desalle that exactly what happened to mister scott and his party they they just disappeared
nobody just disappears they may have encountered magnetic field or some other obstruction mister chekov recalibrate your sensors if you need help
can do it sir not that green
lieutenant uhura continue in your efforts to break through that static interference
aye aye sir
we know they re down there want them found the main door slams shut behind them
straight ahead mister spock
the readings would so indicate unlike real castle this one is all corridors at present
dust cobwebs halloween is right the black cat is ahead of them when the stone floor gives way and dumps the trio into reasonably well equipped out of edgar allen poe rack skeleton in iron cage and our heroes chained to the wall
spock are you all right
yes am undamaged captain
bones sees another skeleton chained to the wall doc
you were saying something about trick or treat
dungeons curses skeletons and iron maidens they re all earth manifestations why
do not know captain but these things do exist they are real
could this be an earth parallel development of some sort
none of this parallels any human development it more like human nightmare
as if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level
ghost stories ogres demons the whole footsteps then the dungeon door opens down the steps walk scott and sulu as if in trance
scotty sulu scotty put down the phaser scotty
they appear to be drugged jim look at their eyes hardly blink at all
neither did jackson just before he collapsed
these two are alive scotty do you hear me sulu do you know who am what happened to you sulu holds up very big key ring
they re going to release us sulu undoes their shackles and they start to leave they begin to fight but suddenly
stop red plush furnishings and bald man with little beard wearing golden gown is sitting on what is effectively throne on raised dais
whoever you are you ve proven your skill at creating illusion now want to know why and what you ve done to my men
where did your race get this ridiculous predilection for resistance you examine any object you question everything is it not enough to accept what is
not when one of my men is dead because of it and two others turned into mindless
no not mindless these two are merely controlled captain kirk oh yes we know who you are all of you to the cat don we my precious
who are you why did you bring us here
my name is korob and as for bringing you here it was you who quite contrarily insisted upon coming you were warned to stay away
why for what reason why all the mumbo-jumbo
mumbo-jumbo the cat meows as if explaining oh oh no assure you it was not that captain
mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before there never have been any life forms on pyris seven
it is of no importance that we are not native to this planet meow oh told that ve been an inattentive host gentlemen you will join me for something to refresh yourselves he leaves his throne and the cat follows
that cat
that cat
there are ancient earth legends about wizards and their familiars
familiars
demons in animal forms sent by satan to serve the wizard
superstition
do not create the legend captain merely report it
you are the different one mister spock you do not think like the others there are no colours to your patterns of logic there only black and white you see all this around you yet you do not believe
he doesn know about trick or treat
do not understand that reference therefore it also is of no importance gentlemen can be most hospitable he waves his wand and the table is loaded with food
ingenious
do be seated
we re not hungry
but insist they seat themselves
all right korob what do you want from us
for the moment merely that you eat and enjoy oh doctor do try the wine you ll find it excellent
you ll find us most unco-operative unless you start explaining yourself
hopefully can change that attitude the food vanishes and their plates are now filled with cut gemstones
these look real
they are assure you diamonds rubies emeralds sapphires all the crystalline forms that you cherish above all things fortune of them for each of you if you leave here without further inquiry
we could manufacture ton of these on our ship they mean nothing to us
valueless don understand read
whatever it is you read you read it wrong as for leaving we ll leave when we re ready
you are most unpredictable perhaps have made small mistake nevertheless you have passed the tests
tests
yes our analysis of you may have been in some small way in error but you were warned to stay away and yet you came to save your comrades that proves loyalty your bravery was tested and you did not frighten and despite my failure with these bright baubles perceive that you cannot be bribed in many ways you are quite admirable meow quite right go at once yes the cat leaves and few moments later dark haired woman in loose black dress enters the room she is wearing pendant like the cat collar
gentlemen my colleague sylvia
doctor mccoy mister spock and captain kirk you wanted to know what we did to your men actually it simple matter for us to probe the minds of creatures like yourself
mind probing hypnosis
you like to think of yourselves as complex creatures but you re flawed one gains admittance to your minds through many levels you have too many to keep track of yourselves there are unguarded entrances to any human mind
telepathy
not entirely no telepathy doesn imply control and assure you that have full control over your friends kirk gets the phaser off scott by throwing gems in his face
don move hands it to spock cover them now want the rest of our weapons and our equipment want some answers
put that weapon down captain it seems so foolish of you to insist on demonstrations she holds up model enterprise on chain in the mythology of your race this is called sympathetic magic jackson the crew member who returned to the ship you wondered what killed him made an image of him in the essence of my thoughts the image was jackson and when killed the image and knew that it was dead he died
you can think man to death
your communicator it appears on the table now signal your ship she moves the model into candle flame
don sylvia don
kirk to enterprise come in come in the ship is at red alert
captain are you all right where are you are the others all right sir
never mind about us what happening up there
the temperature sir it keeps rising reading mister
it up sixty degrees in the past thirty seconds we re burning up sir
desalle channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units cooking up here
all right ll handle it down here kirk out taking the model from sylvia and the phaser from spock you ve won
you can relax now captain your ship is safe
temperature is almost back to normal dropping down fast
lieutenant try to raise the captain again
enterprise to captain kirk come in please enterprise to captain kirk acknowledge we ve lost him again mister desalle
captain you ve seen something of our science now tell us about yours
you seem to be singing different tune rather know more about yours you call it magic you call it science it seems unrelated to both of them
what would you name it captain
wouldn attempt to name it but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools you alter matter move it about by telekinesis
yes we can change the molecular structure
korob you talk too much
you kept scott and sulu as catspaws to lure us down here how you know we come
oh we didn have to know they knew
enough of this you will tell us what we want to know
it too late for threats you let me contact the ship how long do you think it will it be before search party arrives
some time captain quite some time the model enterprise is encased in block of perspex
there will be no search party captain kirk an impenetrable force field around your ship captain it will not hinder orbit but your people are prisoners within it
it some kind of force field sir but not like any other ve ever heard of before it not coming from anywhere it simply all around us
would advise you to co-operate captain forcible extraction of the information we wish from you is not complicated but it is extremely painful and it has certain draining effect
we have nothing to discuss
take them to their cell gives the phaser to scott
wait the doctor will stay your turn will be next captain it makes little difference take them out of here
wave length analysis mister chekov
it will not analyse sir
all right but it there and it real if it real it can be affected engineering stand by to divert all power systems to the outer hull prepare impulse engines for generation of maximum heat directed as ordered maybe we can break it but ll bet you credits to navy beans we can put dent in it kirk and spock are shackled to the wall again
how long has it been
twenty two minutes seventeen seconds
thanks wonder what they re doing to doc
sure we ll find out shortly jim all of these things that we ve seen to an earthman like yourself they must seem quite familiar
familiar startling not rational
precisely refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious the universal myths symbols
ghosts witches
and dungeons and castles and black cats they all belong to the twilight world of consciousness
they tried to tap our conscious mind
and they missed they reached basically only the subconscious korob seemed puzzled by your reaction to the environment he provided
he expected me to react as though it were all normal well he admitted that they weren native to this planet
and not to have knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we ve met in this galaxy
they refer to us as creatures as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with if we re creatures wonder what they re really like
evidently something totally alien in all respects
agreed totally alien and don like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy our world spock not at all like friendly visitors we re going to have to stop them cold but at the moment
too am at loss at this time to suggest course of action the door opens and mccoy enters with scott and sulu he has been zombified sulu unchains kirk
oh bones doc
you forget what we were sent here for
forget nothing not puppet korob like you
you re traitor
you are fool we have nothing like this and like it to touch to feel to understand the idea of luxury like it and don intend to leave it
we have duty to the old ones
what do they know of sensations this is new world
you re cruel you torture our specimens
and that too is new sensation find it stimulating
you re wrong you re discarding everything we live by
live by my own decisions you re weak fool korob
have the power
but you re afraid to use it don threaten me can squash you and that would be an interesting sensation yes find like these new sensations don try to push me the door opens and the group enters
captain it time for our talk korob leave us alone and take these men with you korob picks up the communicator and enterprise from the table
this is not ended sylvia
but it may end soon old man he leaves followed by mccoy scott and sulu
what now you wave your magic wand and destroy my mind too
there no real damage to the mind captain simply drain of knowledge and will
you don call that damage
why should
you know if you had compassion woman should have compassion but forget you re not woman
but you re mistaken captain am woman now come from world without sensation as you and now know it it excites me want more
you seem to need us why
because you have knowledge which lack but were our abilities put together tell me about power captain how does it feel as korob watches from behind screen kirk puts his hand on her shoulder he strokes her neck and face
what about korob
he is fool ll do without him but you why do find you different why would it be so difficult to dispose of you
why don you simply probe my mind and get what you want
no not that not for you what want is joining my mind to yours willingly think of the secrets you could learn think of the power that would be yours anything you can imagine can give you
you re very persuasive what happens if go along
then everything would be ours together ve never conceived of the idea of togetherness before it excites me you excite me why
for the same reasons you excite me you re very beautiful woman he kisses her
you find me beautiful but can be many women now she blonde teen jail-bait you like what you see platinum blonde in loose cat-suit or do you prefer me as was
you have knack for giving me difficult choices kisses her again you have nothing like that where you come from
nothing
your people when they come here
they re like like feathers in the wind without the transmuter
nuzzling her neck transmuter
the source you will learn will teach you later later
then it device you do use tools
it gives only form you re teaching me substance
you haven changed your mind you won return home
my home is here with you billion worlds of sensation to pick and choose another kiss then he lets her go and she realises
you are using me you hold me in your arms and there is no fire in your mind you re trying to deceive me it here the crystal like words on page you are using me
and why not you ve been using me and my crew enter sulu scott and mccoy
you will be swept away you your men your ship your worlds
don see any change
it there lieutenant
it was that electrical field we set up mister desalle that dent you wanted it not much but it is start
keep it up mister chekov channel the entire output of reactors one two and three into the relay stations whatever it is it starting to weaken korob rushes in and releases the prisoners
ve released the model of your ship from the crystal although they would have freed themselves soon it difficult to control so many things in so little time hands over phaser and communicator here you must go before she finds the weapon is missing
not leaving without my men
they re not your men anymore they belong to sylvia can no longer control them or her she irrational the strain of adopting to your form the insatiable desire for sensation and experience she great danger and it was not necessary we could have entered your galaxy in peace
you came in ship
we used the transmuter
transmuter yes she mentioned that
there no time to explain now she means to destroy us all there might still be chance quickly come they go cautiously along the corridors and cat snarl is heard there on wall is the shadow of very large feline
fascinating
why cat
racial memories the cat is the most ruthless most terrifying of animals as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger
think can stop her
you better let us draws the phaser it out of energy she must have drained it we could have jumped scott and sulu at any time we didn know no way out
it my problem she one of my kind come quickly the giant cat pads down the corridor as they retreat back into the dungeon spock goes to the hole in the ceiling that they originally fell through
do you think you can make it
ready when you are captain
to korob get ready spock gets out into the corridor above
no get back get back get back get back
korob that door won last
get back the door is pushed in and he is crushed underneath it kirk runs to his aid
go go he dies and kirk picks up his wand
quickly captain
korob seemed to think this was important said something about transmuter he throws the wand up to spock
captain bit more alacrity if you please kirk uses bed frame as trampoline to help him reach the hole and spock pulls him the rest of the way
captain mccoy arrives to take swing at them with morning-star kirk fights with him as spock takes on scott kirk knocks mccoy out
doc then sulu arrives spock neck-pinches scott kirk parries sulu martial arts attack until he can throw him against door when he is knocked out
jim mccoy has awakened only to get knocked out again
well at least we found them
fortuitous captain and now that we have them all together the cat arrives most unpleasant situation captain if only your phaser had some power
maybe we do he gets the wand sylvia have the transmuter it mine now
you re very clever captain more so than imagined clever resourceful and handsome
don let her touch the wand captain she strokes her pendant and she and kirk vanish
jim
don you get tired of these games
ve never played games give it to me
wasn sure before but am now this is the source of your power isn it the transmuter
no not the source it merely an amplifier the mind is the source mine is simple but yours has the key but you don know how to use it
catch on quickly
it is not too late captain james kirk come with me ll teach you you ll teach me
why because your people have nothing of your own is that why you need us
we need your dreams your ambition with them can build give me the transmuter
no
you fool don you know what you re giving up everything that your species finds desirable look at me am woman am all women
don know what you are but you re not woman you ve tortured my men and taken their minds from them you ask for love and return pain instead
holding phaser korob was wrong didn destroy all your weapons give me the transmuter give it to me kirk smashes the wand against the table and there is blinding blue light kirk is standing on the rocks holding phaser spock approaches wearing his tricorder mccoy scott and sulu follow him
what happened jim
that ll take some explaining bones
everything vanished
not everything by his feet are two tiny blue fluffy creatures with stick-thin arms and legs and squid tentacles for faces
korob and sylvia as they really are their forms were an illusion just like the castle and everything else only the power pack gave them reality
fascinating life form totally alien to our galaxy if we could preserve and study this but the little puppets collapse and die smoke rises from the bodies
too late all of this just an illusion
no illusion jackson is dead kirk to enterprise come in
five to beam up enterprise shuttlecraft ncc1701/7 is being piloted by kirk assisted by spock mccoy is tending to lady in green dress and headscarf
we have reached projected point three captain adjust to new course two oh one mark one five
thank you mister spock
offering drink jim
how is she doc
no change
small thanks to the starfleet
now really commissioner you can blame the starfleet
should ve received the proper inoculations ahead of time
sakuro disease is extremely rare the chances of anyone contracting it are literally billions to one
was sent to epsilon canaris three to prevent war doctor thanks to the inefficiency of the medical branch of the starfleet ve been forced to leave before my job was done
commissioner can assure you that once we reach the enterprise with its medical facilities we ll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war
how soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours captain
in exactly four hours twenty one minutes commissioner
captain
yes
will you check your automatic scanner please
that odd ve never seen anything like that before
nor have they lower the central shutter to view the approaching swirly flashing thing
heading directly toward us at warp speed
staying right with us sensor readings mister spock
vaguely like cloud of ionised hydrogen but with strong erratic electrical impulses sounds of electrical shorts the lights flicker
we ve got it
helm does not answer captain
neither do the pods communications are dead building overload cut all power relays
cut captain
what happening demand to know
you already know as much as we do miss hedford whatever that thing is outside it yanked us off course from the enterprise
now on course nine eight mark one two heading directly toward gamma canaris region
jim we ve got to get miss hedford to the enterprise her condition
know bones but there nothing can do about it
insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the enterprise
miss hedford we ll do what we can when we can at the moment we re helpless you might as well sit back and enjoy the ride the shuttlecraft has landed on blue and purple planet it is surrounded by lots of very high cliffs
enterprise this is the galileo come in please come in enterprise this is the galileo come in please it no good we re not transmitting bones
oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere some krypton argon neon temperature seventy five degrees fahrenheit practically identical to earth atmosphere
spock
gravity is similar to earth most unusual in view of its size the bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel more than an asteroid like small planetoid should say possibly remnant of planet breakup totally suitable for human life
all right we get out and get up issue phasers bones maintain full alert commissioner you ll stay inside
just how long am supposed to stay inside captain
that very good question wish could answer it all right let go
take look around bones spock checks the shuttlecraft for damage
most unusual unlikely in fact captain would say quite impossible
nothing wrong and nothing works
precisely
there must be reason
obviously
let look little further nancy comes out of the shuttlecraft
jim just took tricording sweep and got the same readings almost as spock got when we were pulled off course
the ionised cloud
think so only it reads here on the surface with us it in that direction and it doesn read solid it more unstable tenuous like collection of gases figure in an orange jumpsuit waves and runs towards them
fascinating
bones get physiological reading on that whatever it is
hello are you real mean not imagining you am
we re real enough
you speak english earth people
from the federation
the well it doesn matter cochrane ve been marooned here who knows how long if you only knew how good it is to see you and woman beautiful one at that
captain james kirk commanding the starship enterprise they shake hands this is my first officer mister spock
you re vulcan aren you
correct
chief surgeon leonard mccoy
doctor
pleasure
oh and excuse me assistant federation commissioner hedford
ma am you re food to starving man all of you hey that nice ship simple and clean been trying to get her to go again well forget it it won work
he human jim everything checks out perfectly
mister cochrane we were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn identify
which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment
well wouldn know anything about that
you say we ll be unable to get the ship to function again
not chance there some sort of dampening field down here power systems don work take my word for it
you don mind if we continue to try
go right ahead you ve got plenty of time
what about you cochrane how did you get here
marooned told you look we ll have lots of time to learn about each other have small place over that way all the comforts of home can even offer you hot bath
how perceptive of you to notice needed one
if you don mind mister cochrane like more than just statement that you were marooned here it long way off the beaten path
that right that why so glad to see you look ll tell you everything you want to know but not here your ship is sure beauty
yes she is and you ve been out of circulation quite while the principles may be new to you mister spock why don you explain our methods of propulsion to mister cochrane spock and cochrane go to the other side of the shuttlecraft
talks lot but he doesn say much
ve noticed something else
what that
he looks familiar
familiar now that you mention it he does
can quite place him but what about miss hedford
no temperature yet but we ve got to get under way soon jim guarantee you it will develop what are we going to do
take cochrane up on his offer not true vertical in the building and palms in the garden it looks quite nice and avant-garde
you built this mister cochrane
yes had tools and supplies left over from my crash
not bad
not earth but it livable grow vegetables in the fields over that next ridge come on in
all the comforts of home indeed mister cochrane where you get the antiques
you mean my instruments imagine things have changed lot since crashed
not that much hands piece over to spock to examine
must you keep it so terribly hot in here
the temperature constant seventy two degrees let me get you something cool to drink
do you feel hot
feel infuriated deeply put upon and absolutely outraged
it was quite hike here you re tired just take it easy for while
ll rest later doctor
temperature captain first sign
yes know it means we re running out of time
captain doctor from the doorway the three see swirly thing which then disappears cochrane comes in with tray of drinks
what was that
well sometimes the light plays tricks on you you be surprised what ve imagined ve seen around here sometimes
we imagined nothing mister cochrane there was an entity out there and suspect it was the same entity which brought us here please explain
there nothing to explain he hands drink to nancy
thank you
you ll find have very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned we find you out here where no human has any business being we were virtually hijacked in space and brought here now not just requesting an explanation mister demanding one
all right it was the companion
the what
that what call it as matter of fact captain didn crash here was brought here in my disabled ship was almost dead the companion saved my life
you were injured
was dying mister spock
you seem perfectly all right now what was the matter
was an old man
you were what
well don know how it did it but the companion rejuvenated me made me young again like am now
prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story sir meanwhile would you please explain exactly what this companion of yours is
told you don know what it is it exists it lives and can communicate with it
that pretty far out story
mister cochrane do you have first name
zefram
zefram cochrane of alpha centuri the discoverer of the space warp
that right captain
but that impossible zefram cochrane died hundred and fifty years ago
the name of zefram cochrane is revered throughout the known galaxy planets were named after him great universities cities
isn your story little improbable mister cochrane
no it true was eighty seven years old when came here
you say this companion found you and rejuvenated you what were you doing in space at the age of eighty seven
was tired captain was going to die and wanted to die in space that all
true his body was never found
you re looking at it mister spock
if so you wear your age very well
how do you feel
terrible how should feel
you re running little temperature perhaps you should lie down
doctor will you please just leave me alone it the heat
all right try to relax jim it started the fever it over hundred and it climbing
how long do we have
matter of hours that all
mister cochrane you say you were brought here hundred and fifty years ago you don look over thirty five
haven aged the companion sees to that
captain these instruments they date from the time indicated from your ship mister cochrane
cannibalised it the food water gardens everything else need the companion gives me apparently it creates it out of the native elements
you say you can communicate with it perhaps you can find out what we re doing here
already know
you wouldn mind telling us
you won like it
already don like it
you re here to keep me company
you mean you brought us here
no the companion did told it die of loneliness thought it would release me instead it brought you here
no no no that disgusting we re not animals no oh no it inhuman no no kirk and mccoy take her to bed and lie her down mccoy gives her an injection
spock run additional tricorder readings learn anything you can find me weapon to use against this thing
you ask me to find weapon do you intend to destroy it
intend to do whatever necessary to get us off this planet and commissioner hedford to the hospital if the companion stands in the way then we push it out of the way clear spock
quite clear captain
very well you have your orders spock leaves mister cochrane if you left here what would happen to you
begin to age again normally
do you want to leave here
believe me captain immortality consists largely of boredom what it like out there in the galaxy
we re on thousand planets and spreading out we cross fantastic distances and everything alive cochrane life everywhere we estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life we haven begun to map them interesting
how would you like to sleep for hundred and fifty years and wake up in new world
it all out there waiting for you but we ll need your help to get away
you ve got it spock is working when the companion appears next to him he reaches to touch it and then is flung away the electrics in the shuttlecraft all burn out
you seem to think this companion of yours can do almost anything
said it was very powerful
could it cure her
don know
how do you communicate with it
it on non-verbal level but usually get my message across
we ve got to try we re helpless see if it can do something
how do you do it
just sort of clear my mind and it comes he walks to the edge of the garden then stands with his eyes closed the companion appears then moves to envelope him
bones what do you make of that
almost symbiosis of some kind sort of joining
exactly what think not exactly like pet owner speaking to beloved animal would you say
no it more than that
agreed more like love the companion vanishes so kirk and mccoy go over to cochrane
are you all right
yes it kind of drains me little but all right
well
the companion can do anything to help miss hedford
then she ll die
if there anything could do to help would and will but we can expect nothing from the companion
spock are you all right
yes quite all right doctor most fascinating thing happened apparently the companion imparted to me rather quaint old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage
it attacked you
evidently unquestionably large part of its substance is simple electricity
oh yes not scientist or physicist mister spock but am correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can be shorted out
quite correct doctor spock is demonstrating the device he has put on the table
put this in the proximity of the companion throw this switch and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce it cannot fail
it troubles you cochrane
the companion saved my life it taken care of me all these years we ve been very close in way that hard to explain suppose even have an affection for it
it also keeping you prisoner
don want it killed
we may simply render it powerless
but you don know you could kill it won stand for that
we re getting out of here cochrane face up to it ll do anything have to to save all of our lives
suppose from your point of view you re right
we understand how you feel mister cochrane but it has to be done
all right you want me to contact it
please outside
what was it they used to call it the judas goat leaves
there is some risk captain we do not know the extent of its powers
nor it ours cochrane calls and the companion comes just as before when it has enveloped him kirk gives the word
now the jolt knocks cochrane out and the companion comes towards the dwelling apparently angry it enters blows up spock contraption then attacks kirk and spock they are rolling around on the floor inside the sparkly thing clutching their throats
stop it you re killing them stop it please stop it you re choking them let them go you re choking them stop it outside cochrane hears mccoy shouts and somehow calms the companion it vanishes
you all right jim
yeah
spock
all right they go to the doorway and see the companion with cochrane again
cochrane got it off of us but don know whether he did us favour or not
what kind of talk is that
how do you fight thing like that ve got ship up there somewhere responsibility for four lives here one of them dying because of me
it isn your fault
in command bones it makes it my fault how do you fight thing like that
maybe you re soldier so often that you forget you re also trained to be diplomat why not try carrot instead of stick
spock
yes captain
the universal translator on the shuttlecraft we can try that talk to that thing
the translator is for use with more congruent life forms
adjust it change it the trouble with immortality is it boring adjusting the translator will give you something to do
it is possible if could widen its pattern of reception
right down your alley spock get it here and get to work that thing is still out there better go that way spock leaves passing nancy bed
any change
yes for the worse ship log stardate 3219 lieutenant commander scott recording in the absence of captain kirk shuttlecraft bearing the captain the first officer chief surgeon mccoy and assistant federation commissioner hedford is now definitely overdue for rendezvous with the enterprise we are attempting to backtrack it
mister scott computer central reports that we re coming up on the co-ordinates of the last established position of the shuttlecraft
thank you lieutenant
steady no mister scott bearing three ten mark thirty five just cleared no antimatter residue
all scanners spherical sweep range maximum they ll have to pick it up
if the shuttlecraft powered away mister scott but if it were just towed
there still be traces of residual matter floating around lieutenant
bearing two ten mark forty strong particle concentration we re on it mister scott
lay on that course maintain scanning
course laid in sir particle density decreasing gone sir no readings
steady as she goes mister sulu
what do you think it means mister scott
the shuttlecraft was on schedule until it was shy five hours of rendezvous then something happened
well feel lot better if it were little more definite
it didn wreck there was no debris there no trace of expelled internal atmosphere no residual radioactivity ah it something took over tractor beams maybe something they dragged it away on the heading we re now on
if there are no further traces how are we going to follow them
we stay on this course see what comes up
it big galaxy mister scott
aye spock is working on the universal translator it is basically metal tube nearly foot long that can be held in the hand
what the theory behind this device
there are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life this device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns selects those ideas and concepts it recognises and then provides the necessary grammar
then it translates its findings into english
you mean it speaks
with voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end not one hundred percent efficient but nothing ever is ready mister spock
quite ready captain
mister cochrane call the companion cochrane summons the companion
companion it leaves cochrane we wish to talk to you
how can we communicate my thoughts you are hearing them this is interesting
feminine no doubt about it
yes the matter of gender could change the entire situation
way ahead of you
then it is not zookeeper
no lover companion it is wrong to keep us here against our will
man needs the company of his own kind or he will cease to exist he felt it to me
one of us will cease to exist if we don get her to place where we can care for her
the man needs others of his species that is why you are here the man must continue
companion try to understand it is the nature of our species to be free just as it is your nature to stay here we will cease to exist in captivity
your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration there will be nothing to harm you you will continue and the man will continue this is necessary
this is marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge ask it about its nature its history
this isn classroom trying to get us out of here
chance like this may never come again it could tell us so much
this isn the time companion what you offer us is not continuation it is non=existence we will cease to exist even the man will cease to exist
your impulses are illogical this communication is useless the man must continue therefore you will continue it is necessary she vanishes and they all head back indoors
captain why did you build that translator with feminine voice
we didn
but heard
the idea of male and female are universal constants cochrane there no doubt about it the companion is female
don understand
you don blind man could see it with cane you re not pet you re not specimen kept in cage you re lover
what
her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us her appearance is soft gentle her voice is melodic pleasing do not totally understand the emotion but it obviously exists the companion loves you
do you know what you re saying for all these years ve let something as alien as that crawl around inside me into my mind my feelings
what are you complaining about it kept you alive
that thing fed on me it used me it disgusting
there nothing disgusting about it it just another life form that all you get used to those things
you re as bad as it is
your highly emotional reaction is most illogical your relationship with the companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying eminently practical and totally harmless it may indeed have been quite beneficial
is this what the future holds men who have no notion of decency or morality maybe hundred and fifty years out of style but not going to be fodder for any inhuman monster leaves
fascinating totally parochial attitude
doctor doctor
right here miss hedford
heard him he was loved and he resents it
you just rest
no don want to die ve been good at my job but ve never been loved never what kind of life is that not to be loved never to have shown love and he runs away from love cries ship log stardate 3220 lieutenant commander scott reporting in lieu of the captain and the first officer we are continuing our search for the missing shuttlecraft
approaching what seems to be an asteroid belt sir scanners report approximately seven thousand bodies of sizes running from types to
atmosphere count
approximately thirty four percent of the bodies of atmospherian types to
all right then we ll do it the hard way all sensors set for life form registration automatic selection
mister scott there are thousands of them out there they could be on if they re on any of them at all
that right lieutenant thousands and we ll look them over one by one another contact session is in progress
companion do you love the man
do not understand
is he important to you more important than anything is he as though he were part of you
he is part of me the man must continue
he will not continue he will cease to exist by your feeling for him you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable he will cease to exist
he does not age he remains forever
you speak of his body speak of his spirit companion inside the shelter female of our species is dying she will not continue that is what will happen to the man unless you release all of us
do not understand
our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome you take away all obstacles without them to strengthen us we will weaken and die you regard the man only as toy you amuse yourself with him
you are wrong the man is the centre of all things care for him
but you can really love him you haven the slightest knowledge of love the total union of two people you are the companion he is the man you are two different things you can join you can love you may keep him here forever but you will always be separate apart from him
if were human there can be love vanishes
what did you hope to gain by that jim
try to convince her of the hopelessness of it love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice thought maybe if she loved him she let him go
but she or it is inhuman captain you cannot expect her to react like human
tried
it useless know
standing in the doorway zefram cochrane
bones
don understand it she not sick at all
we understand
it her
what
don you understand it the companion
bones
she perfectly healthy heart like hammer respiration normal blood pressure normal this is medically impossible
we are here
we
both of us those you knew as the commissioner and the companion we are both here
companion you do not have the power to create life
that is for the maker of all things
commissioner hedford was dying
that part of us was too weak to hold on in moment there would have been no continuing now we re together
then you are both here in the one body
we are one she goes to cochrane who takes step back
zefram we frighten you we ve never frightened you before loneliness this is loneliness oh what bitter thing oh zefram it so sad how do you bear it this loneliness
spock check out the shuttlecraft engine communications everything
that will not be necessary captain your vehicle will operate as before so will the communications device
you re letting us go
we could do nothing now to stop you you said we would not know love because we were not human now we are human we ll know the change of days we will know death but to touch the hand of man nothing is as important
you re very beautiful
part of me understands part does not but it pleases me
could explain many things
oh let me walk zefram let me feel the earth against my feet let me feel the warmth of the sun on my face you beside me let me feel these things
go ahead cochrane we have few things to do cochrane and nancy walk off hand in hand
mister scott it the captain
put him on lock on to his co-ordinates captain this is scotty are you all right
perfectly all right can you get fix on us
the helm is computing your position now captain
course two twenty four mark twelve eta fifty seven minutes
we ll be there in 57 minutes sir
very good ll continue transmitting assume standard orbit when you arrive we ll transport up in the shuttlecraft
what happened captain
interesting story scotty can tell you now because quite frankly don know how it going to end kirk out somewhere in the vicinity nancy is holding up her scarf to mimic how she saw cochrane when she was swirly thing
everything will be an eye-opener to you there thousand planets out there thousand races and ll show everything to you soon as learn my way around again maybe can make up little for everything you ve done for me
can go with you zefram
of course you can you have to
my life emanates from this place if should leave it for more than tiny march of days ll cease to exist must return even as you must consume matter to maintain your life
you gave up everything to be human but even if you stay here you ll eventually die
the joy of this hour am pleased
well can just fly away and leave you here
you must be free zefram cochrane
you saved my life took care of me you loved me never understood do now he kisses her
we re locked in captain standard orbit established shuttlecraft bay standing by to receive you
stand by scotty cochrane and nancy return
the enterprise is waiting mister cochrane
can take her away from here if do she ll die if leave her she ll die of loneliness owe everything to her can leave her love her is that surprising
not coming from human being you are after all essentially irrational
think it over mister cochrane there whole galaxy out there waiting to honour you
have honours enough
but you will age both of you there will be no immortality you ll both grow old here and finally die
that been happening to men and women for long time ve got the feeling it one of the pleasanter things about being human as long as you grow old together
are you sure
there plenty of water here the climate good for growing things might try to plant fig tree man entitled to that isn he it isn gratitude captain now that see her touch her know that love her we ll have lot of years together they ll be happy ones
all the best they shake hands and kirk walks away
captain don tell them about me
not word mister cochrane
jim what about that war on epsilon canaris three
well sure the federation can find another woman somewhere who ll stop that war
deep space station k7 now within sensor range captain
good mister chekov this flight is supposed to provide both experience and knowledge how close will we come to the klingon outpost if we continue on our present course
one parsec sir close enough to smell them
that is illogical ensign odours cannot travel through the vacuum of space
was making little joke sir
extremely little ensign
mister spock immediate past history of the quadrant
under dispute between the two parties since initial contact the battle of donatu five was fought near here twenty three solar years ago inconclusive
analysis of disputed area
undeveloped sherman planet is claimed by both sides our federation and the klingon empire we do have the better claim
the area was first mapped by the famous russian astronomer ivan borkoff almost two hundred
john burke
burke sir don think so sure it was
john burke was the chief astronomer at the royal academy in old britain at the time
oh royal academy well
is the rest of your history that faulty ensign key points of dispute
under terms of the organian peace treaty one side or the other must prove it can develop the planet most efficiently
and unfortunately though the klingons are brutal and aggressive they are most efficient
remember once peter the great had that problem like that the
kirk here channel it from space station k7
go to warp factor six
code one emergency that disaster call captain log stardate 4523 deep space station k7 has issued priority one call more than an emergency it signals near or total disaster we can only assume the klingons have attacked the station we re going in armed for battle ]bridge]
main phasers armed and ready sir the space station is on the main viewer looking intact
but there nothing there just the station
priority one distress call and it just absolutely peaceful lieutenant uhura break subspace silence
aye sir the channel open sir
space station k7 this is captain kirk of the enterprise what is your emergency the distress call
mister lurry you issued priority one distress call state the nature of your emergency
you ll try to explain you better be prepared to do more than that kirk out mister spock ll need your help mister chekov maintain battle readiness lieutenant uhura see that the transporter room is standing by
aye sir transporter room stand by kirk and spock arrive in the two man transporter alcove
mister lurry if there no emergency why did you issue priority one distress call
that was my order captain
captain kirk this is nilz baris he out from earth to take charge of the development project on sherman planet
and that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on defence alert
mister baris is the federation undersecretary in charge of agricultural affairs in this quadrant spock; that gives him the authority
oh
this is my assistant arne darvin
and this is my first officer mister spock
mister spock
and now captain want all available security guards want them posted around the storage compartments
storage compartments storage compartments
the storage compartments containing the quadrotriticale
what what what quadrotriticale lurry hands him small packet wheat so what
quadrotriticale is not wheat captain of course wouldn expect you or mister spock to know about such things but quadrotriticale is rather
quadrotriticale is high-yield grain four-lobed hybrid of wheat and rye perennial also believe its root grain triticale can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century canada
mister spock you ve made your point
quadrotriticale is the only earth grain that grows on sherman planet we have several tons of it here on the station it very important that grain gets to sherman planet safely mister baris thinks that klingon agents may try to sabotage it
you issued priority one distress call for couple of tons of wheat
quadrotriticale
of course captain realise that
mister baris you summoned the enterprise without an emergency you ll take full responsibility for it
what do you mean
misuse of the priority one channels is federation offence
did not misuse the priority one channel want that grain protected
captain couldn you at least post couple of guards we do have large number of ships passing through
it would seem logical precaution captain the sherman planet affair is of extreme importance to the federation
kirk to enterprise
secure from general quarters and beam down two and only two security guards have them report to mister lurry authorise shore leave for all off-duty personnel
kirk out
captain kirk how dare you authorise mere two men for project of this importance starfleet command
have never questioned the orders or the intelligence of any representative of the federation until now storms out of the office wherever humanoids may travel someone will set up bar to have pretty females serve intoxicating beverages k7 is no exception
summoning starship on priority a-1 channel to guard some storage compartments storage compartments of wheat
nevertheless captain the klingons would not enjoy seeing us successfully develop sherman planet
guess not downs his drink in one and heads for the door where they meet chekov and uhura coming in
see you didn waste time taking your shore leave
coldly how often do get shore leave
she wants to shop and thought would help her
entering oh excuse me excuse me
shows chekov the packet of wheat mister chekov what do you make of this
oh quadrotriticale ve read about this but ve never seen any before
does everybody know about this wheat but me
not everyone captain it russian invention
ah kirk and spock leave
don want any told you before and telling you again don want any more spican flame gems thanks to you have enough spican flame gems to last me lifetime
how sad for you my friend you won find finer stone anywhere but have something better surely you want some antarian glow water
use that to polish the flame gems
you re difficult man to reach but have something from the far reaches of the galaxy surely you want from yet another pocket the trader pulls what looks like ball of fluff
not at your price
what is it is it alive may hold it jones puts it in her hand and it starts purring
oh it adorable what is it
what is it why lovely lady it tribble
tribble
only the sweetest creature known to man excepting of course your lovely self
oh it purring listen it purring
it only saying that it likes you
are you selling them
that what we re trying to decide right now
my friend 10 credits apiece is very reasonable price now you can see for yourself how much the lovely little lady appreciates the finer things
one credit apiece
he won bite will he
sir transporting harmful animals from one planet to another is against regulations or weren you aware of that besides tribbles have no teeth
all right ll double my offer credits
twice nothing is still nothing
if you re not going to take him going to take him think he cute
four credits
is that an offer or joke
that my offer
that joke
five
you re an honest man ll tell you what going to do going to lessen my price to eight and half credits
you re talking yourself out of deal friend six credits not credit more
seven and half seven all right you robber six credits
done when can have them
right away
all right what are you selling them for
well let me see little lady six credits figure reasonable mark-up for reasonable profit say ten percent mark-up ten credits
thief
in fact ll sell you this one the tribble is eating grain spilt from the packet kirk gave chekov
hey he eating my grain
that ll be ten credits
that happens to be my sample and ll do with it as please and please to give it to the lovely lady
oh couldn could
insist
what are you trying to do ruin the market
once this lovely little lady starts to show this precious little darling around you won be able to keep up with them
yes what is it fitzpatrick speaking
put it on visual lieutenant
kirk here importance to the federation of sherman planet the key to our winning of this planet is the grain quadrotriticale the shipment of it must be protected effective immediately you will render any aid and assistance which undersecretary baris may require the safety of the grain and the project is your responsibility starfleet out
now that just lovely
but not totally unexpected
yes lieutenant what is it closing on the station
go to red alert notify mister lurry we ll be right up
what is the position of the klingon ship
hundred kilometres off k7 it just sitting there
captain have mister lurry
put him on visual
aye sir
mister lurry there klingon warship hanging one hundred kilometres off your station attack us
why not klingon ship is sitting right here in my office
cancel red alert we ll beam right down
security cancel red alert captain log stardate 4524 klingon warship is hovering only hundred kilometres from deep space station k7 while its captain waits in the station manager office their intentions are unknown false smiles all round as kirk and spock are greeted by klingon who very closely resembles the squire of gothos
ah my dear captain kirk
my dear captain koloth
let me assure you that my intentions are peaceful as ve already told mister lurry the purpose of my presence is to invoke shore leave rights
shore leave
captain we klingons are not as luxury-minded as you earthers we do not equip our ships with how shall say it non-essentials makes an hour-glass gesture with his hands
we have been in space for five months what we choose as recreation is our own business
might also add that under terms of the organian peace treaty you cannot refuse us
yes well don make those decisions mister lurry is in charge of those matters
captain may speak to you minute takes him aside look don want them here but don have the authority to refuse
well have the authority to act and going to use it my dear captain koloth you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave but only twelve at time and assure you for every man you bring down here shall have one security guard there will be no trouble
captain kirk there been no formal declaration of hostilities between our two respective governments so naturally our relationship will be peaceful one
let us both take steps to keep it that way
of course scott is at monitor reading when spock and kirk enter
another technical journal scotty
aye
don you ever relax
am relaxing there is crowd at long table and there are purring sounds
how long have you had that thing lieutenant
since yesterday doctor this morning found out that he mean she had had babies
well in that case you got bargain
you running nursery lieutenant
oh captain well hadn intended to sir but the tribble had other plans
did you get this at the space station
yes sir
stroking tribble most curious creature captain its trilling seems to have tranquillising effect on the human nervous system fortunately of course am immune to its effect everyone stares he suddenly realises what he is doing and puts it down spock and kirk leave
lieutenant do you mind if take one of these down to the lab to see what makes it tick
well all right doctor but if you re going to dissect it don want to know about it
won harm hair on its head wherever that is
say lieutenant seeing as you re giving them away can have one
sure why not think they re old enough to all go ahead
kirk here
pipe it down here will you mister chekov
yes mister baris what can do for you
kirk this station is swarming with klingons
was not aware mister baris that twelve klingons constitutes swarm
captain kirk there are klingon soldiers on this station now want you to keep that grain safe
mister baris have guards around the grain have guards around the klingons the only reason those guards are there is because starfleet wants them there as for what you want pauses at look from spock it has been noted and logged kirk out
captain may ask where you ll be
sickbay with headache there are eleven fluffy tribbles of various sizes and colour in large container
hi jim
bones what have you got for headache
let me guess klingons baris
both how many of these did uhura give you
just one
but you ve got er eleven
you noticed that huh here this ought to take care of it
how do they how do they
haven figured that out yet but can tell you this much almost fifty percent of the creature metabolism is geared for reproduction do you know what you get if you feed tribble too much
fat tribble
no you get bunch of hungry little tribbles
well bones all can suggest is you open up maternity ward
all you men going on shore leave to stay in groups avoid trouble with the klingons
ll tell them before they go sir
aren you going on shore leave scotty
why no sir
want you to go on shore leave make sure that everybody stays out of trouble
but captain aye sir
scotty enjoy yourself business is good scott chekov and freeman take the last vacant table two security men leave and jones enters whistling
ah friend can offer you charming little tribble
uh no thanks
oh perhaps one of you other gents no reply
ah friend klingon can interest you in harmless tribble the tribble screeches
get it away from me
sorry can understand it ve never seen them act this way before
get out of here with that parasite
he only harmless little
take it away
yes ah my good friend how would you like to enter another little transaction this time tribble for spot
tribble
indeed
starts producing tribbles from all over the place and putting them on the bar tribble the pretty lady in yellow brings our group their drinks
when are you going to get off that milk diet lad
this is vodka
where come from that soda pop this is drink for man
scotch
aye
it was invented by little old lady from leningrad korax goes over to the bar and shares his drink with jones
the earthers like those fuzzy things don they
oh yes
frankly never liked earthers they remind me of regulan blood worms
that cossack
easy lad you ought to be more forgiving
no just remembered there is one earthman who doesn remind me of regulan blood worm that kirk regulan blood worm is soft and shapeless but kirk isn soft kirk may be swaggering overbearing tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood but he not soft chekov leaps to his feet
take it easy lad everybody entitled to an opinion
that right and if think that kirk is denebian slime devil well that my opinion too
don do it mister and that an order
you heard what he called the captain
forget it it not worth fighting for we re big enough to take few insults now drink your drink swaps chekov vodka for freeman red wine
of course say that captain kirk deserves his ship we like the enterprise we we really do that sagging old rust bucket is designed like garbage scow half the quadrant knows it that why they re learning to speak klingonese
mister scott
laddie don you think you should rephrase that
you re right should didn mean to say that the enterprise should be hauling garbage meant to say that it should be hauled away as garbage there fight of course scott first right cross sends korax flying over table after that it the klingons versus starfleet with the barman beating retreat and jones taking the opportunity to help himself to drinks from the dispensing machine finally he decides to leave with his spoils and is about to enjoy his last glass when the security guards rush in followed by the barman who takes the glass just before it reaches jones lips so he takes another out of his pocket instead captain log stardate 4525 small disturbance between the klingon crew and members of the enterprise crew has broken out aboard space station k7 am forced to cancel shore leave for both ships ten men are lined up chekov has nice bruise on his cheek
want to know who started it waiting freeman who started the fight
don know sir
all right chekov know you you started it didn you
no sir didn
who did
don know sir
don know sir want to know who threw the first punch all right you re all confined to quarters until find out who started it dismissed the men file out scotty not you you were supposed to prevent trouble mister scott
aye captain
who threw the first punch scotty
um
mister scott
did captain
you did mister scott what caused it scotty
they insulted us sir
must have been some insult
aye it was
you threw the first punch
aye chekov wanted to but held him back
you held why did chekov want to start fight
well the klingon sir is this off the record
no this is not off the record
well captain the klingons called you uh tin-plated overbearing swaggering dictator with delusions of godhood
is that all
no sir they also compared you with denebian slime devil
see
and then they said you
get the picture scotty
yes sir
after they said all this that when you hit the klingons
no sir
no
no didn you told us to avoid trouble
oh yes
and didn see that it was worth fighting about after all we re big enough to take few insults aren we
what was it they said that started the fight
they called the enterprise garbage scow sir
see and that when you hit the klingons
yes sir
you hit the klingons because they insulted the enterprise not because they
well sir this was matter of pride
all right scotty dismissed scotty you re restricted to quarters until further notice
big grin yes sir thank you sir that ll give me chance to catch up on my technical journals there are lot more than eleven tribbles now
what the matter spock
there something disquieting about these creatures
don tell me you ve got feeling
don be insulting doctor they remind me of the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin but they seem to eat great deal see no practical use for them
does everything have to have practical use for you they re nice soft and furry and they make pleasant sound
so would an ermine violin but see no advantage in having one
it human characteristic to love little animals especially if they re attractive in some way
doctor am well aware of human characteristics am frequently inundated by them but ve trained myself to put up with practically anything
spock don know too much about these little tribbles yet but there one thing that have discovered
what is that doctor
like them better than like you
doctor
yes
they do have one redeeming characteristic
what that
they do not talk too much if you ll excuse me sir kirk walks to his chair preoccupied by his last conversation when he sits there is squeak he has sat on large tribble then he notices that there are fluffy balls everywhere
doctor mccoy would you mind coming up to the bridge he takes walk around then lieutenant uhura how did all these tribbles get on the bridge
don know sir they do seem to be all over the ship mccoy enters stroking tribble
doctor mccoy
yes did you want to see me jim don look at me it the tribbles who are breeding if we don get them off this ship we re going to be hip deep in them
explain that
the nearest thing can figure out is they re born pregnant which seems to be quite time saver
know but really
and from my observations it seems they re bisexual reproducing at will and brother have they got lot of will
captain am forced to agree with the doctor ve been running computations on their rate of reproduction the figures are taking an alarming direction they re consuming our supplies and returning nothing
but they do give us something mister spock they give us love well cyrano jones says tribble is the only love that money can buy
too much of anything lieutenant even love isn necessarily good thing
yes captain
get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship and then contact mister lurry and tell him beaming down
aye aye
have him find cyrano jones and hold him
aye
and get these tribbles off the bridge
aye aye captain
captain kirk mystified at your tone of voice ve done nothing to warrant such severe treatment
oh really
surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors
of course what did you say
by removing the tribbles from their natural habitat you have so to speak removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape
if by that you mean do they breed quickly of course that how maintain my stock breeding animals is not against regulations only breeding dangerous ones and tribbles are not dangerous
just incredibly prolific
precisely and at six credits head well that is body it mounts up now if you ll excuse me
you should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing
if did what would happen to man search for knowledge well must be tending my ship au revoir he meets baris and darvin at the door
go ahead sir tell him
captain kirk consider your security measures disgrace in my opinion you have taken this important project far too lightly
on the contrary sir think of this project as very important it is you take lightly
am going to report fully to the proper authorities that you have given free and complete access to this station to man who is quite probably klingon agent
that serious charge to whom are you referring
to that man who just walked out of here
cyrano jones klingon agent
you heard me
heard you
he simply could not believe his ears
what evidence do you have against mister jones
my assistant here has kept mister jones under close surveillance for quite some time and his actions have been most suspicious believe he was involved in that little altercation between your men and the men from
yes yes go on what else do you have
well captain ve checked his ship log and it seems that he was within the klingon sphere of influence less than four months ago
the man is an independent scout captain it is quite possible he is also klingon spy
we have already checked on the background of mister cyrano jones he is licensed asteroid locator and prospector he never broken the law at least not severely for the past seven years with his one-man spaceship he obtained marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise including unfortunately tribbles
but he is after my grain
do you have any proof of that
you can deny he disrupted this station
people have disrupted stations before without being klingon agents sometimes all they need is title mister baris unfortunately disrupting space station is not an offence now if you ll excuse me have ship to tend to au revoir there are tribbles on the walls the floor the tables even as chess pieces kirk gets tray from the food dispenser it has tribbles on it
my chicken sandwich and coffee this is my chicken sandwich and coffee
fascinating
want these off the ship don care if it takes every man we ve got want them off the ship scott enters carrying an armful of fluff
they re into the machinery all right and they re probably in all the other food processors too
how
probably through one of the air vents
captain there are vents of that type on the space station
and in the storage compartments goes to table monitor this is kirk contact manager lurry and nilz baris have them meet us near the storage compartments we re beaming down come on spock the tribbles are all over the pads too kirk picks one up but there nowhere else to put it
energise
what wrong
plenty if what think happened has happened
is that door secure
yes sir nothing could get in
good open it
it not working sir it seems to be stuck
here let me try it but he can open it either so he tried one of the overhead doors instead that does open and whole load of tribbles fall out burying the gallant captain up to his shoulders spock examines one
they seem to be gorged
gorged on my grain kirk am going to hold you responsible there must be thousands of them
hundreds of thousands
one million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred sixty one that assuming one tribble multiplying with an average litter of ten producing new generation every twelve hours over period of three days
that assuming they got here three days ago
and allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment
kirk you should have known you are responsible for turning the development project into total disaster
mister baris
and through being intimidated kirk you have insulted me you have ignored me you ve walked all over me you have abused your authority and you ve rejected my requests and this this is the result going to hold you responsible
mister baris ll hold you in irons if you don shut up
jim think ve got it all we have to do is quit feeding them we quit feeding them they stop breeding
now he tells me
captain this tribble is dead and so are these
lot of them are dead lot of them are alive but they won be for long
the logical assumption is that there is something in the grain
yes bones want the tribbles the grain everything analysed want to know what killed these tribbles
haven figured out what keeps them alive yet all right if find out anything ll let you know leaves
that isn going to do you any good kirk this project is ruined and starfleet is going to hear about it and when they do they will have board of inquiry and they will roast you alive and am going to be there kirk to enjoy every minute of it
until that inquiry still the captain and as captain want two things done first find cyrano jones and second as another tribble hits him on the head close that door security guard is picking up tribbles
really captain kirk must protest this treatment
ah mister jones with an armful few questions
captain kirk
what do you want
an official apology addressed to the klingon high command expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of klingon nationals in this quadrant
an apology
yes you ve harassed my men you ve treated them like criminals you ve been most uncourteous captain kirk if you wish to avoid diplomatic incident
no kirk you can let him that will give them the wedge they need to claim sherman planet
believe that more than the word of an aggrieved klingon commander would be necessary for that mister baris
mister spock as far as sherman planet is concerned captain kirk has already given it to us
well we ll see about that but before take any official action like to know just what happened who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale what was in the grain that killed them
captain kirk before you go on may make request
yes
can you get those things out of here the guards take jones tribbles from him they get to the door as darvin enters and the tribbles shriek
remarkable
hold on minute thought you said tribbles liked everybody
they do can understand it the last time saw one act this way was at the bar
what was in the bar
klingons him for one points at korax kirk takes two tribbles from the guards and brings them near korax they shriek
you re right mister jones they don like klingons mccoy enters but they do like vulcans didn know you had it in you
obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures captain
obviously mister baris they like you well there no accounting for taste and back to darvin they don like you mister darvin wonder why bones
scanning him heartbeat is all wrong his body temperature is jim this man is klingon
klingon
wonder what starfleet command will say about that what about the grain bones
oh yes it was poisoned
poisoned
yes it been impregnated with virus the virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream the more the organism eats the more inert matter is built up so after two or three days they reached point where they couldn take in enough nourishment to survive
they starved to death in storage compartment full of grain they starved to death
that is essentially it
mister darvin are you going to talk
have nothing to say kirk thrusts the tribbles into his face all right poisoned the grain take them away
and the tribbles had nothing to do with it
don know never saw one before in my life and hope never see one of those fuzzy miserable things again
certain that can be arranged darvin guards if you ll excuse me captain baris leaves with the security guards and darvin
captain koloth about that apology
yes
you have six hours to get your ship out of federation territory the tribbles shriek koloth makes hasty bow and practically runs out of the room with korax
you know think could learn to like tribbles the face of an unhappy barman peers out from pile of tribbles
well captain suppose free to go now
no you re not there something want to show you you know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life
captain one little tribble isn harmful captain you wouldn do thing like that to me now would you would you
the penalty is twenty years in rehabilitation colony
captain kirk friend friend kirk surely we can come to some sort of mutual understanding after all my tribbles did put you wise to the poisoned grain and they did help you to find the klingon agent you saved lot of lives that way
there is one thing you can do
yes
pick up every tribble on the space station if you do that ll speak to mister lurry about returning your spaceship
it would take years
seventeen point nine to be exact
seventeen point nine years
consider it job security
captain you re hard man all right all right
you ll do it
he ll do it
ll do it he starts stuffing tribbles into his many pockets
captain starfleet was able to divert that freighter
good that means sherman planet will get its quadrotriticale only few weeks late don see any tribbles around here
and you won find tribble on this entire ship
bones how did you do it
cannot take credit for another man work scotty did it
scotty where are the tribbles
oh er captain it was really mister spock recommendation
of course spock
based on computer analysis of course taking into account the possibilities of
gentlemen don want to interrupt this mutual admiration society but like to know where the tribbles are
tell him spock
well it was mister scott who performed the actual engineering
mister scott where are the tribbles
used the transporter captain
you used the transporter
aye
where did you transport them scott you didn transport them into space did you
captain kirk that be inhuman
where are they
gave them good home sir
shouting where
gave them to the klingons sir
whisper you gave them to the klingons
aye sir before they went into warp transported the whole kit and caboodle into their engine room where they ll be no tribble at all kirk spock chekov yeoman landon and two guards have beamed down to study new world
start your readings mccoy and two more guards beam down
well just might stake out claim and settle down here jim
it is spectacular isn it
it shame to have to intrude
well the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted we do what we re told
the soil here is remarkably rich and fertile captain husbandry would be quite efficacious
are you sure about that
oh quite sure readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this curious even at the poles there very little variation in temperature which maintains planet-wide average of seventy six degrees
know almost impossible
it makes me homesick just like russia
more like the garden of eden ensign
of course doctor the garden of eden was just outside moscow very nice place it must have made adam and eve very sad to leave
just outside moscow all right there village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two we ll head that way planet turns to face the away team and guard walks up to it
captain the plant fires its stamens into his chest and he falls
dead
what did somebody say that paradise must ve looked like this captain log stardate 3715 while making routine exploration of the unexplored gamma trianguli six one of my men has been killed by poisonous plant
as soon as we get out of the way beam the body up
aye captain it shame about hendorff
what is it
we re losing potency in our antimatter pods don think it serious but we re looking into it
what causing it electromagnetic field of the planet and they are wee bit abnormal that might have something to do with it
but you say there nothing to worry about
well sir didn exactly say that
well stay on top of it we ve got job to down here we might as well finish it
hear it nice down there
yeah it nice if we re little more careful we shouldn run into any more trouble
could do with nice walk in garden with green leaves and grass
we ll do the walking scotty you get on the antimatter pod if it gets worse let me know we ll beam up kirk out
find that most unusual captain
scotty will handle it we ve got job to do turn up anything on your tricorder
indeed subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions
that strange
quite strong fairly regular artificially produced
mallory
yes captain
we re heading for the village avoid contact with the humanoids want you and marple to make full reconnaissance and be careful there may be other dangers besides poisonous plants keep in constant communication
aye aye sir
captain
what is it
there humanoid hiding directly behind us moving with remarkable agility bearing one eight kirk nods to guard and they go to flank their observer
what is it mister spock
visitor one wanting to retain his anonymity should say
all this beauty and now mister hendorff dead somebody watching us it frightening
if you insist on worrying worry about me ve been wanting to get you in place like this for long time
mister chekov yeoman landon know you find each other fascinating but we re not here to conduct field experiment in human biology
was about to take some readings
anything
whatever it is it moves like cat
jim don like this
neither do all hands we ve been watched we ll probably be watched we re moving out formation they set off in single file guard in the lead and chekov bringing up the rear along the way spock notices very flat rock and picks it up
interesting extremely low specific gravity some uraninite hornblende quartz breaks it in half fragile good cleavage an analysis should prove interesting he throws one half away and it explodes when it hits the ground
would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks mister spock
obviously highly unstable captain this could be find of some importance in large quantities it could be considerable source of power
garden of eden with land mines spock puts the other piece of rock down very carefully and they continue their route march an occasional bush rustle indicates they are being watched
enterprise to captain kirk
kirk here
couldn stop it but know why
why
something from the surface it like pail of water on fire beam maybe or transmission and it still on having it analysed but it like nothing ve seen before village we located down there
we re heading there now scotty you need any help
there nothing you can do about it sir danger
all right scotty we ll try and find out what going on down here kirk out
if scott is correct about the force from the surface it may have to do with the vibrations read earlier
some kind of generator
if so an immense one probably subterranean mccoy is scanning something
what that
some of the thorns like those that killed hendorff see the stuff on the end it like saplin only it thousand times stronger
peculiar stuff to find in paradise
noticing plant moving jim he pushes the captain and mccoy out of the way but takes the thorns in his own chest
spock spock security alert is he alive mccoy injects spock
filled him with enough masiform to make the whole crew turn handsprings and he not responding got to get him back to the ship jim
kirk to enterprise
we re beaming up notify transporter room and make arrangements to pick up mallory and marple they re scouting ahead of us
aye aye sir transporter room stand by to beam up landing party
all hands
standing by sir
energise
energise three times the landing party start to dematerialise and each time they fail to vanish
scotty energise scotty what the matter
we can make transporter contact sir the entire system inhibited the way it is now we couldn beam up fly captain log supplementary our investigation of gamma trianguli six has suddenly turned into nightmare we re being watched and followed mister spock has been injured and now we find we are unable to return to the ship
scotty is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble you re having with the antimatter pods
don know sir ll check it and get back with you scott out spock starts to sit up
spock are you all right
doctor mccoy potion is acting like all his potions turning my stomach other than that am quite well
if your blood were red instead of green you wouldn have an upset stomach
just what do you think you were trying to do
surmised you were unaware of that plant so
stepped in front and took the thorns yourself
assure you captain had no intention of doing that it was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way
see well next time just yell can step out of the way as quickly as the next man
shall do so
trying to get yourself killed do you know how much starfleet has invested in you
one hundred twenty two thousand two hundred
never mind but thanks kaplan take the post
yes sir
not only is something after us but it after the ship as well
captain to affect the ship at this extreme range would require highly sophisticated planetary defence system it goes dark
thirty seconds ago there wasn cloud in the sky lightning strike hits kaplan and he is burnt to ash instantly
come on they take cover and the storm passes as quickly as it came they find the smoldering remains of kaplan
phasers beautiful day mister spock not cloud in the sky just like paradise the scouting party has reached collection of round huts very african
kirk here
mallory here captain near the village co-ordinates one one eight by two two zero but kirk only hears static and faint voice
mallory mallory you all right come in
the village is primitive strictly tribal from the looks of it and captain there something else captain come in
mallory mallory you all right mallory
captain those co-ordinates are short distance in that direction
on the double they run off sort of meanwhile mallory is running for his life
it over there that way never saw anything like he steps on one of those exploding rocks
mallory marple stand back watch it the rocks kneeling by the body kaplan hendorff know kaplan family now mallory
jim you couldn have stopped any of this
his father helped me get into the academy
captain in each case this was unavoidable
could ve prevented all of it
don see how
walk in paradise among the green grass and flowers we should ve beamed up at the first sign of trouble
you are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture
also have the option to disregard those orders if consider them overly hazardous this isn that important mission spock not worth the lives of three of my men drop my guard for minute because like the smell of growing things and now three men are dead and the ship in trouble
no one has ever stated that starfleet duty was particularly safe you ve followed the correct and logical course done everything commander could do self-recriminations he pauses captain our friend is back
marple chekov at attention gentlemen something or someone is behind that rock want it marple cut around the rock to your right make loud noise be careful marple leaves spock you and chekov create diversion and make it loud
mister chekov your tricorder readings are totally inefficient
mind your own business sir for your information have very high efficiency rating
ensign will not have you address me in that tone of voice
what do you want violence kirk catches their observer and hits him as he tries to run away to his astonishment the white-haired male begins to cry
won hurt you do you understand won hurt you
you struck me with your hand
well won strike you again you ve been following us watching us why
am the eyes of vaal he must see
who is vaal
vaal is vaal he is everything
do you have name
am akuta am the leader of the feeders of vaal spock and the others arrive
they re not going to hurt you promise you akuta akuta we come in peace we would like to speak to this vaal
akuta alone speaks to vaal am the eyes and the voice of vaal it is vaal wish
captain this is fascinating if you will permit me sir akuta has metal wires sticking out behind from behind his ears
antennae
they are my ears for vaal they were given to me in the dim time so the people could understand his commands and obey
you speak of the people of vaal are they nearby
we are close to vaal so we may serve him shall take you there
enterprise to captain kirk
kirk here
condition red condition red captain something has grabbed us from the planet surface break loose
it no use mister scott we re just barely holding our own
scotty are the warp drives still out
aye sir all we have is impulse power
put it on maximum full emergency circuits
they re all on captain
kyle
no sir we re slipping
computer banks kyle feed in rate get me figure we might be able to pull out with warp drive but without it worse
we re starting to lose ground hurry up on that figure kyle
maintain full reverse thrust against the pull put team on that warp drive get it working
ve done that captain they haven been able to do thing kyle hands him padd it no good captain with maximum thrust against the pull power for sixteen hours then we burn up for sure
scotty you re my chief engineer you know everything about that ship there is to know more than the men who designed it if you can get those warp engines working
ll do everything there is to do sir scott out
tell me about vaal
all the world knows about vaal he causes the rains to fall and the sun to shine all good comes from vaal
take me to him wish to speak to him
shall take you to him but he will not speak to you he speaks only to me
ll take my chances akuta leads them to giant rock serpent head with green and yellow eyes sticking out of cliff it looks like there is fire in it throat
vaal captain log stardate 3715 we have been introduced to vaal evidently the source of the planet power emanations and possibly the force that threatens both us and our ship
fascinating very high order of workmanship very ancient generating great power
but this is not the centre mister spock
no captain the centre is deep in the earth beneath us this is an access point it would also seem to be he steps forward and is flung back
force field
obviously
you all right
yes quite it extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions conventional in composition and quite formidable
akuta how do you talk to vaal
vaal calls me only then
well we can get to it we can talk to it unless it wants to talk to us
vaal sleeps now when he is hungry you may be able to speak with him if he desires it
when does he get hungry
soon come we will give you food and drink if you are tired you may rest
these are the people of vaal everyone is grown up with white hair and wearing simple cotton sarong
where are the others
there are no others
the children
children you use unknown words to me
little ones like yourselves they grow
replacements none are necessary they are forbidden by vaal
but when man and woman fall in love
love strange words children love what is love
love is when two people are chekov demonstrates by putting his arm around her waist
ah yes the holding the touching vaal has forbidden this
well there goes paradise
these people are from another place they have come among us welcome them
welcome to vaal
placing the equivalent of lei around kirk wrist our homes are open to you
well thank you it does something for you
yes indeed it does captain it makes me uncomfortable
am sayana you have name
yes spock am spock
amid general merriment spock
fail to see what they find so amusing
come
this house is your house will send you more food and drink you are welcome in the place of vaal
now we re welcome while ago this whole planet was trying to kill us it doesn make sense
nothing makes sense down here kirk to enterprise
status report scotty
no change captain the orbit is decaying along computed lines no success with the warp drive we re going down and we can stop it
sick of hearing that word can get that ship out of there
sir we re doing everything within engineering reason
then use your imagination tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to and crack out of there with the main section but get that ship out of there
sir going to switch over everything but the life-support systems and boost the impulse power but that just about as dangerous
do it kirk out
incredible
report
just ran thorough check on the natives and there complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems no decalcification no degeneration of tissue no arteriosclerosis in simple terms jim they re not growing old and can begin to tell you how old they are twenty years or twenty thousand years
see opinion
quite possible it checks with my atmospheric analysis their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun
add to that simple diet perfectly controlled temperature no natural enemies apparently no vices no replacements needed maybe it is paradise after all gong sounds outside and all the villagers are heading off towards vaal
mister spock the villagers are walking into the serpent mouth and depositing plates of fruit down it throat kirk and spock watch from behind shrub
apparently our hypothesis is correct there is no living being there it is machine nothing more
well the field down people are going in let see what kind of luck we have but as soon as they stand the eyes light up and there is rumble of thunder
that not the way
evidently not this is no ordinary machine captain it may well possess rudimentary intelligence
but it needs to eat frequently so it can have any great power reserves
that may not be of any help the enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free
what happens if vaal weakens around feeding time spock check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship have them measure it hour by hour
acknowledged mccoy joins them
what going on jim
mess call
in my view splendid example of reciprocity
it would take computerised vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of statement
doctor you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures remind you that humans are only tiny minority in this galaxy
there are certain absolutes mister spock and one of them is the right of humanoids to free and unchained environment the right to have conditions which permit growth
another is their right to choose system which seems to work for them
jim you re not just going to stand by and be blinded to what going on here these are humanoids intelligent they need to advance and grow don you understand what my readings indicate there been no progress here in at least ten thousand years this isn life it stagnation
doctor these people are healthy and they are happy what ever you choose to call it this system works despite your emotional reaction to it
it might work for you mister spock but it doesn work for me humanoids living so they can service hunk of tin
gentlemen think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship out of danger kirk here
scotty sir we have reading on the power source mister spock requested when we first monitored it was generating alternating cycles totalling one hundred to the twentieth power waltham units
did it maintain scotty
no sir power dropping bit by bit nominal but definite drain
good keep monitoring how are you coming along with the circuit switchover
we re putting everything but the kitchen sink into impulse power sir it will take us another eight hours to complete the work
that cutting it bit fine scotty
aye but if we don break out rather we didn have to wait too long for the end of it
kirk out
every time think of the enterprise burning up and us
yeoman you re wasting energy
captain we re trapped
sit down and have something to eat
the enterprise is up there
that hasn happened yet wonder what would happen yeoman speculate what would happen if someone on this planet died
but they can you said that vaal takes care of them
accidents happen
yes suppose if someone were to fall off cliff or something that might upset the balance of the population then they would need replacement
they need replacement opinion mister spock
see no alternative
but these people mean if they don know anything about what mean is they don seem to have any natural er mean how is it done
mister spock you re the science officer why don you explain it to the young lady
well believe it safe cough safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions
from machine that like to see
understand vaal it shall be done chekov and landon are taking romantic stroll together
you know if it weren for vaal this place would be paradise they are watched by local couple
any place we can be together is paradise
pav can the ship really break away
don know
will we be able to get back aboard
martha don know but if we do have to stay here would it be so very bad
no not if you re with me they kiss
why do you look like that
the way they touched do not understand
they were not angry think it was pleasant for them
but what is to be gained it is not dance it gathers no food it does not serve vaal but it did seem as though it was pleasant to them he kisses the girl cheek
it is pleasant makora
yes they touched in this way they kiss properly and there is roll of thunder
vaal he is angry
the law is plain have given you the words of vaal do you beg the lightning to strike
we saw the strangers the two of them do this thing
you copied them
we meant no harm
vaal speaks truly to me the newcomers are danger tell the men of vaal to meet me in the clear place when the strangers are asleep it is vaal own words the men are waiting for akuta he arrives with
vaal has spoken to me his words are true hear them we are to kill the strangers
kill akuta we do not understand
it is thing to do like like feeding vaal vaal explained it to me will show you this the melon is the head of one of the strangers find heavy stick come up from behind the stranger and do this he swings his stick and smashes the melon to pieces
it is simple thing it is the word of vaal it will be done to all of them when the sun returns in the morning but he looks worried
am concerned captain this may not be an ideal society but it is viable one
bones was right these people aren living they re existing they don create they don produce they don even think they exist to service machine
if we do what it seems we must in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive
these are people not robots they should have the opportunity of choice we owe it to them to interfere
starfleet command may think otherwise
ll take my chances why don you have look around kirk to enterprise mister scott spock leaves
how it going scotty
almost ready sir we need half an hour yet
you realise that within forty five minutes the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere
know that as you said that cutting things fine
yes
captain
kirk out what is it
disturbing the people of vaal seem to have disappeared
force field captain
vaal we are on peaceful mission we mean no harm to you or your people the sky darkens
variation in impulses captain believe it is reading us strong jump on all wavelengths lightning threatens
let get out of here but spock is hit with nice hole in the back of his tunic
bones
second degree burns not serious but ll bet they smart
doctor you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement
marple the red-shirt is struck by akuta the other men are easily eluded disarmed and dealt with
put them in the hut find out where the women are put them in there too
the good doctor was concerned that the vaalians achieved true human stature submit there is no cause for worry they ve taken the first step they ve learned to kill
we re ready here sir all available power has been channelled into the impulse engines we have twelve minutes before entering atmosphere
all right scotty put her in full reverse get her out of there
full reverse mister kyle all engines
sir
captain we re doing it we re pulling away
scotty what happened
it no good sir there only few systems responding gained maybe an hour but we blew almost every system in the ship doing it
there nothing left to try again guess you ll have to fire me sir
you re fired four hundred people
jim
they ll die because couldn see warning sign had to follow orders always orders the gong sounds and the people of vaal try to leave the hut
get back in there
fine time to ring the dinner bell
get back in there now
bones that it stay with chekov keep those people from feeding vaal don let them feed vaal keep them in the hut mister spock they head off through the shrubs
scotty do you still have phaser power
aye but what located down here kirk; on my command commence firing on those co-ordinates
aye sir but they won penetrate that force field
if my guess is correct they won have to stand by
vaal calls to us let us go to him he hungers please
readings are getting weaker captain wide variation in energy transmissions as though vaal were trying to draw on other sources
tapping its energy cells
would assume so
good the ship pulling away must have weakened it considerable it has to be fed but its reserve capacity could hold out for days
if it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off phaser attack it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves
my plan exactly scotty
scott here sir
scotty commence firing and maintain
mister kyle all phasers commence firing two red beams hit the edge of the force field and start turning it green
tremendous upsurge in generated power captain obviously vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field
good let see how long he can do it the green glow arrives at the snake head as the storm clouds gather the lightning flashes and small explosions go off inside vaal smoke comes out of its mouth finally the eyes stop glowing and the throat goes dark
scotty cease fire the sun breaks through the clouds again
no power generation at all captain vaal is dead
mister scott status report
tractor beam gone potency returning to antimatter pods working on the circuits immediately transporter ll be ready in an hour
scotty you re re-hired as soon as the transporter fixed form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down kirk out chekov bones let those people go
but it was vaal who put the fruit on the trees caused the rain to fall vaal cared for us
you ll learn to care for yourselves with our help and there no trick to putting fruit on trees you might enjoy it you ll learn to build for yourselves think for yourselves work for yourselves and what you create is yours that what we call freedom you ll like it lot and you ll learn something about men and women the way they re supposed to be caring for each other being happy with each other being good to each other that what we call love you ll like that too lot you and your children
what are children
the little ones look like you just go on the way you re going you ll find out
don agree with you at all mister spock
that not unusual doctor
jim want you to hear this
captain not at all certain we did the correct thing on gamma trianguli six
we put those people back on normal course of social evolution see nothing wrong in that
well that good object lesson mister spock it an example of what can happen when machine becomes too efficient does too much work for you
captain you are aware of the biblical story of genesis
yes of course aware of it adam and eve tasted the apple and as result were driven out of paradise
precisely captain and in manner of speaking we have given the people of vaal the apple the knowledge of good and evil if you will as result of which they too have been driven out of paradise
doctor do understand him correctly are you casting me in the role of satan
not at all captain
is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like satan mccoy and kirk walk around spock mccoy is gazing intently at his ears
am not aware of anyone who fits that description captain
no mister spock didn think you would be captain log using the lightspeed breakaway factor the enterprise has moved back through time to the twentieth century we are now in extended orbit around earth using our ship deflector shields to remain unobserved our mission historical research we are monitoring earth communications to find out how our planet survived desperate problems in the year 1968 the ship rocks as if being hit by something
alert status force shields on maximum leslie begin sensor scan
it appears we have accidentally intercepted someone transporter beam captain
it impossible the twentieth century had no such
captain something is beaming aboard this vessel
ll be right there
the beam is originating at least one thousand light years away
no transporter beam can reach that far not even in our century kirk enters
something is shaking us apart
it locked it locked our circuits wide open one of the transporter pads has activated
you re right something is beaming aboard it man in dark suit holding black cat he steps down from the platform and speaks calmly
why have you intercepted me
security
transporter room on the double
please identify yourselves
this is the united spaceship enterprise captain kirk commanding
to the cat yes heard him isis we re aboard space vessel from what planet
earth
that impossible in this time period there weren notices spock humans with vulcan you re from the future captain you re going to have to beam me down to earth immediately security arrive
phasers on stun
careful isis all right captain kirk my name is gary seven am human being from the twentieth century was on my way
humans of the twentieth century do not go beaming around the galaxy mister seven
ve been living on another planet far more advanced was beaming to earth when you intercepted me
the location of that planet
they wish their existence kept secret even in your time it will remain unknown
it impossible to hide whole planet
impossible for you not for them captain kirk am of this time period you are not you interfere with me with what have to do there and you ll change history you ll destroy the earth and probably yourselves too
if what he says is true captain every second we delay him could be dangerous
and if he lying
this is the most critical period in earth history the planet from wants to help earth survive
what if it turns out you re an invading alien from the future
most difficult decision captain
can beam you down without further proof one way or the other security confinement
this way please
sickbay seven attacks the security men spock neck-pinches him but is thrown off kirk gets phaser and stuns seven as he starts to work the transporter controls
jim what going on down there
bones check the prisoner you ll find in security confinement want medical analysis fast is he or isn he human captain log supplemental man in twentieth century business suit what is he not even spock vulcan neck pinch could stop him without our phasers he would have over powered all five of us find it difficult to believe the mysterious mister seven can be human and yet suppose he is spock is stroking the cat who is purring
what do you make of the cat mister spock
quite lovely animal captain find myself strangely drawn to it
this is the captain all science engineering and supervisory personnel lock into the briefing room our next decision can be of enormous consequence not only to us but to earth entire future you ve already been given as much information as we have please break in at any time with analysis of that information navigation report our star maps show no habitable planets in that area of the galaxy
he did say his planet was hidden captain
engineering powerful it fused most of our recording circuits could have brought him back through great distances could have brought him back through time there no way for us to know
mister spock historical report
current earth crises would fill tape bank captain there will be an important assassination today an equally dangerous government coup in asia and this could be highly critical the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the united states countering similar launch by other powers
weren orbital nuclear devices one of this era greatest problems
most definitely once the sky was full of orbiting h-bombs the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident setting off nuclear holocaust
mccoy here with your analysis
acknowledged seven tests the forcefield blocking the doorway then behind the guard back he takes pen from his pocket and turns it into device that shuts the forcefield off he also uses it to stop the guard from shooting him
you re tired go to sleep the guard slides down the wall with grin on his face as seven makes his escape
well must admit the sensor readings seem too good human readings yes but not single physical flaw totally perfect body
if an alien needed body
he might be inclined to prepare perfect one captain but then again he may be telling the truth
gentlemen need proof all you re telling me is that on the one hand he may be lying and on the other the cat exits the room escaped all decks alert
this is the captain inform us preparing to beam down
try to override shut it off the cat arrives as seven finishes setting the controls
know isis but we ll be gone before they get here they beam away just as kirk mccoy and spock dash into the room display case full of glasses splits in two revealing massive safe door behind it the locking wheel turns the safe door opens and gary seven carrying isis the cat walks out of fog into the main room the safe door shuts itself behind him and is hidden again behind the shelves of glasses seven goes to the window and looks down onto street filled with people and traffic
you re right isis it is primitive it incredible that people can exist like this at least we won have to not for long computer on bookcase swings open to reveal black screen circular monitor and control panel
high-pitched staccato female computer on
specify locations of agents two oh one and three four seven
identify self
simply check my voice pattern you ll find me listed as supervisor one nine four code name gary seven
voice pattern matches but have no listing of gary seven assigned this planet
computer am class one supervisor you are ordered to override previous instructions and answer my questions
am beta five computer capable of analytical decisions please confirm identity as supervisor by describing nature of agents and mission here
computer caution you have little love for beta five snobbery override all right agents are male and female descendants of human ancestors taken from earth approximately six thousand years ago they re the product of generations of training for this mission problem earth technology and science have progressed faster than political and social knowledge purpose of mission to prevent earth civilisation from destroying itself before it can mature into peaceful society
incomplete but sufficient location of agents unreported for three days
why didn you say so in the first place no don answer that simply begin search immediately recheck all news broadcasts decode any government intercepted message
am aware of proper search procedures one nine four there are no clouds at all over north and central africa the middle east and into the indian subcontinent as the enterprise orbits earth no green vegetation either
we can estimate only within thousand metres or so where he beamed down captain
if we beam down can you compare our position with his control setting
aye
following him down is major risk captain if we ourselves do anything that changes history
aware of that but must know if he lying and we can answer that sitting up here have ship stores prepare the proper costumes stand by to beam us down
in response to nuclear warhead placed in suborbit by other major power united states today launching suborbital platform with multi-warhead capacity purpose to maintain balance of power
that the same kind of nonsense that almost destroyed planet omicron four
analysis correct earth situation similar mission of agents two oh one and three four seven set malfunction on united states rocket
progress of mission has the rocket been set to malfunction
negative no progress
how much time before launch
exactly one hour twenty seven minutes twelve seconds
computer record the following unless agents are found immediately must undertake their mission kirk and spock have managed to beam down in suits and overcoats and woolly hat for spock of course
scotty lock in on our position
locked in proceed one nine five degrees true the computer is fabricating identity papers for seven as colonel with the cia lieutenant in the nypd and colonel with the nsa it has also produced map of mckinley rocket base then young woman in an orange and purple mini-dress lets herself into an adjoining room
hello anybody here looks like your lucky day roberta they can dock you if they don know you re late seven comes in from the main room
where have you been
oh the subway got stalled
where have you been for the past three days
now wait minute why should tell you who are you anyway
where three four seven
with three four eight
two oh one code responses are not necessary
listen friend maybe just better call the police right now
sit down
who do you think you are
said sit down
okay will
ll say one thing for you you play your role well but that is no longer necessary supervisor one nine four code name gary seven need complete report
report
yes report everything you have done for the past three earth days he gestures to the typewriter
oh everything ve done
everything you ve done
well okay puts sheet of paper in it well let see
not with your fingers he flicks switch on the side of the machine
well how do you expect me to type with my nose did you see that the machine typed everything it typing everything saying stop it stop it stop it he turns it off okay that does it quit
wait minute
quitting right now
you re not acting are you
acting leaving goodbye seven locks the door remotely with his pen hey hey seven activates green cube on the desk
tie in to computer
computer on
scan unidentified female present
roberta lincoln human profession secretary employed by three four seven and two oh one description age twenty five feet seven inches one hundred twenty pounds hair presently tinted honey blonde although behaviour appears erratic possesses high iq birthmarks
hey
small mole on left shoulder somewhat larger star-shaped mark on her
hey watch it okay ll bite what is it
miss lincoln miss lincoln what kind of work did your employers say they were doing here
research for new encyclopaedia no no
all right you can go of course if you do you won be helping your country unless you don care about that
sure care what do you think am
don know miss lincoln what you are not yet all know is that my incompetence has made you aware of very secret devices that are vital to the security of this nation
oh well what are you guys around here anyway fbi some kind of government agents huh the cat enters as he hands her one of his new ids cia very groovy
thank you isis ll be right in isis leaves it trained cat just like guard dogs that kind of thing
yeah
don let anybody in here ll be busy
okay outside the apartment building
scotty
correlated readings indicate greater altitude approximately thirty metres higher sir
out
occurrence automobile accident location highway nine four nine ten miles north of mckinley rocket base agents three four seven and two oh one were killed instantly
that just doesn make sense for them to die in something as useless as an automobile accident are the facts verified
verified descriptions of bodies are exact kirk and spock step out of the elevator by apartment 12a
go ahead scotty
proceed five metres two four seven degrees true they arrive outside 12b and kirk rings the doorbell
computer off roberta answers the door to the office as the computer hides behind the bookcase again kirk; where mister seven
don know what you re talking about listen you guys can come in here
where mister seven seven activates the safe-cum-transporter you re doing this is government office seven picks up isis and leaves
neither one of you can come in here
where mister seven
this is against the rules
in here captain at door to main room
what do you think you re doing you want me to picks up the telephone send the police eight eleven east sixty eighth street apartment twelve
give me the phone seven is setting the dial on the safe think you are let go there physical tussle going on between kirk and roberta
what do you think you re doing you big jerk what the big idea spock takes over from kirk in manhandling roberta
let go of me stop it don go in there what the big idea get your hands off of me mean it she pulls off his hat and sees his ears and eyebrows what are you kirk blasts open the connecting door as seven dematerialises and the safe shuts itself carrying isis seven walks out of assembly area b-10 hangar warning liquid hydrogen into the early morning sunshine or late afternoon the shadows are fairly long
attention stand by for launch area clearance it is now sixty minutes to launch minus sixty and counting and the big white us rocket stands gleaming on its launch gantry kirk finds the plans to the rocket base lying on the table
where mister seven
warning you ve already called the police
plans to mckinley rocket base
there it is charlie open up in there police roberta manages to shout before spock can get his hand over her mouth
open up in there it the police
wide scan scotty we ll be moving spock in here spock they go into the main room and roberta dashes to open the door to the police
in there
now scotty
what going on here kirk spock and the two policemen are beamed up kirk and spock dash off the transporter pad leaving the flat-foots standing slack-jawed
reverse and energise
charlie they are beamed back into the apartment watched by roberta
attention it is now fifty minutes to launch minus fifty and counting all systems clear all systems clear standing by for inspection of launch pad seven is standing next to launch director cromwell car
security guard you speak to you moment
yeah sure sarge hands over his nsa id there it is
ll have to confirm this colonel
all right
just put the cat down and keep your hands at your side
all right
into telephone give me security identification check
be careful lsis don get stepped on
yes security isis yowls distracting the guard seven whips out his pen and zaps the guard into immobility
into telephone security this is sergeant lipton and we re all straightened out down here right thank you very much goodbye all right sergeant now let just turn right around we re going to walk this way you just sit right down right right there and have little nap grinning inanely the guard sits on the ground by the building and
attention it is now forty five minutes to launch minus forty five and counting all systems clear all systems clear
standby for inspection of launch pad
heading for the gantry sound alert
attention first alert first alert begin clearing gantry area clear launch pad safety group clear launch pad all systems continue to green repeat all systems still green standing by for inspection of launch pad cromwell gets into his car outside launch control and drives away remember we last saw seven by this car
there an old-style weather satellite in orbit below us if could bounce off it could get some good views ve got it an image of the rocket is on the wall monitor
could get even closer if could spot him could lock on and beam him up
chances are he out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres
launch is in forty minutes stand by to beam us down continue visual scan
attention stand by for launch area clearance range safety verified launch director now en route to rocket gantry to confirm launch pad clear ground stations three four and eleven stand by for confirmation repeat standby for launch area clearance cromwell and couple of military men arrive in their cars at the base of the rocket
hi jack
mister cromwell
launch director at gantry beginning final check
attention it is now thirty five minutes to launch minus thirty five minutes and counting cromwell car boot opens and seven and isis get out
canary islands confirming they are go for the launch all ground stations confirm go the three officials return to their cars
lock the elevator at the top lieutenant time to get out of here
attention clear launch pad repeat clear launch pad and gantry the officials drive away seven and isis are in the elevator heading for the top of the rocket lipton the guard that seven put to sleep wakes up as kirk and spock beam in
freeze one move and you ve both had it security to launch director we have unidentified intruders males pair do you want to delay countdown roberta is talking to the green cube
all right don answer but you can tell him quit you can tell him promise not to tell anybody anything he safe and you re safe my little green friend the box flashes twice same to you she sits on the desk and accidentally knocks the desk pen that controls the safe door intrigued she investigates crowd is gathering few miles away to watch the launch
attention twenty minutes to launch minus twenty minutes and counting all systems continue green repeat all systems still green seven is lying along one of the girders supporting the rocket at control panel access isis is meowing instructions
yes thank you know how to open it with his ubiquitous pen know there not much time he starts fiddling with the wiring inside two communicators and two phasers are on the launch controllers console lipton boss is doing the interrogation
these are all they were carrying
minus fifteen minutes and counting
you ve got chance and ll offer it only this once the slightest possible charges will be brought against you if you identify yourselves and tell us why you re here
to delay countdown
no sign of trouble on my boards launch director confirm status all systems
control to launch director confirming status board indicates all is well space flight conditions measure out as planned
continue countdown
no countdown delay repeat no delay all systems are green and go all systems are go
minus fourteen and counting
meow you are nervous aren you doll all right going as fast as can
minus thirteen minutes and counting status board looks good stages look good all systems go status board says go scott is continuing his visual search for seven and finally spots him at the top of the rocket
security send two men up here right away
minus eight minutes and counting all systems go status board go roberta fiddling with the safe door finally makes it open
no
stand by going to beam him up on the gantry seven feels the transporter effect and sits up holding isis in the apartment roberta fiddles with knobs on the inside of the safe door and pulls him away from the enterprise
had him and something yanked him away seven gets up from the floor of the safe
what are you doing wasn finished
sorry just touched that button right there and then wow
you must have intercepted the enterprise trying to beam me on board computer on the bookcase opens up
lock into launch site scan
one minute to launch
oh my gosh captain log supplemental spock and in custody even if we talked they wouldn believe us we re powerless to stop mister seven or prevent the launch or even be certain if we should have never felt so helpless
thirty seconds to launch
look hey mean not even the cia could do all this
minus twenty seconds mark stages reporting ready for launch automatic sequences on she completely automatic now
fifteen seconds to launch ten seconds
nine eight seven six five four three two one ignition we have ignition nasa footage of the powerful rocket lifting off and being tracked by radio telescopes
altitude one thousand feet all good all as planned trajectory nominal
rocket passing twenty mile arc and accelerating
computer adjustments at the rocket base were not completed can still take over the rocket as planned
rocket control possible with exceiver circuits operated manually
exceiver on manual lock into flight telemetry visual off roberta backs away and picks up the telephone isis meows warning and seven uses his pen to sever the cord
roberta please don try to leave you ll find all the doors locked are you jealous isis it most unbecoming
rocket altitude now one hundred miles standing by to begin malfunction as planned
begin malfunction at third stage
exceiver setting now nine zero point zero eight
nine zero point zero eight
second stage ready to detach
visual on
second stage detaching the famous shot of rocket stage falling away back to earth
third stage igniting
begin malfunction take it off course
malfunction setting correct rocket veering from planned course
give me the readings fast
what is it
malfunction rocket is deviating from programmed flight path
safety standby to destruct continuing deviation from flight path repeat deviation confirmed and increasing telemetry control transmitter systems tie in all systems tie in report
arm the warhead
accomplished nuclear warhead now armed set exceiver nine one point two one eight roberta picks up cigar box
exceiver nine one point two one eight uhura is scanning broadcasts in different languages
sensor shows that the rocket has armed itself mister scott
computers indicate an impact somewhere in the heart of the euro-asian continent
we ve still time to enter close orbit and destroy it with our phaser sir
they re beginning to worry on earth mister scott major powers
ve got to risk calling the captain lieutenant uhura open channel
aye aye
warhead status confirmed she armed herself somehow repeat this bird is armed the warhead alive all boards report status stand by on destruct standby to transmit destruct signal
how could the warhead arm itself
we don know
you can destroy it of course
if we can we re going to lay an bomb on somebody somewhere ready on destruct signal destruct
transmit destruct signal transmit destruct signal kirk picks up communicator but lipton hears the chirp as he opens it
get back over there roberta hits seven over the head with the cigar box
look sorry but like you asked me do care about my country and you can be cia she takes his pen from his pocket
orbital platform separating
hold it
computer rocket status
hold it mister seven telling you you re through monkeying around with my country rocket
warhead still armed six minutes to impact
hold it don move you did enough already
you ve got to let me finish what started or in six minutes world war three begins
flight path continuing on target
destruct is fouled up somehow flight control she coming down fully armed she ll go off on impact
what try again boost the signal
boosting signal boosting signal flight control we have boosted destruct signal repeat destruct signal at maximum boost was beaming up mister seven and something yanked him away from me
hello hello come in
here let me help you sergeant it operated with this dial here neck pinches lipton and kirk gets to the communicator
we re getting no response
make absolutely certain check everything again
tracking stations report no response on destruct signal
scotty beam us directly to seven apartment
auxiliary transmitters check out flight control she hasn destructed herself repeat destruct is not working she still up there do you read descending and armed descending and armed she ll go off on impact bermuda ground station reports she still up there south africa ground station reports no response on boosted destruct signal
picks up the red telephone get me the president
rocket descending and accelerating do you have further instructions one nine four
roberta you ve got to believe me look truly advanced planet wouldn use force they wouldn come here in strange alien forms the best of all possible methods would be to take human beings to their world train them for generations until they re needed here
mister seven want to believe you do know this world needs help that why some of my generation are kind of crazy and rebels you know we wonder if we re going to be alive when we re thirty
two minutes to impact
hold it right there mister seven
oh no
spock you re the expert can you detonate the warhead from this computer
can try captain
altitude five hundred fifty miles
captain want that warhead detonated too unless do it at least hundred miles above ground just barely in time to frighten them out of this arms race alert retaliatory strike ordered on warhead impact
altitude four hundred and fifty miles
spock
can estimate some of this captain but without more time
captain he can only guess will you please let me do my job
don know what your job is you may set those controls so we can detonate that warhead
pointing the pen at kirk listen you get away from him
grabbing the pen from her roberta be careful the servo is set to kill he hands the pen to kirk
altitude four hundred miles
there are only seconds ll need time to set it
please he telling the truth
fifty five seconds to impact
spock if you can handle it going to have to trust him
it is difficult to know which is best captain
forty seconds to impact
without facts the decision cannot be made logically you must rely on your human intuition
altitude three hundred miles descending and accelerating
go
thirty seconds and accelerating
computer go to visual count by tens
one hundred ninety miles one hundred eighty miles one hundred seventy miles one hundred sixty miles one hundred fifty one hundred forty one hundred thirty one hundred twenty there bright flash detonation one hundred four miles big sighs of relief all round later gary seven is dictating his report to the special typewriter kirk and spock are back in uniform
and in spite of the accidental interference with history by the earth ship from the future the mission was completed
correction mister seven it appears we did not interfere the enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968 suddenly isis has transformed from black cat to dark haired woman in black outfit
our record tapes show although not generally revealed that on this date malfunctioning suborbital warhead was exploded exactly one hundred and four miles above the earth
so everything happened the way it was supposed to
and you ll be pleased our records show that it resulted in new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons
would you mind telling me who that is
that miss lincoln is simply my cat
your cat she cat again who decides to scratch behind her own ear
what else do your record tapes show
afraid we can reveal everything we know mister seven
captain we could say that mister seven and miss lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them
yes think we could say that two to beam up scotty
live long and prosper mister seven
and the same to you miss lincoln energise
the reading growing stronger captain coming from star system directly ahead
it not signal sir it does not seem to even exist and yet it affecting all my channels
well
someone or something is attempting to attract our attention
someone or something has succeeded our distress signal relays have been activated we ve been given direction to follow but how what causing it
do not know not even vulcan can know the unknown captain we are hundreds of light years past where any earth ship has ever explored
planet dead ahead captain becoming visual there yellow and gold planet on the viewscreen
class planet captain
close to earth conditions
with two very important exceptions it much older than earth and about half million years ago its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm the planet has evidently been dead since then sensors detect no life of any kind kirk kirk; are your hailing frequencies open
no sir touched your instruments and directed you here now with this closer distance can speak to you at last
who are you sargon
is that request or demand are unnecessary
the planet is dead there no possibility of life there as we understand life james kirk for if it does if you let what is left of me perish then all of you my children all of mankind must perish too captain log stardate 4768 the enterprise is in orbit above planet whose surface our sensors tell us is devoid of all life world destroyed and dead for at least half million years yet from it comes voice the energy of pure thought telling us something has survived here for those thousands of centuries
dictating log since exploration and contact with alien intelligences is our primary mission ve decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact log entry out how long before starfleet receives that
over three weeks at this distance sir
captain
got something
sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet
reading energy only captain no life forms please come to us rescue us from oblivion
coming from deep under the planet surface captain under at least one hundred miles of solid rock that deep beneath the surface have no fear
reading chamber now oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support
lieutenant uhura have doctor mccoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment
yes sir
spock
captain do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago
and would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this but it is full of unknowns and we can risk both of us being off the ship the lights go out
all power gone sir
on the other hand perhaps this sargon would like you to come with us power is restored
fascinating
all normal no damage at all
see will you transport down with us mister spock
evidently captain
mister sulu you have the conn
jim why no briefing on this at least like to know what we re getting into
easy bones as long as you know there something down there you know as much as we do the rest is only guesses
don like it sir the transporter co-ordinates preset by an alien of some sort you could materialise inside solid rock
inside solid rock
unlikely these co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber
have feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to
they or it
who are you
doctor ann mulhall astro-biology well was ordered to report here for landing party duty
by whom
strange not sure well not liar captain did receive an order to report here for duty
sure she did captain just as you received an order to bring me along
oh yes
let get back to this solid rock business just how much rock are we going to go through
approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles doctor
miles are you joking
no we re not let go
doctor if you prefer to stay behind
no no if be useful as long as you re going down might as well take medical look at whatever this is the landing party and two guards gather on the pads scotty stands sulking with arms crossed as the transporter activates and just sends the four officers somewhere
captain the security guards
kirk here
yes scotty and shouldn be able to this deep inside the planet but perhaps this has been arranged for us too is the security guard up there
they re fine they just didn dematerialise
no problem yet maintain alert kirk out
atmosphere report captain fraction richer in oxygen than usual for us but otherwise normal
this vault was constructed about half million years ago about the same time the planet surface was destroyed if our sensor readings are accurate
composition of walls
they re an alloy or substance completely unknown to me much stronger and harder than anything ve measured before
all readings are off the scale captain
the air seems fresh it must be re-circulated somehow
is that for us or does it need fresh air panel slides back to reveal much larger area with rock walls and glowing sphere elegantly poised on an angled support
the glowing sphere welcome am sargon
sargon would it harm you if
you may use your tricorder mister spock your readings will show energy but no substance sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind
pure energy matter without form
impossible
but you once had body of some type
body much as yours my children although our minds were infinitely greater
that twice you ve referred to us as my children
because it is possible you are our descendants captain kirk six thousand centuries ago our vessels were colonising this galaxy just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness as you now leave your own seed on distant planets so we left our seed behind us perhaps your own legends of an adam and an eve were two of our travellers
our beliefs and our studies indicate that life on our planet earth evolved independently
that would tend however to explain certain elements of vulcan prehistory
in either case do not know it was so long ago and the records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm which we loosened upon ourselves
war
struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that you could not comprehend
then perhaps your intelligence wasn so great sargon we faced similar crisis in our early nuclear age we found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves
and we survived our primitive nuclear era my son but there comes to all races an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face
don understand
one day our minds became so powerful we dared think of ourselves as gods
you said you wanted our help what is it you wish kirk staggers back slightly then there is high-pitched sound as his head is flung back
just moment doctor
am sargon
where our captain where jim kirk
he is unharmed have taken his body to demonstrate
drawing his phaser won go along with this back to where you were sargon or whatever you are
and if he refuses doctor what do you propose to do with your phaser that is still jim body kirk convulses briefly and the sphere has dimmed lot
lungs filled with air again to see again heart pumping arteries surging with blood again half million years to be again your captain has an excellent body doctor mccoy compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it
what are your plans for it can you exchange places again when you wish
have no fear your captain is quite unharmed although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as do
doctor
yes have the same readings
are you aware of what happening to his body heart action doubled temperature hundred and four degrees
he ll die if you don leave his body soon
what is it you want of us
in the next room there are other receptacles the other two of us that survived you doctor ann mulhall and you mister spock we require your bodies also we must have captain kirk and you so that we may live again there are group of boxes on the wall containing spheres only two are alight
even for us half million years is almost too long to wait two others still survive henoch and thalassa thalassa my thalassa am pleased you survived with me forgive me it has been so very long
when the struggle came which devastated your planet
only the best minds were chosen to survive thalassa my wife as you may have guessed henoch from the other side realising our mistake we attempted to perpetuate both sides we built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion
fascinating
we knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root that one day you would build vessels as we did and one day you would come here
these others they were stored differently than you but it was
and search the heavens with my mind probing waiting probing and then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here
so you could steal our bodies from us
to steal to take them from you no no my children you misunderstand we mean only that you should lend us your bodies for short time
and destroy them just as you re burning that one up now heartbeat two hundred and sixty two spock entire metabolic rate correspondingly high
will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached
our bodies sargon for what purpose
to build to build humanoid robots we must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands your fingers
then you intend to construct mechanical bodies move your minds into them and then return our bodies to us
we have engineers technicians why can they build your robots for you
no our methods our skills are far beyond your abilities it is time they help him back to sargon sphere kirk briefly convulses with pain then the sphere glows bright again and he falls to his knees
is it you jim nod good his metabolic rate is back to normal
captain do you know what happened do you remember any part of it
yes sargon borrowed my body was floating in time and space
he doesn appear to be harmed physically anyway
spock remember when sargon and exchanged as we passed each other for an instant we were one know him now know what he is and what he wants and don fear him
that the most ridiculous statement ve ever heard an alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into bottle and
afraid that must agree with doctor mccoy you could be suffering from form of false euphoria
sargon involved must agree to this after all these centuries we can wait few more hours
and what if we should decide against you
you re going to what are they all right in the head doctor
no comment
simple transference their minds and ours
quite simple happens every day
scotty need your approval too since you ll work with them furnishing them all they need to make the android robots you won be working with them you ll be working with us our bodies they ll be inside us and we ll be
it all seems rather indecent to me
not so certain of that doctor it is scientifically fascinating
once inside their mechanical bodies engineer they can leave this planet travel back with us with their knowledge mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years
bones they ll show us medical advances miracles you never dreamed possible scotty engineering advances vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts
ach you re joking
no he not
they re giants and we re insects beside them they could destroy us without meaning to and all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command too coincidence
they selected us as the most compatible bodies
what your attitude on that doctor
well if we all agree willing to host thalassa mind scientist the opportunity is an extraordinary one for experimentation observation
starship engine the size of walnut that impossible but don suppose there be any harm in looking over diagrams on it
bones you could stop all this by saying no that why called you all here together we ll all be deeply involved it must be unanimous
then ll still want one question answered to my satisfaction why not list of possible miracles but simple basic understandable why that overrides all danger and let not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this
they used to say if man could fly he have wings but he did fly he discovered he had to do you wish that the first apollo mission hadn reached the moon or that we hadn gone on to mars and then to the nearest star that like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to in command could order this but not because doctor mccoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this but must point out that the possibilities the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great risk risk is our business that what the starship is all about that why we re aboard her you may dissent without prejudice do hear negative vote silence around the table engineer stand by to beam aboard three receptacles the three volunteers are lying on beds with the spheres on tables beside them
the extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high and the body functions will race many times their normal metabolism so we re going to have to monitor this very carefully
yes sir
well guess we re as ready as we ll ever be jim
ready sargon the spheres emit brilliant light the patients twitch then the spheres dim
with echoy sargon voice the transference is complete
metabolic rate is double and rising doctor
with grin and echoy voice hello oh you are lovely female pleasant sight to wake up to after half million years
thank you
you re welcome
echoy forgotten what it felt like even to breathe again sargon
here in this body
am not displeased my husband your body is not unlike that which was your own
and too am pleased beloved
after so long so very long
kiss so they do
this is an excellent body doctor seem to have received the best of the three strength hearing eyesight all far above your human norms surprised the vulcans never conquered your race
vulcans worship peace above all henoch
yes of course just as we do doctor mulhall/thalassa collapses and they help her back onto the bed
nurse then kirk/sargon gets dizzy
doctor
henoch you better get back to bed too
it will be unnecessary doctor this vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism
sargon it won work you ve got to get out before you kill them
we will vacate at once until you can administer metabolic reduction injection
what
ll prepare the formula sargon
henoch your condition
can continue in this body for several hours
fortunate we will vacate at once and they are as good as their word
this woman will assist me to chapel you will take me to your pharmacology laboratory they leave
bones what
it was close jim you both barely got back alive unless the formula works we can risk it again
now this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal while the bodies are occupied you will administer one injection of ten cc each hour
understand
this hypo you will code mark for thalassa and this one you will code mark for me
yes sir
this one you will administer to captain kirk while sargon is in his body
this hypo does not contain the same formula
no that correct but since will arrange for you to administer each of the injections no one else will notice
without the same formula captain kirk will die he touches her forehead
what were you saying
was wanted to say something ve forgotten what it was
yes well you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos
yes that that was it will inform doctor mccoy that each is properly filled for each patient
very good you see sargon would not permit me to keep this body it is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that sargon will die with him enterprise medical log stardate 4769 three alien minds now inhabit the bodies of captain kirk science officer spock and doctor ann mulhall
as planned the construction of android robots is underway all is proceeding as expected and as promised can find no reason for concern but yet am filled with foreboding sargon and thalassa are working when their hands touch
sargon remember day long ago we sat beside silver lake the air was scented with the flowers of our planet
remember you held my hand like this he kisses it as spock comes in
think it best not to remember so well
in two days you ll have your own hands thalassa mechanically efficient and quite human-looking android robot hands of course hands without feeling enjoy the taste of life while you can
our minds will have survived and as androids we can move among the people who do live teaching them helping them not to make the errors we did
what is it sargon
nothing our next injection will renovate me do not be concerned chapel is holding the hypos and trying to remember something very important
nurse how are the last metabolic readings on our patients
you ll find them excellent doctor well within normal
is something wrong miss chapel
er yes er had something to say can seem to remember
regarding our patients
yes that must be it am so pleased the way they are responding doctor the formula working perfectly
you look tired miss chapel perhaps you care for me to administer the last few injections
tired well not at all doctor thank you for asking leaves puzzled mccoy mulhall/thalassa is looking at her reflection in metallic surface when scott comes in with small doo-dad
thank you have you prepared the negaton hydracoils for the drawing sargon supplied
for all the good it ll do you it fancy name but how will something that looks like drop of jelly make this thing work you ll need microgears and pulley that does what muscle does
that would be highly inefficient
tell you lady this thing won work
it will have twice the strength and agility of your body engineer and will last thousand years that is assuming you ll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it scott leaves as spock laughs
thousand-year prison thalassa and when it wears out we ll build another one and we ll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years and another and another sargon has closed his mind to better way with these bodies
they re not ours henoch
when you awoke in this body thalassa you said how good it was to breathe again to have eyes and to see again to feel to live and feel again thalassa just think how much we can do for mankind are these bodies too much to ask for in return would you prefer this
no beginning to hate it she rushes out and spock smirks
sickbay
sargon here mccoy in your deck six briefing room mulhall enters
sargon what is it
nothing of importance fatigue perhaps she sees what is on the monitor
henoch formula
yes wanted to be certain there was no error formula is correct don be concerned it is an excellent body there you see feel better already
in time host body will become accustomed to us husband injections will no longer be necessary
that will take months perhaps years we haven that choice thalassa
husband feel the touch of my hand husband
no beloved if we torment ourselves
beloved what will that word mean to machine
our thoughts will intertwine
will they husband will they intertwine like this can two minds press close like this can robot lips do this they kiss then kirk falls gently to the floor sargon what is it mccoy and chapel enter
hypo
doctor help him
he dead medical log stardate 4770 do list one death or two when kirk body died sargon was too far distant from his receptacle to transfer back sargon is dead but is captain kirk dead his body is but his consciousness is still in the receptacle into which it was transferred earlier the medical team hook kirk body up to life support machine
all his vital organs are now working doctor
yes we can keep them going for few weeks or month for all the good it ll do there is shiny plastic person on the table now
why pretend to work on that thing henoch you know you never intended to leave spock body
this is your new home thalassa once occupied ll add female features and some texturing you no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be woman he tests its hand movement it is ready thalassa
no
you have no excuse to keep the real body any longer sargon would ve required that you enter the mechanism immediately
cannot live in that thing
doctor
yes
would you like to save your captain kirk
but you said that was impossible
we have many powers sargon did not permit us to use he thought them too tempting to us this body pleases me intend to keep it
see and henoch intends to keep spock body of course
henoch plans are his own affair wish only to exist in peace as living woman
if you re asking my approval
require only your silence only you and will know that doctor mulhall has not returned to her body isn that worth your captain life doctor we can take what we wish neither you this ship nor worlds have the power to stop us
neither jim nor can trade body we don own it happens to belong to young woman
who you hardly know almost stranger to you
will not peddle flesh physician
physician in contrast to what we are you are prancing savage medicine man you dare defy one you should be on your knees worshipping could destroy you with single thought mccoy is suddenly writhing in pain as he is surrounded by flames
stop the flames are gone sargon was right the temptations within living body are too great forgive me truth yourself
sargon where are you thought you destroyed by henoch
have power even henoch does not suspect beloved
yes yes see understand just as we would have placed our consciousness within robots sargon has placed his into your vessel
doctor
doctor leave us sargon has plan we have much work to do mccoy leaves the room and the door shuts and locks behind him the ship shakes as he activates his desk monitor
this is sickbay get me the door opens and chapel walks out staring blankly ahead
nurse chapel what in the devil he goes back into the ward
jim are you all right
yes fine bones
thalassa
she is now with sargon doctor ann mulhall back in my own body then we see the three blackened and broken spheres
jim the receptacles spock consciousness was in one of them
it was necessary
what are you talking about there is no spock to return to his body you ve killed loyal officer your best friend
bones prepare hypo the fastest deadliest poison to vulcans spock consciousness is gone we must kill his body the thing in it uhura is screaming in terror before collapsing across her console chapel is standing rigid by the captain chair
must make an example of you too helm kirk mulhall and mccoy enter
pain captain and you my dear as kirk and mulhall double over mccoy dashes to spock side ready to inject him
fortunately doctor know every thought of every mind around me see to chapel take the hypo from him and inject him with it but she injects spock/henoch instead he leaps from his seat
fools ll simply transfer to another place another body he whirls around
sargon no sargon please let me let me transfer he falls to the floor and his victims are freed from their pain
spock my friend spock if there only been another way lights dim and glow then chapel wobbles
jim spock stands up
you re alive
there was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten vulcans that henoch would read your thoughts and believe it also
sargon
it seems doctor the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness
but your vessel was destroyed too where was your consciousness kept
the place henoch would least suspect captain
that is why was summoned into sickbay doctor mister spock consciousness was placed in me we shared consciousness together world my children thalassa and must now also depart into oblivion
is there any way we can help you sargon
yes my son you can allow thalassa and me to share your bodies again last moment together mulhall nods and they go over to the science station for the light trick and voice change
oblivion together does not frighten me beloved promise we ll be together
promise beloved
together forever
forever beloved forever they embrace and kiss and the light thing happens again during it
well sure that sargon appreciated your co-operation doctor mulhall
yes was happy to co-operate captain
it was beautiful
here the report on pollux five captain this entire system has been almost the same strange lack of intelligent life on the planets it bugs the percentages
bugs the well carry out the standard procedures on pollux four
aye sir
lieutenant you look bit tired this morning
well was up all night working on this report sir
well in that case there nothing like wee bit of coffee to get you back in shape join me carolyn
all right scotty just let me give this to mister spock
bones could you get that excited over cup of coffee
even from here can tell his pulse rate up
gentlemen come along my dear
not sure like that jim
why bones scotty good man
and he thinks he the right man for her but not sure she thinks he the right man on the other hand she woman all woman one day she ll find the right man and off she ll go out of the service
like to think of it not so much losing an officer as gaining
come along he and carolyn enter the turbolift
actually losing an officer
entering standard orbit around pollux four sir
cartographic detail stand by
standing by sir
preliminary reports mister spock
pollux four class type planet oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere sensors indicate no life forms approximate age four billion years judged no reason for contact in all respects quite ordinary captain
cartographic sections implement standard orders
all cartographic standards full automatic
captain
what in the name of where there was originally an image of nice blue and white planet there is now hand
analysis mister spock
momentarily
am seeing things
not unless am too captain that thing giant hand
what is it mister spock is it hand
negative captain not living tissue
trick then projection
not projection sir field of energy
hard about
hard about we can seem to get away from it
it almost as if it means to grab us
reverse all engines
all engines reverse everyone is thrown forward as the ship is grabbed by the hand and stopped in its tracks
we re dead still captain helm doesn answer we can move captain log stardate 3468 while approaching pollux four planet in the beta geminorum system the enterprise has been stopped in space by an unknown force of some kind
lieutenant relay our position and circumstances to starbase twelve immediately
aye aye sir
mister sulu try rocking the ship full impulse power forward and back
aye aye sir
damage report coming in captain situation under control minor damage stations three seven and nineteen
sickbay reports five minor injuries all being treated
thank you mister sulu
applying thrust sir no results captain we re stuck tight
mister spock status
the ship is almost completely encircled by the field it resembles conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths despite its appearance that of human appendage it is definitely not living tissue it is energy
thank you mister sulu our forward tractor beams adjust to repel
aye aye sir standing by
activate
ineffective captain there doesn seem to be anything to push against
captain most curious development on scanner five seven
let all take look at it mister spock
screen on captain now face appears in space male human wearing laurel wreath
activity on hailing channel three sir kirk; put it on audio lieutenant has come about you are most welcome my beloved children your places await you
response frequencies lieutenant
calculated channel open sir this bold venture so it was in the beginning you have made me proud now you can rest
this is captain james kirk commanding the uss enterprise please identify yourself sacramental wine there shall be the music of the pipes the long wait has ended
are you responsible for stopping the ship sails
give it back then we ll talk learned no patience in that time
don know who or what you are but must warn you we have the power to defend ourselves if you value your safety release this ship you are agamemnon hector odysseus
never mind the history lesson release the ship
external pressure building up captain eight hundred gsc and climbing
compensate
one thousand gsc and climbing the crew react to increasing air pressure becoming critical captain we can handle it
all right whatever you re doing turn it off you win
pressure is gone captain space normal on hull kirk invite you and your officers to join me but do not bring that one the one with the pointed ears he is much like pan and pan always bored me no sad faces this is time to rejoice not to fear you are returning home let your hearts prepare to sing
let go bones you in good voice
sure it wise jim
if we don accept his invitation we ll have crushed eggshell where this ship used to be
verbose isn he
insulted spock
insults are effective only where emotion is present
good we ll tackle him together we already know the questions you re the best man to find the answers kirk scott chekov mccoy and lt carolyn palamas beam down into lightly wooded area in front of greek temple
tricorders
what am doing down here doctor
well you re the and officer aren you archaeology anthropology ancient civilisations
correct
we re going to need help in all those areas
come on apollo is sitting on throne lyre by his feet
my children long have waited for this moment the memories you bring of your lush and beautiful earth the green fields and blue skies the simple shepherds and their flocks
you know of earth you ve been there
once stretched out my hand and earth trembled and breathed upon it and spring returned
you mentioned agamemnon hector odysseus how do you know about them
search your most distant memories those of the thousands of years past and am there your fathers knew me and your father fathers am apollo
and am the tsar of all the russias
mister chekov
sorry captain never met god before
and you haven yet readings doctor
simple humanoid captain
evidently not so simple
earth mother of the most beautiful of women in the universe that at least has not changed am pleased yes my children zeus athena aphrodite artemis gallant band of travellers we knew your earth well five thousand of your years ago
all right we re here at your invitation would you mind telling us what you want without all the olympian generalities
you will not leave this place
transporter room
your transportation device no longer functions
enterprise come in
will not permit that device to work either captain
what is it you want
you will worship me as your fathers did before you
if you want to play god and call yourself apollo that your business but you re no god to us mister
said you would worship me
and you ve got lot to learn
and so have you let the lesson begin apollo grows as tall as his temple welcome to olympus captain kirk enterprise is still held by the hand
mister spock can contact the landing party all frequencies are jammed
try to break through it lieutenant
aye sir
transporter and communications
very efficient mister sulu rig all transmission circuits for maximum power generation compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship
working sir
lieutenant kyle want complete sensor scan of the planet
aye sir
locate all the lifeforms want to know what going on down there the giant apollo suddenly looks weary and vanishes
to coin phrase fascinating
analysis lieutenant palamas what do you know about apollo
apollo twin brother of artemis son of the god zeus and leto mortal he was the god of light and purity he was skilled in the bow and lyre
and this thing the temple
obviously he has some knowledge of earth his classical references and the appearance of all this
think the appearance of this is for our benefit bones
can say much till check our these readings he looks human but of course that doesn mean thing
whatever he is he seems to control remarkable technology
power is what he controls you can do tricks like that without energy
fine but what power and where is it scout around with your tricorders find the source of that power bones scott chekov and carolyn wander off
yes
bones wonder if five thousand years ago
you have theory
have an idea what if he is really apollo
what
captain apollo is back on his throne
want from you that which is rightfully mine your loyalty your tribute and your worship
may ask what you offer in exchange for this worship
life in paradise as simple and as pleasureful as it was those thousands of years ago on that beautiful planet so far away
apollo we re willing to talk but you ll find we don bow to every creature who happens to have bag of tricks
agamemnon was one such as you and hercules pride and arrogance they defied me until they felt my wrath
would like to point out that we are quite capable of some wrath ourselves
have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there
no you do not captain they are mine to save to cherish or to destroy at my will
but why what you ve said so far makes no sense at all
how like aphrodite and athena the beauty grace and you seem wise for woman what is your name
lieutenant palamas
mean your name
carolyn
carolyn yes you are beautiful you would do aphrodite credit will tell you thousand tales stories of courage and love you will know what it is to be goddess
leave her alone
you protest you risk much
and so do you scott draws his phaser and apollo blasts it out of his hand with point of his finger chekov finds his phaser doesn work
scotty picks up the twisted and melted weapon very impressive how you do it
ve grown weary of discussion and argument
captain the phasers all the working parts are fused
none of your toys will function yes you are beauty but like artemis the bow arm should be bare he waves his hand and her clothes turn into greek-style draperies with her hair piled very tall
oh it beautiful
yes come he takes her hand and leads her away
she not going with you scott gets thrown over table with flick of the wrist
he shall learn the discipline of the temple so shall you all come
it all right captain ll go
without fear she is fit indeed they both vanish as they walk away
bones how is he
stunned but coming around not sure it wise to let her go off like that
he would have been rather difficult to stop
you saw how capricious he is benevolent one minute angry the next one more wrong move from her and he could kill her
mister chekov think you better continue your investigation
aye aye sir leaves
how do you feel scotty
am tingling all over did he take her with him
it would seem so
captain we ve got to stop him he wants her the way he looks at her
mister scott understand your concern over her but she volunteered to go with him hopefully to find out more about him she doing her job think it about time you started doing yours we ve got to find out the source of his power you ve got tricorder use it if you re able to
able sir
and one more thing want no more unauthorised action against apollo or whatever he is that an order
aye aye sir
besides you stiff-necked thistle head you could have gotten yourself killed
aye leaves
scotty doesn believe in gods
apollo no god but he could have been taken for one though once say five thousand years ago highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on earth around the mediterranean
yes to the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early greece creatures like that would have been gods
especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy in fact they couldn have been taken for anything else
ready to reverse polarity mister sulu
computed and standing by to generate sir
activate all units the ship jolts several times but
no good mister spock we didn even faze it we re still locked tight
cut power mister sulu lieutenant we must restore communications with the landing party
working sir but can do anything with this
oh
might be able to rig up subspace bypass circuit
good do so sensor report mister kyle
ve located the landing party but one of them seems separated from the other four
and apollo
ve just picked up readings for our own people sir
mister spock here something there seems to be radiated energy pulsation coming from the planet don know what it is sir
origin
can seem to pinpoint it
would suggest mister sulu if you cannot find out where the power source is you should find out where it is not simple process of elimination
the whole planet sir yes sir the whole planet at marble bench by tranquil water scene
oh it lovely
ve known other women daphne cassandra but none more beautiful than you are you frightened of me
frightened no don think so of course girl doesn go walking with
god
all right god every day what happened to the others artemis hera
they returned to the cosmos on the wings of the wind
you mean they died
no not as you understand it we re immortal we gods but the earth changed your fathers changed they turned away until we were only memories god cannot survive as memory we need love admiration worship as you need food
you really think you re god
in real sense we were gods we had the power of life and death we could have struck out from olympus and destroyed we have no wish to destroy so we came home again it was an empty place without worshippers but we had no strength to leave so we waited all of us through the long years
but you said the others didn die
even for god there point of no return hera was first she stood in front of the temple and spread herself upon the wind thinner and thinner until only the wind remained but knew you would come you striving bickering foolishly brave humans knew you would come to the stars one day of all the gods knew and waited waited for you to come and sit by my side
don understand
even five thousand years ago the gods took mortals to them to love to care for like zeus took leto my mother we were gods of passion of love they kiss
there is repeated occurrence of registrations regular pulsating pattern of radiated energy
unquestionably an immensely powerful field of energy is being generated around here somewhere we re just having difficulty focusing on it
apollo has no difficulty focusing he taps that energy mister scott
sir some creatures can generate and control energy with no harm to themselves the electric eel on earth the giant dry worm of antos four the fluffy
not the whole encyclopaedia chekov
the captain requires complete information
spock contaminating this boy jim
are you suggesting that he apollo taps flow of energy and channels it through his body
that would seem most likely sir
mister chekov think you ve earned your pay for the week but where is the source of that power
number one on our list of things to do
is that all you have to offer
yes except my estimation for his physical condition in spite of apollo bag of tricks he comes up essentially normal with just few variations however there an extra organ in his chest that can even make guess about
bones is it possible
jim apollo walks back in out of thin air
where lieutenant palamas
she is no longer of any concern to you
you bloodthirsty saracen what have you done with her scott picks up statuette and rushes at apollo he gets another finger blast of electricity for his effort
scotty
not good severe shock
all right mister you wanted worshippers you ve got enemies you want us to bow down you ll have to kirk clutches his throat and falls to the ground choking
you will learn discipline you will learn again he suddenly becomes tired and vanishes
chekov give me hand
take care of scotty
are you all right captain
where apollo
he disappeared again like the cat in that russian story
don you mean the english story the cheshire cat
cheshire no sir minsk perhaps but
all right all right all right
sir there is something noticed apollo looked very strange when he disappeared tired or in pain don know if it means anything
very good mister chekov that might very well mean something
how do you feel
can get my arm to move
some neural damage
we ve got to get out of here
how
well let assume that five thousand years ago creatures like our friend apollo did indeed visit earth and form the basis of the greek classic myths
makes sense
most mythology has its basis in fact if remember my ancient legends the gods after expending energy required rest even as we humans
and apollo gone after attacking you and mister scott you think maybe he off somewhere recharging his energy cells
something like that remember he keeping force field on the ship and he expending energy down here you said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared if we can wear him out overwork him that might do it
the trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed
if we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again there chance that he ll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him
still say it can get us killed
not all of us bones when he comes back it chance we ll have to take uhura is underneath the communications station doing some soldering
progress report
connecting the bypass circuit now sir it should take another half hour
speed is essential lieutenant
mister spock haven done anything like this in years if it isn done just right could blow the entire communications system it very delicate work sir
can think no one better equipped to handle it miss uhura please proceed
yes sir right away
progress mister sulu
sectors one through twenty five charted and examined no chance at all of power originating in those areas
continue the search
aye sir fourteen by twenty six index
mister kyle
yes sir
we re unable to break completely loose from this force field but we might be able to punch some holes through it
what for sir
to shoot through it might also relieve lieutenant uhura communications problem take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas that might be done by generating strong pinpoint charge of m-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines
right away sir apollo reappears on his throne carolyn standing by his side
come here know you re trying to escape me it useless know everything you do tried to be compassionate toward your kind
you know nothing about our kind you know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks your tricks don frighten us neither do you we ve come long way in five thousand years
but you re of the same nature could sweep you out of existence with wave of my hand and bring you back again can give life or death what else does mankind demand of its gods
mankind has no need for gods we find the one quite adequate
we shall not debate mortal offer you eternal rest and happiness according to the ancient ways ask little in return but what ask for insist upon approach me the four men turn their backs on him said approach me
we re busy quietly look after the girl
you will gather laurel leaves light the ancient fires kill deer make your sacrifices to me apollo has spoken
go gather laurel leaves you must be joking
ha ha ha ha
kill deer that the funniest thing ever heard
captain
lieutenant get back
you shall reap the rewards of your insolence
we re tired of your phony fireworks
mortal you have earned this
no don
lieutenant
father doesn destroy his children you said you were gentle and understanding
lieutenant
how can they worship you if you hurt them
lieutenant
apollo please taking his hand you know so much of love please don hurt them please
shall be lenient with you for her sake you will make plans to bring the rest of your people down be sure your artisans bring tools you will need homes
and you will supply the herds of sheep and the pipes we ll play and the simple skins we ll wear for clothes
you will dismantle your ship for the supplies you need and ll crush its empty hull have been too patient shall be patient no longer he disappears with carolyn still holding his hand
captain we ve got to do something
we were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us
any more good ideas jim
yes have one more and it depends on the lieutenant loyalty if she fails us we better get used to herding goats
fools offer them more than they could know not just world but all that makes it up man thinks he progressed they re wrong he merely forgotten those things which gave life meaning you ll all be provided for cared for happy there is an order of things in this universe your species has denied it come to restore it and for you because you have the sensitivity to understand offer you more than your wildest dreams have ever imagined you ll become the mother of new race of gods you ll inspire the universe all men will revere you almost as god yourself and shall love you for time without end worlds without end you shall complete me and you she embraces him happily
kirk to enterprise come in enterprise come in kirk to enterprise come in kirk to
carolyn what happened to her
scotty ll find out
perhaps if assisted
how old are you
twenty two sir
then better handle it goes over to very satisfied looking woman you all right
oh yes all right have message for you
come over there well
he wants us to live in peace he wants to provide for us he ll give us everything we ever wanted and he can do it too
all right lieutenant you can come down from mount olympus now you ve got work to do
don understand
he thrives on love worship attention
yes
we can give him that worship none of us can especially you
what
spurn him reject him you must you re special to him
yes love him
lieutenant all our lives here and on the ship depend on you
no not on me
on you lieutenant reject him and we have chance to save ourselves accept him and you condemn all of us to slavery nothing less than slavery we might never get help this far out or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you
oh but you don understand he kind and he wants the best for us and he so lonely what you ask would break his heart how can
give me your hand your hand she does now feel that human flesh against human flesh we re the same we share the same history the same heritage the same lives we re tied together beyond any untying man or woman it makes no difference we re human we couldn escape from each other even if we wanted to that how you do it lieutenant by remembering who and what you are bit of flesh and blood afloat in universe without end the only thing that truly yours is the rest of humanity that where our duty lies do you understand me
yes yes understand he calling me
lieutenant you have your orders and your duty
yes sir my orders and my duty she walks away slowly looking back
think we can try it now sir enterprise to captain kirk enterprise to captain kirk come in captain
kirk here
spock here captain the rest of the men gather to listen which seems to have something to do with the force field
is there structure of some sort near you
there is indeed mister spock
very good how are you doing on the force field
we can negate sections of it creating openings through which we can fire our phaser banks
well that ought to do it have sulu lock all phaser banks onto the structure fire on my order only cut it fine we ll be standing nearby ]bridge]
captain would recommend discreet distance together besides we have apollo to deal with
if that structure is the source of his power want to know where he is when we attack it
bones do you think that mysterious organ in apollo chest could have something to do with the transmission of energy
well it doesn serve any other purpose know of
captain we ve got to wait until carolyn comes back before we fire on the temple we don know what would happen to her if he was suddenly attacked she might get killed
yes know know scotty we ll wait there some very passionate kissing going on
must say apollo the way you ape human behaviour is remarkable but there are some other things must know your evolutionary patterns and your social development
my what
sure they re unique ve never encountered specimen like you before
am apollo ve chosen you
sure that very flattering but must get on with my work now
your work
scientist my particular specialty is ancient civilisations relics and myths surely you know ve only been studying you
don believe it you love me
love you be logical not some simple shepherdess you can awe why could no more love you than could love new species of bacteria
carolyn forbid you to go order you to stay
is that the secret of your power over women the thunderbolts you throw she walks away and strong wind begins to blow thunder rumbles
what the devil is that
answers communicator kirk here
sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area
stand by your phasers mister spock prepare to fire on my signal kirk out
captain we ve got to go and find her
we ve got to be here when he comes back
but what if he doesn what if he
scotty just hold on carolyn falls to the ground in the strong winds and giant image of apollo looms over her amid the lightning flashes
captain
all right the temple is his power source let bring him back to it get to cover mister spock fire those phasers
fire those phasers that an order mister spock
all phaser banks fire the white marble starts to glow pink under the phaser beams and apollo runs back
no stop stop say enterprise shudders under his anger there is no longer hand holding the ship
all phaser banks maintain firing rate
more power to the shields
stop carolyn totters into view and scotty dashes to her
scotty
stop say the temple is now yellow command it
all banks maintain firing rate
maintaining sir
stop stop stop his lightning bolts end and the temple dissolves into rubble scott helps carolyn to her feet as apollo walks around surveying the ruins
would have cherished you cared for you would have loved you as father loves his children did ask so much
we ve out grown you you asked for something we could no longer give
carolyn loved you would have made goddess of you ve shown you my open heart see what you ve done to me he becomes giant
zeus hermes hera aphrodite you were right athena you were right the time has passed there is no room for gods forgive me my old friends take me take me and he disappears one last time carolyn cries
wish we hadn had to do this
so do they gave us so much the greek civilisation much of our culture and philosophy came from worship of those beings in way they began the golden age would it have hurt us wonder just to have gathered few laurel leaves captain log stardate 4307 approaching starbase six for much needed period of rest and recreation
the crew has performed excellently but is exhausted and too am looking forward to nice period of rest on some lovely planet
captain there was message from starbase six heavy interference all get is intrepid and what sounded like sector co-ordinate
interesting no indications of magnetic storms in this sector
try another channel lieutenant
aye sir
the intrepid is manned by vulcans isn it
yes that right bones
enterprise calling starbase six enterprise calling starbase six come in come in spock suddenly jerks upright his face picture of horror
spock
what is it spock are you in pain
captain the intrepid it just died and the four hundred vulcans aboard all dead
come on spock let go down to sickbay
doctor know what know
get to the sickbay
captain
no no no that an order
yes sir mccoy leads him away
captain have starbase six readable now switching to audio sir
kirk here go ahead
sir the enterprise just completed an exhausting mission we re on our way in for and there must be another starship in that sector contact with solar system gamma seven-a which the intrepid was investigating and we ve just lost contact with the intrepid report progress
order acknowledged kirk out mister kyle you heard the order set course for gamma seven-a warp five
aye sir
captain have just completed full long-range scan of gamma seven-a system it is dead
dead it fourth magnitude sun there are billions of inhabitants there
it is dead spock is on biobed being scanned
assure you doctor am quite all right the pain was momentary it passed quickly
all of my instruments seem to agree with you if can trust these crazy vulcan readings spock how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed spock gets off the bed
sensed it die
but thought you had to be in physical contact with subject before
doctor even half-vulcan could hear the death scream of four hundred vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us
not even vulcan could feel starship die
call it deep understanding of the way things happen to vulcans but know not person not even the computers on board the intrepid knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known
but four hundred vulcans
ve noticed that about your people doctor you find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of million you speak about the objective hardness of the vulcan heart yet how little room there seems to be in yours
suffer the death of thy neighbour eh spock you wouldn wish that on us would you
it might have rendered your history bit less bloody
spock you may have been right we ve lost contact with the intrepid and we re out of communication with an entire solar system any update from starfleet
cannot filter out the distortion sir it getting worse
captain deflector shields just snapped on
slow to warp three
warp three sir
indications of energy turbulence ahead unable to analyse ve never encountered readings like this before
scanners on magnification three on the screen
magnification factor three sir
exactly what are we looking for mister spock
would assume that in the middle of the viewscreen is black blob
what is that
perhaps an interstellar dust cloud
not very likely ensign
no you be able to see stars through dust cloud looks like hole in space readings mister spock
still not able to analyse captain sensors are feeding data to the computers now whatever this dark zone is it lies directly in line with the course calculate for the intrepid and the gamma seven-a system
hold present course slow to warp one
warp factor one sir
mister chekov prepare to launch telemetry probe into that zone direct computer feed to mister spock
aye sir probe ready switching data feed to library computer
launch probe
probe launched sir high pitched sound comes over the speakers
what was that
the telemetry probe sir there no signal from it
speculation spock
have none captain insufficient data chekov is still groaning and uhura looses her balance
lieutenant
just dizzy ll be all right fine sir
kirk here what is it this ship just fainted
uhura almost did she says she all right do you want to see her
not unless she feeling ill ve got an emergency here crew are queued out of the door getting shots from chapel
there nothing organic they all seem to be nervous weak and irritable they say it happened suddenly like balloon popping
giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet
good kirk out hold our position mister kyle
aye aye sir
spock give me an update on the dark area ahead
no analysis due to insufficient information
no speculation no information nothing ve asked you three times for information on that and you ve been unable to supply it insufficient data is not sufficient mister spock you re the science officer you re supposed to have sufficient data all the time
am well aware of that captain but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon it is beyond our experience and the new information is not yet significant
don know about you but tired if you can tell me what it is let use reverse logic perhaps it ll help if you tell me what it isn
it is not liquid gaseous or solid despite the fact we cannot see through it
so far that not much help
it is not galactic nebula such as the coal sack and since our deflectors were activated by it it would seem to be some form of energy but nothing our sensors can identify
is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the intrepid
very possible
lieutenant
yes sir
notify the starfleet that we re going to attempt to probe the area of darkness to gain further information
aye aye sir kirk pauses exhausted on his way back to his chair
captain
all right distance from zone of darkness mister kyle
one hundred thousand kilometres sir
ahead slow impulse power only
aye aye sir
transmission to starfleet complete sir
very good time mister chekov
penetration of the zone in one minute seven seconds sir
red alert deflectors full power phaser banks ready
phasers standing by deflectors at full power sir that eardrum splitting sound comes again
it not coming from communications sir
spock
analysing now captain the sound goes
captain the stars are gone the viewscreen is completely blank
malfunction mister spock
negative captain all systems functioning properly
then kindly tell me what happened to the stars
unknown captain
kirk to mccoy
things any better down there
have you got anything that will help up here don want anybody folding on the bridge at critical moment
kirk to engineering scotty there was power loss how come
we lost five percent of our energy reserve sir our deflector shields are weakened
aye if we don lose any more don ask me how it happened
am asking how mister want answers kirk out mccoy enters with nurse and starts injecting the crew
what that
stimulant
bones how bad is it
two thirds of the personnel are affected
why how do you have any answers
no you know you ll get everything can tell you but when there is nothing what should say the man at the engineering station collapses
nurse
this ship is in trouble we better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones we seem to be in the middle of creeping paralysis mister spock analysis of that last burst of noise before we started losing power
that sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of boundary layer captain
what boundary layer
unknown
boundary layer between what and what
between where we were and where we are
are you trying to be funny mister spock
it would never occur to me captain
do you have any ideas spock
we still have no specifics but we seem to have entered zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes as we draw closer to the source it grows stronger and we grow weaker
recommendations
have one recommend survival let get out of here
this is the captain we re on difficult mission but it not the first time our orders do not say stay alive or retreat
we have no guarantees but we have good ship and the best crew in starfleet so do your jobs carry on kirk out
sickbay to captain kirk
jim according to the life indicators the energy levels
yes say it bones
according to the life monitors we re dying captain log stardate 4308 it is now ten minutes since we entered the zone of darkness we have stopped engines while we seek defence against the energy drain which seems to pervade the zone kirk enters and is promptly thrown sideways by massive jolt to the ship
are you all right
yes
what was that
sorry sir not sure was trying to recalibrate and we went into reverse
reverse but that was forward lurch how could that happen in reverse thrust
don know sir all know is that the power levels are down twelve percent and steadily decreasing ve never experienced anything like it
kirk here
sir we are accelerating we are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness
unknown captain suggest you order mister scott to give us reverse power
he just gave us reverse power we lurched forward
in that case captain would suggest we apply forward thrust
doctor life function indicators they ve started sharp drop again
stimulants don know how long we can keep this up
what do you think scotty forward thrust
don know sir it goes against the rules of logic
yes doesn it well if it doesn work ll never let spock live it down notch it into forward
but
go ahead
that doing it sir we re slowing down but we re not stopping we re still being dragged forward
have one of your engineers monitor the instruments keep applying thrust against the pull
doctor they seem to be stabilising
but at dangerously low level well we re still alive suppose that something
all can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness the weaker our life functions become and have no idea why all right it those stimulants they catch up with you
engineering
as to the power levels are concerned everything is acting backwards but the drain is continuing on the static test could only get sixty percent power we re still being dragged forward
spock
it logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced whatever it is it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the intrepid
the same thing not the zone itself
would say not captain the analysis of the zone indicates it is negative energy field however illogical that may sound but it is not the source of the power drain
maybe it shield of some kind some form of protection for something else
but what
we ll find out what it is but we better get out of here ourselves scotty channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward that might snap us out of the zone
aye captain but ll reserve some for the shields in case we don get out
submit mister scott if we do not get out the shields would be extraneous it would only prolong our wait for death by short period of time
use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here scotty report to your stations continue your research dismissed the department heads leave kirk and spock alone
captain the intrepid would have done all these things too and yet they were destroyed
well they may not have done all of these things you just pointed out how illogical this situation is
true it is also true they never knew what was killing them their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed
explain
vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory the memory goes back so far that no vulcan can conceive of conqueror knew the ship was lost because sensed it
what was it you sensed
the touch of death
and what do you think they felt
astonishment scott is working on the upper level
that ought to do it engineering to captain kirk
kirk here what is it scotty
ready to try it when you are sir
do we have the power to pull it off scotty
stand by all hands this is the captain we are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force we re going to apply
in the hope that it will yank us out of the zone prepare yourselves all right scotty let get on with it everybody braces themselves against the g-forces that are created by the acceleration what happened to the inertial dampers then there sudden jolt and people get thrown around chapel is flung into mccoy arms for example
scotty against the pull and hold our position
are we still losing power
aye sir
at this rate plus the drain on all systems two hours
maintain thrust scotty while we re maintaining our distance mister spock have you ascertained yet what we re maintaining our distance from
cannot say what it is captain but would say it has found us the viewscreen is no longer black it contains multicoloured image rather like an abalone
prepare to launch probe mister chekov
aye sir probe ready for launch sir
getting very confused readings captain but this is definitely the source of the energy drain
launch probe
probe launched sir
probe will impact in seven point three seconds
six five four three two one the ship shudders
are we still in contact with the probe
yes sir data being relayed to mister spock
readings coming in now captain length approximately eleven thousand miles width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles outer layer studded with space debris and waste interior consists of protoplasm varying from firmer gelatinous layer to semi-fluid central mass condition living
magnification four
magnification four sir
that is what is drawing us toward it captain the same way it drew the intrepid to her death there is an image of single-celled organism on screen
that is an amoeba
yes remember my basic biology doctor you mean to tell me that that thing is giant single-celled animal
yes for lack of better term it very simple form of life in fact it much simpler form of life than what you re looking at now but that thing can apparently perform all the functions that qualify it as living organism it can reproduce it can breathe it can eat although don know what
energy itself perhaps drained from us would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like virus
the intrepid died of that particular virus how is it we survived
the intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy still hungry we are not safe captain we merely have little more time than the intrepid did
what about this zone of darkness does the organism generate it itself as form of protection
it one of the things we ve got to find out we ve got to take closer look at it
the closer we get the faster our energy drains out we re barely surviving at this distance
perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft perhaps with protective shield
not sending anyone anywhere unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing if it can be destroyed
must differ with you captain we have sent unmanned probes into it they have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it hoping to kill it
we could send one man in pinpoint its vulnerable spots
do you know what the odds are in coming back can order man to do that
who said anything about an order jim you ve got volunteer ve done the preliminary work
it suicide mission
the thing evidently has reflexes the unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered the lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction
all right so know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots
you have martyr complex doctor submit that it disqualifies you
do you think intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since
the vulcans saw it first and died
just because the vulcans failed
am more capable
gentlemen am not taking volunteers
you don think you re going
better qualified as command pilot than you are
which makes you indispensable captain further you are not science specialist
jim that organism contains chemical processes we ve never seen before and may never see again we could learn more in one day
we don have one day doctor we have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left
jim
captain
gentlemen ll decide
captain personal log stardate 4309 we have established that the thing which destroyed the uss intrepid and the gamma seven=a system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life both mister spock and doctor mccoy have volunteered to go in specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell find way to destroy it and free the ship doctor mccoy has the medical-biological knowledge mister spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the stress both are right both are capable and which of my friends do condemn to death this is the captain mister spock doctor mccoy report to my quarters immediately kirk out
engineering to captain kirk
you asked me to keep you informed on the power drain all levels are down fifty percent now thrust for another hour and fifteen minutes spock and mccoy enter
very well prepare the shuttlecraft for launching
doctor mccoy will tell you what special equipment to put in kirk out sorry mister spock
right ll get few things need jim
not you bones sorry mister spock you re best qualified to go
do not suffer so doctor this is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials
nothing has been proven yet spock the dna code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing you ll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder
am familiar with the equipment doctor we re wasting time the shuttlecraft is ready
you re determined not to let me share in this aren you
this is not competition doctor whether you understand it or not grant me my own kind of dignity
vulcan dignity how can grant you what don understand
then employ one of your own superstitions wish me luck silence and stares then mccoy opens the hangar deck door spock walks across and into the galileo the doors shut
good luck spock
all systems clear for shuttlecraft launch sir
launch shuttlecraft
shuttlecraft away sir
lieutenant uhura channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers
aye aye sir
come in spock
power drain is enormous and growing worse
chekov chekov goes to the science station enters ll continue communications as long as there is power to transmit
captain won have enough power to get back out if he diverts it to his shields
spock
we discussed that possibility earlier but you will need this information
slowing now contact in eighteen point three seconds brace yourselves the area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive contact spock is thrown around in the shuttlecraft everyone on the ship just feels jolt
report mister spock spock report percent power reserve before the shields stabilised
there was nothing to spare shall continue my tests oh and doctor mccoy you would have not survived it
you want to bet
am moving slowly now establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus
sir mister spock has reduced life-support systems to bare minimum
spock save your power for the shields
calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes chromosome structure
changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence
you mean there ll be two of those things
spock do you read me spock do you read me co-ordinates of chromosome bodies
spock come in come in
contact lost sir the ship shakes
he alive he kicked it in the side to let us know
captain getting telemetry
mister chekov telemetry analysis as it comes in
according to spock telemetry information there are over forty chromosomes in the nucleus that are ready to come together ready to reproduce
if the energy of that organism only doubles we re dead and everything within light year will be defenceless
well all know is that soon there ll be two four eight and more the entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy
spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the chromosomes we must destroy that organism
captain the pull from that organism is increasing and the power drain from our shields is getting critical
how much time do we have
no more than an hour now sir
put all secondary systems on standby shield power has unconditional priority
aye sir
captain receiving message from mister spock on low-energy channel it faint but it is readable
put it on lieutenant
on audio sir
am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies according to my calculations nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane relatively insensitive to interior irritation believe sufficient charge of inaudible could destroy the organism tell doctor mccoy he should have wished me luck captain log stardate 4309 we have determined we can destroy the creature provided we can do it from inside the organism spock clearly knew how to destroy it but was unable to transmit that information
how do you feel
what on your mind
spock is it me jim am so sentimental that just have to keep believing that he still alive in that mass of protoplasm
he knew the odds when he went out there just as you did when you volunteered to go what is that thing out there bones it not intelligent not yet
it disease like virus invading the body of our galaxy
yes it is isn it how many cells does the human body have
millions
this thing this cell this virus it eleven thousand miles long and it one cell when it grows into millions we ll be the virus invading its body
now isn that thought here we are antibodies of our own galaxy attacking an invading germ it would be ironic indeed if that were our sole destiny wouldn it
antibodies antibodies goes to desk monitor bridge
scotty how much power do we have left
we re down to forty three percent sir we re slipping bit against the pull that beastie putting on us minutes at this rate of decline less if have to apply more thrust
what would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields except for impulse power keep that in reserve
cut the engine thrust we be sucked into that thing like being caught in wind tunnel sir
exactly prepare to divert power on my signal kirk out kirk leans against the monitor tired mccoy scans him
have you got something to say
technically no medically yes between the stimulants and the pressure would suggest you try to stay off your feet for few minutes
don have few minutes bones maybe none of us do let go
all hands this is the captain we re going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly would think damage control parties stand by all decks secure for collision kirk out
ready scotty
switching power to shields impulse in reserve cutting thrust to zero now
impact five seconds there big bump and people are thrown all over the place then there is calm
we re through sir
believe everybody is aware of that mister chekov
damage control parties report minimal damage sir repairs are being initiated
very good lieutenant
captain we ve only twenty six percent power reserves after entry
do we have impulse power scotty
saved all could sir but don know whether we have enough to get back out again or time either
we are committed
aye we are but we re committed to what we have no power for the phasers
we couldn use it we cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there
that thing would probably like phasers it eats power
then what the devil begging your pardon sir are we doing
mister spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact
we can use the power to destroy it
anti-power
what
this thing has negative energy charge everything seems to work in reverse we ll use anti-matter
aye it couldn swallow that
mister chekov prepare probe scotty we ll need magnetic bottle for the charge how soon
it on its way sir
mister chekov we ll use timing detonator for the probe work out setting
aye sir
helmsman when do you estimate arrival at nucleus
seven minutes sir
how close are you going to it
point blank range we ll implant it then back away
why the probe has range of
with the eddies and currents in that protoplasm the probe could drift thousands of kilometres we must be exactly on target because we won have second chance bones time for another stimulant
how long do you think you can keep taking that stuff it ll blow you apart
keep me together for another seven minutes that all need
personal log commander spock uss enterprise have noted the passage of the enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it if this record should survive me wish it known that bequeath my highest commendation and testimonial to the captain officers and crew of the enterprise the finest starship in the fleet
also making log entry we have arrived at the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism if we should fail in our attempt to destroy it or be unable to free ourselves wish to record my recommendations for the following personnel that they receive special citation lieutenant commander leonard mccoy lieutenant commander montgomery scott officers chekov kyle uhura and my highest commendation for commander spock science officer who gave his life in the performance of his duty
target co-ordinates programmed sir probe ready for launch
mister scott how much time do we have left at one hundred percent impulse power
six maybe seven minutes sir
mister kyle programme fuse for seven minute delay all non-essential systems on standby communications scanning conserve every bit of power we must make it through the membrane before that thing explodes make it work scotty
aye sir
programming complete ready for launch
launch probe at zero acceleration forward thrust off one tenth of second
forward thrust off sir
probe launched sir there little jolt
despite what spock said it still plenty sensitive
probe confirmed it is lodged in the nucleus near the chromosome bodies
mister kyle back us out the way we came in mister chekov nice straight line don waste any time
backing out sir
estimate we ll be out in six point thirty seven minutes
very good
captain metallic substance outside the ship
spock
lieutenant get me spock voice channel highest possible gain
go ahead sir
spock do you read me do you read me spock do you read me come in spock spock scotty get tractor beam
captain we don have enough time to do it we only have fifty three second escape margin
well aware of that mister scott get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft
aye sir tractor beams on
do not risk the ship further on my behalf
shut up spock we re rescuing you
why thank you captain mccoy
almost out we re approaching the membrane sir
time until explosion
fifty seven seconds sir
maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft mister scott
aye sir can guarantee it ll hold when the warhead explodes the power levels are looks at readout the power levels are dead sir
you may have just written our epitaph mister scott the warhead must have exploded because everyone goes flying around the bridge again
activate main viewing screen they see stars mister chekov report
the organism is destroyed sir the explosion must have ruptured the membrane and thrown us clear
power coming back sir
shuttlecraft
don know how sir but it still with us
shuttlecraft to enterprise shuttlecraft to enterprise request permission to come aboard
spock you re alive
obviously captain and have some fascinating data on the organism
don be so smart spock you botched the acetylcholine test
later later later bring the shuttlecraft aboard mister scott
aye sir
prepare to receive shuttlecraft received shuttlecraft hangar doors closed hangar deck pressurising
mister chekov lay in course for starbase six ahead warp factor five still looking forward to nice period of rest and relaxation on some lovely gazes at yeoman planet kirk and spock are standing by large purple boulder
our scanner survey was correct captain there it is pure tritanium
fantastic 20 times as hard as diamond
twenty one point four times as hard to be exact
thank you mister spock into communicator scotty you can mark this vein as confirmed inform starfleet recommend that they dispatch survey vessel immediately unseen by the landing party cloud of smoke is coming out of another rock and heading for them this rich find
we won be able to break it captain ll phaser off specimen he does so and the smoke retreats
lesley he is handed pair of tongs to pick up the sample with
do you smell that sweet odour like honey it was years ago on another planet thing with an odour like that
we re in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet there are doubtless many pollen aromas
rizzo
yes sir
take your men make swing around our perimeter scan for dikironium in the atmosphere set your phasers on disrupter-b if you see any gaseous cloud fire immediately you re on red alert make sweep
negative scotty we re checking something out than eight hours captain that doesn give us much time
acknowledged continue standing by kirk out
captain dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments
it gone could have been wrong the last time caught an odour like that was eleven years ago the three red-shirts have run into clearing
seemed to read dikironium for minute and then lost it it almost like something out there knows scanning it it kind of keeps changing itself into something different that isn possible nothing can do that all together now it behind you the other two security men fall to the ground choking in the cloud rizzo can get clear shot
captain
kirk here
captain it reaches him and he starts choking too
cloud cloud
fire into it immediately but by the time they get there the cloud has gone
spock dead and you ll find every red corpuscle gone from their body
rizzo alive barely
kirk to enterprise scotty lock in on us medical emergency
you think you know what it was captain
something that can possibly exist but it does captain log stardate 3619 with the mysterious death of two crewmen all personnel on the planet have been evacuated back to the ship
autopsy report doctor
how ensign rizzo
still unconscious sir
transfusions
continuing as rapidly as possible his blood count is still sixty percent less than normal leaves
kirk to bridge
hold your position expecting to rendezvous with us in less than seven hours
then you ll inform them that we might be little late
jim the yorktown ship surgeon will want to know how late those vaccines he transferring to us are highly perishable badly needed on planet theta seven they are expecting us to get them there on time
gentlemen we are remaining in orbit until find out more about those deaths on my responsibility am perfectly aware that it might cost lives on theta seven kirk out autopsy report
you saw their colour there wasn red corpuscle left in their bodies
marks cuts incisions of any kind
not one what happened is medically impossible
suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar occurrences you ll find the uss farragut lists casualties eleven years ago from exactly the same impossible causes
thank you captain ll check those tapes immediately
first can you bring ensign rizzo to consciousness for moment
yes but it
will it hurt him if you do so
in his present condition don think it would make much difference
then do so
transfusion completed sir his pulse and respiration are still far below normal
give him one cc of cordazine nurse
yes sir
rizzo this is the captain can you hear me do you remember what happened to you
remember cold so cold
you were attacked by something when it happened did you notice an odour of any kind rizzo rizzo do you remember sickly sweet odour did you smell it
yes yes smell strange smell it was like being smothered in honey
did you feel presence an intelligence
it was trying to draw strength from us felt it it was it was it was there
he beginning to sleep again can risk another shot
he already told me what wanted to know
wouldn depend too much what he says in that half-conscious state he could be dreaming saying what he thought you wanted to hear
you check those record tapes want your medical analysis as quickly as possible leaves
what with the captain ve never seen him like that before
intend to find out ll be in the medical record library
oh captain subspace message from starfleet they re inquiring
not now have the security duty officer report to me immediately
aye sir
spock
continuing scanning still no readings of life forms on the planet
let assume that it something so completely different that our sensors wouldn identify it as life form
you mentioned dikironium captain
suppose it was composed of that rare element strange gaseous creature
ve scanned for that element captain there no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere
suppose it camouflaged itself let assume that it intelligent that it knows we re looking for it
to hide from sensor scan it would have to be able to change its molecular structure like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory
you ve just suggested something that never occurred to me it may provide some answers to tape record which think you ll find doctor mccoy is looking at this very moment
chekov take over on scanner as spock steps into the turbolift garrovick steps out onto the bridge
ensign garrovick reporting sir
are you the new security officer
yes sir
was your father
yes sir but don expect any special treatment on that account
you ll get none aboard this ship mister
yes sir
captain have report on ensign rizzo he dead sir
you knew rizzo
yes sir we were good friends graduated the academy together
you ll get crack at what killed him interested
yes am sir
want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect join me in the transporter room in five minutes you ll accompany me to the planet surface
yes sir
reading is changing sir
spock was right notice the molecular shift
dikironium reading now sir bearing ninety four mark seven angle of elevation six degrees holding steady
over that rise take two men circle around to the left ll take the other two and go the other way that creature is dangerous if you see it fire full phasers
yes sir
swensen bardoli come with me garrovick and his group go into clearing and the cloud emerges garrovick fires at it after slight hesitation
phaser come on arriving at the scene garrovick did you but then he sees the other two security men lying on the ground skin pale as snow captain log stardate 3619 one of the men in critical condition the other is dead and am now even more convinced that this is not only an intelligent creature but the same which decimated the crew of the uss farragut eleven years ago in another part of the galaxy both spock and mccoy are doubtful of this and sense they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing why am keeping the ship here kirk is already there when spock mccoy and garrovick enter
mister garrovick we ve studied your report mister spock begin
what was the size of the thing you saw ensign
say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres sir it varied in size fluctuated as it moved
composition
it was like gaseous cloud parts of it could see through other parts were more dense
ensign did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud
did what sir
did you get any subconscious impressions that this was creature living thinking thing rather than just strange cloud of chemical elements
no sir
but you didn come to actual contact with it did you
no sir was furthest away from it it seemed to come out of nowhere hovered for moment then moved toward my men it was fast incredibly fast
did you say it hovered
yes sir
you did fire at it didn you
yes sir did
what distance were you from the creature
about twenty yards sir
you fired at large hovering target at that distance and missed
yes er well didn fire while it was hovering sir
you mean you froze
no sir didn exactly freeze
what exactly were you doing
well was startled for second and then by the time fired the thing was already moving
do you have any further information
no sir
do you gentlemen have any further questions
only hesitated for moment sir sorry
ensign you re relieved of all duties and confined to quarters until further notice
yes sir leaves
you were little hard on the boy jim
he froze one man was killed another may die
captain scientifically
you ll both be filing reports make your comments and recommendations then
captain while we re waiting ve taken the liberty of cleaning the radioactive disposal vent on number two impulse engine but we ll be ready to leave orbit in under half an hour
we re not leaving orbit mister scott not that quickly
captain the yorktown requesting information on how soon we expect to rendezvous with them
thank you
the medicine for theta seven colony is not only needed desperately and has limited
aware of the situation engineer and getting little tired of my senior officers conspiring against me forgive me perhaps shouldn have used the word conspire
agreed sir
scanner readings
nothing sir continuing to scan
are you aware it can change its molecular structure
yes sir
are you scanning for any unusual movement
yes sir
any type of gaseous cloud
we ve run full scanner probe twice
then run it twenty times if that what it takes
hope not disturbing you doctor
interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance mister spock it relief
need your advice
then need drink
do not understand your reasoning
you need advice from me you must be kidding
do not joke doctor perhaps should rephrase my statement require an opinion there are many aspects of human irrationality do not yet comprehend obsession for one the persistent single-minded fixation on one idea
jim and his creature
precisely have you studied the incident involving the uss farragut
no with all these deaths and injuries ve only had chance to scan the tapes there are eight or ten hours of record tape there
fortunately read somewhat faster in brief doctor nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated the captain name was garrovick
the same as our ensign
his father among the survivors was young officer on his first deep-space assignment james kirk and there is still more suggest you study this spock hands over record tape the captain is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling jeopardise my crew my ship for feeling can even put into words no man achieves starfleet command without relying on intuition but have made rational decision am letting the horrors of the past distort my judgment of the present
mind if come in kirk gets up and goes to his desk
kirk to bridge scanning report
maintain search kirk out it can have just vanished
sometimes they do if we re lucky monsters come in many forms you know the greatest monster of them all jim guilt
get to the point
jim when young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time he under tremendous emotional stress now we all know that
ensign garrovick is ship-command decision you re straying out of your field doctor he returns to his bed
am was speaking of lieutenant james kirk of the starship farragut eleven years ago you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked according to the tapes this young lieutenant kirk insisted upon blaming himself
because delayed in firing at it
you had normal emotion you were startled you delayed firing for grand total of perhaps two seconds
if hadn delayed it would have been killed
the ship exec didn seem to think so his log entry was quite clear on the subject lieutenant kirk is fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery
don you understand it killed two hundred crewmen
captain garrovick was very important to you wasn he jim
yes he was my commanding officer from the day left the academy one of the finest men ever knew could have killed that thing if fired soon enough the first time
you don know that jim you don know that any more than you know that garrovick could have destroyed it
can help how feel there an intelligence about it bones malevolence it evil it must be destroyed
to be so obsessed
obsessed
that you could destroy yourself your career young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago
don push our friendship past the point where have to take official
not jim this is professional captain am preparing medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of starship captain which requires witness of command grade mccoy goes to the door and opens it to admit spock
do take it doctor commander that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated
correctly phrased captain as recommended in the manual our reply also as recommended is sir we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items which on the surface seem unusual we respectfully ask permission to inquire further
blast it forget the manual ask your questions
sir the uss yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point it carries perishable drugs
skip the recitation spock know the facts
they need those vaccines on theta seven captain now why are we delaying here
because convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the farragut eleven years ago
creature captain
my report is on the tapes as it attacked us eleven years ago as lost consciousness could feel the intelligence of the thing could sense it thinking planning
you say you could sense its intelligence captain how did it communicate with you
you state that it happened just as you lost consciousness semiconscious mind is very tricky thing man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination
whatever it is doctor whatever it is wouldn you call it deadly
yes there no doubt about that
and what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years ago from planet over thousand light years from here
obviously captain if it is an intelligent creature if it is the same one if it therefore is capable of space travel it could pose great threat to inhabited planets
lot of ifs agree but in my command judgment they out weigh other factors intuition however illogical mister spock is recognized as command prerogative
jim we re not trying to gang up on you
and you haven doctor you ve expressed the proper concern you ve asked the proper questions you ve both done your duty now may ask what medical log entry you intend to make
at this point my medical log remains open
in that case gentlemen
kirk here
have reading on the whatever it is captain leaving the planet surface heading into space
all decks red alert red alert prepare to leave orbit
captain we can maintain warp eight speed much longer pressures are approaching the critical point
range mister chekov it sir
we are barely closing in on it captain we could be pursuing it for days
if necessary do what you can to increase our speed scott
aye sir
extreme magnification mister chekov
magnification twelve there sir got it
spock how do you read that
conflicting data captain it seems to be in borderline state between matter and energy elements of both it could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion
and you don find that sophisticated mister spock
extremely efficient captain whether that indicates intelligence is another matter
open hatch on impulse engine number two mister scott was doing an aid clean-up on it
we won be using the impulse engines turn the alarm off
aye sir
captain we can do it if we keep this speed we ll blow up any minute now scott looks frantic spock almost concerned everyone else is worried kirk looks as if he might burst into tears of frustration
go to warp six
hi everyone else is at alert station so brought you some dinner
not hungry
doctor orders
what happening
are we still chasing that thing half way across the galaxy yes has the captain lost his sense of balance maybe is the entire crew about ready to explode positively you re lucky you re out of it
what do you mean out of it caused it you know that too don you if fired my phaser quickly enough on argus ten this wouldn have happened
you know self-pity terrible first course why don you try the soup instead
told you christine not hungry
doctor mccoy thought you might say something like that this is his officially logged prescription for you it has one word on it eat now if you don follow his orders doctor mccoy could and possibly would have you hauled down to sickbay and fed intravenously she leaves carrying the record tape chapel puts the record tape in mccoy in-tray
what that
hmm picks up the tape again this
reading survey on cygnian respiratory diseases thought you took garrovick some food what were you doing with this
applying psychology
the creature is slowing it down to warp two
reduce speed approach slowly
don understand it was outrunning us
maybe it decided to fight phasers ready
phasers show ready sir garrovick takes the lid off his meal and throws it across the room it knocks the switch on his ventilation filter to bypass drill all decks to battle stations garrovick dashes out into the corridor
it coming to full halt sir magnification one
move in closely mister chekov sublight one quarter speed
captain request permission to return to my post he is totally ignored
within phaser range sir
lock all phasers on target
locked on target
fire phasers mister chekov the beams of deadly light go straight through the cloud
phasers ineffectual sir
photon torpedoes minimum spread pattern
minimum pattern ready sir
fire photon torpedoes the ship is rocked by the blasts at such close quarters
there it coming sir
deflectors up
deflectors up sir
the deflectors will not stop it captain
that impossible
should have surmised this for the creature to be able to use gravity as propulsive force it would have to have this capacity
five seconds to contact all hatches and vents secure all lights on the board show green sir the number two impulse vent we have red light
over chekov speech lieutenant uhura all decks rest of speech lost under chekov increasing volume
captain something entered through the number two impulse vent
negative pressure in all ship vents alert all decks
report
when it entered impulse engine number two vent it attacked two crewmen it then got into the ventilating system and now we have air for only two hours
bones
one man has chance for survival the other is dead you can add that little price tag to your monster hunt
that enough bones
it not enough you didn care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall well it not on it captain it in it
may suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature the matter has now been rendered academic the creature is now after us
creature mister spock
it turned and attacked doctor its method was well-considered and intelligent
yes well it could have been many light years away from us instead it chose to turn and attack here why
impossible to tell captain until can make closer survey of the creature
scotty try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation system see what effect that has
aye leaves
sorry jim was wrong leaves
captain the creature ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits there is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination if you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago captain garrovick would still be dead the fault was not yours jim in fact there was no fault
if you want to play analyst spock use someone else not me my concern is with the ship and the crew
come in
ensign am correct in my assumption that you ve been disturbed by what you consider to be failure on your part nod would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species when suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger the human will experience split second of indecision he hesitates do have your attention ensign
yes sir
know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than
mister spock it very kind of you to come here
kindness mr garrovick is another human emotion and believe we have enough of that simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio suddenly stops and sniffs do you smell something
sir it coming through the vent
get out of here ll attempt to seal it off spock literally throws garrovick out into the corridor he then goes to the vent but the damaged switch breaks off in his hand
into intercom sir the creature in my cabin it got mister spock
on my way garrovick security to three four one medical alert scotty reverse cabin pressure three four one he does so and the gas is sucked back into the vent
security hold it tricorder
jim spock may be dying
if we let that thing into the ship he ll have lot of company
must have jammed the vent control when hit it
see if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the ventilation system
he saved my life captain should be lying dead in there not him the cabin door opens
fortunately neither of us is dead ensign the reverse pressure worked the vent is closed
don misunderstand my next question mister spock why aren you dead
it that green blood of his
my haemoglobin is based on copper not iron
ll bet he left bad taste in the creature mouth too
colloquially expressed but essentially correct
yes the scent is different think understand something now
do you believe you re in communication with the creature
don know what it is mister spock but you remember said the thing was alive it may not be communication as we understand it but did know it was alive and intelligent and think know something else now
kirk here number two impulse vent the radioactive flushing may be affecting it
open the vent on my way to the bridge kirk out ensign garrovick
yes sir
you were on the bridge when we were attacked
yes sorry sir know was confined to quarters but when the alert sounded
very commendable ensign what was your impression of the battle
don understand sir
asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used against the creature
ineffective captain realise captain you did everything you could do know that it just that nothing works against monster that can do the things that thing does
and ensign what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet
delayed firing
if you hadn delayed firing no difference ensign no weapon known would have made any difference then or eleven years ago report for duty ensign
yes captain thank you sir
report mister chekov
results positive captain the creature has left the ship at high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range the way that thing can move captain wouldn believe it
direction mister spock
it was bearing one two seven mark nine but ve lost it now
into intercom mister scott ll need all the speed you can deliver keep at it until we begin to shake apart kirk out believe know where it going
it has changed course before to mislead us captain logic would dictate that
no playing intuition mister chekov compute course for tychos star system
computed and on the board
ahead full
ahead full sir
lieutenant uhura contact starfleet and the uss yorktown
frequency open and clear sir
inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of that system that the location of its attack on the uss farragut eleven years ago
do not understand captain
in garrovick quarters said the scent of the creature was somehow different something in my mind said home
and you know where home is captain
yes think do don know how know but home is where it fought starship once before ito uhura inform them of our tactical situation and inform them committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature we will rendezvous round-trip time mister chekov
one point seven days sir
we will rendezvous with the uss yorktown in forty eight hours later
assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it
precisely
you don agree with mister spock
it the time factor that bothers me those drugs are perishable
doctor evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn if so it will reproduce by fission not just into two parts but thousands
antimatter seems our only possibility
an ounce should be sufficient we can drain it from the ship engines and transport it to the planet surface in magnetic vacuum field
contact medical stores want as much haemoplasm as they can spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes
yes sir
presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature
we must get it to the antimatter it seems attracted to red blood cells what better bait could we have
there is still one problem captain
the blast yes
exactly matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet atmosphere if our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves
chance we ll have to take mister spock
also we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions if man is beaming up when that hits we may lose him
that exactly why ve decided to set the trap myself
captain there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood the creature could not harm me extensively it therefore seems logical for me to be the one
negative mister spock in case this plan fails ll need you aboard the ship in that event we ll need another plan
it will require two men to transport the antimatter unit
like permission to go with you sir
had you in mind mister garrovick kirk garrovick and blue ball under floating carrying device beam down
kirk to enterprise
proceed immediately to maximum orbit
just think captain less than one ounce of antimatter here is more powerful than ten thousand cobalt bombs
let hope it as powerful as man will ever get detonator
aye sir he primes and sets it on the anti-grav unit
kirk to enterprise
spock here captain holding at thirty thousand kilometres
antimatter container positioned and armed ll call you back when it baited kirk out
captain look the cloud is already over the bottle of blood within moments it is empty
the haemoplasm the bait already taken
we ll need something else for bait
sir that thing only feeds on blood
garrovick get back to the ship tell them to prepare to detonate
captain you re not going to be the bait
said get back to the ship ensign gave you an order
yes sir quick karate chop knocks kirk down but not out he lands couple of punches on garrovick
consider yourself on report this is no time for heroics have no intention of sacrificing myself at least not yet into communicator spock spock
scan us and lock on to us it going to be close very very close stand by stand by enterprise the cloud approaches
can smell it captain it sickening honey sweet
stand by enterprise the cloud reaches them now energise and detonate bang spock and scott are at the controls with mccoy watching
reset energise the ship is shaken and still nothing appears on the transporter pad
do something
we are doctor cross-circuiting to
got them piece of them anyway
cross-circuiting to
crazy way to travel spreading man molecules all over the universe finally the swirly bits solidify into two men
captain thank heaven
mister scott there was no deity involved it was my cross-circuiting to that recovered them
well then thank pitchforks and pointed ears as long as it worked jim
that fair statement bones now that the creature is dead let save some lives we ll deliver your medicine bridge this is kirk
have mister chekov lay in course for rendezvous with the yorktown maximum warp
oh ensign meet me in my quarters when you ve cleaned up like to talk to you about your father several tall stories think you like to hear
thank you sir would
any response from the malurians lieutenant
nothing since their original distress call sir
what about the federation science team working there doctor manway had special transmitter
there nothing sir scanning all frequencies
they have to answer
captain they will not answer the long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life
that can be the last census reported total inhabitation of more than four billion people
register no life readings at all sir
that impossible what could have happened
we would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe and in the event of an interplanetary war there would be considerable radioactive residue our instruments show only normal background radiation
any other possibilities
unknown sir sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms they do not in addition we received the routine report from this system only week ago even the symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly
captain shields just snapped on something heading in at multiwarp speeds
evasive manoeuvres mister sulu
an extremely powerful bolt of energy captain
full power to the shields mister scott
giving them all we got
all hands red alert phaser banks stand by photon torpedoes to condition red condition red the viewscreen fills with ball of bright light
it going to hit everyone gets thrown around lot and the lights go out for short while
shields still holding sir
good
temporarily captain our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes
ninety
may add the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent
first attack sir
think we can expect others lieutenant
we can resist three more such attacks the fourth will shatter our shields completely
mister spock pinpoint the source mister sulu evasive manoeuvres
aye sir
lieutenant contact starfleet command patch in my log tell them what has happened tell them the entire malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency and that we are under attack by an unidentified force another ball of light is on the viewscreen
helmsmen said evasive manoeuvres
we re losing power sir
scotty
having to divert the warp engine power into the shields sir if you want the protection
mister spock speed of those bolts
approximately warp fifteen captain
then we can out run them good scotty you re doing the right thing another hit source spock
unknown captain nothing within sensor range third bolt approaching something now captain very small bearing one two three degrees mark one eight range ninety thousand kilometres
that our target mister sulu prepare photon torpedo the third bolt hits
shields still holding sir but the drain on the engines is reaching the critical point ach we lost warp manoeuvreing power switching to impulse
photon torpedoes armed sir
has the target changed location mister spock
no sir holding steady
ready photon torpedo number two mister sulu
ready sir
fire
torpedo away pause then flash direct hit
no effect target absorbed full energy of our torpedo
absorbed it there must be damage to your instruments spock
they are in good working order captain
but what could have absorbed that much energy and survived lieutenant try to make contact
aye sir
sir they ve fired another
can we take it mister scott
that problematical sir it hits
captain shields are down we cannot survive another hit
anything lieutenant
trying sir
translator computer all hailing frequencies open
aye sir all hailing frequencies open
to unidentified vessel this is captain james kirk of the uss enterprise we are on peaceful mission we mean no harm to you or any lifeforms please communicate with us any further readings mister spock
computing now captain weight five hundred kilograms shape roughly cylindrical length fraction over one metre
five hundred kilos and only one metre long
what kind of intelligent creatures can exist in thing that small
intelligence does not necessarily require bulk mister scott
captain we re getting signal from the spacecraft
put it on audio lieutenant
yes sir it impossible to get it any clearer sir
analysis sector have them study and decode it
analysis sector channel one main computer decode
captain this message is sort of binary extremely sophisticated compressed carrying several channels at once
can you decode it
no clue as yet captain moment transmission speed has stepped down much slower seems to be single binary
it mathematical yes one symbol the symbol repeat sir that isn in the starfleet code it an old-style interplanetary code
fascinating
repeat what the message sent
it would seem so captain
this is captain james kirk of the uss enterprise we are on peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy we have no hostile intentions we request identity
it another signal now sir
it formula captain they re sending us mathematical message and requesting language equivalence they re trying to communicate
tie in the ship translator to the communication channel let them take it at their own speed
aye captain suddenly one of spock console monitor burns out
cut power lieutenant overloaded and burned out
guess they can take it faster than we give it
captain the message is coming in now
apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out
nomad
it is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential
we are prepared to beam you aboard our ship
do you require any special conditions any particular atmosphere or environment
good hold your position we re locked onto your co-ordinates we ll beam you aboard
captain you re not really bringing that thing in here
do we have any choice scotty besides once it aboard it won be taking any more shots at us lieutenant get repair crew on that computer get doctor mccoy down to the transporter room spock you come with me scotty you too
doctor mccoy to the transporter room maintenance crew c5
they ve got the co-ordinates jim it locked in
energise
energising what looks like satellite antenna at the top engine at the bottom and flashing lights on the side is hanging in mid air over the transporter pad
sensor readings mister spock
negative captain it has protective screen cannot get through
what do we do now go up and knock
relate your point of origin
we are from the united federation of planets
insufficient response all things have point of origin will scan your star charts
if we show it close-up view of our system it has no point of reference it won know more than it does now
reasonable course
if you care to leave your ship we ll provide the necessary life support systems
non sequitur your facts are uncoordinated
jim don think anybody in there
contain no parasitical beings am nomad
in my opinion that machine
it is reacting much like highly sophisticated computer
am nomad what is opinion
an opinion is belief view judgment
insufficient response
what your source of power
it has changed since the point of origin there was much taken from the other am perpetual now am nomad
wasn there probe called nomad launched in the early 2000s
yes it was reported destroyed there were no more in the series but if this is that probe
will scan your star charts
will bring them
have the capability of movement within your ship
this way nomad glides along slowly in mid-air
now scotty get our warp power up to full capacity
aye sir
spock bones come with us bemused young indian officer watches the performance
chart 14a sir
14a diagram of our solar system comes up on screen nomad can you scan that
yes
this is our point of origin the star we know as sol
you are from the third planet
yes
planet with one large natural satellite
yes
the planet is called earth
yes
you are the creator the kirk the sterilisation procedure against your ship was unnecessary
what sterilisation procedure
you are the kirk the creator you programmed my function
well not the kirk tell me what your function is
this is one of your units creator
yes he is
it functions irrationally
sometimes but tell him your function nevertheless
my function is to probe for biological infestations to destroy that which is not perfect am nomad
biological infestation there was never any probe sent out for that
believe the history computer can answer that question ll have the readout in moment
did you destroy the malurian system
not the system creator kirk only the unstable biological infestation it is my function
unstable infestation the population of four planets what kind of function
doctor why do you call me the creator
is the usage incorrect
well
the usage is correct the creator was simply testing your memory banks
there was much damage in the accident
mister singh come here moment this unit will see to your needs
sir
ll be back in moment gentlemen come with me kirk mccoy and spock leave singh still bemused
you re on to something spock what is it
ve correlated all the available information on the nomad probe and convinced that this object is indeed that probe
ridiculous earth science couldn begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago
true
nomad was destroyed
presumed destroyed by meteor collision submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself
heard some lectures at the academy on the nomad probe its mission was essentially peaceful nomad is quietly ticking to itself then suddenly light comes on at its apex
did disturb you did you wish anything
lieutenant singh here power indicators
mister scott engineers are working on them now uhura: report to him when your indicators are registering properly
one moment lieutenant heart is where my heart is somewhere beyond the stars beyond antares nomad leaves the room
this is the creator of nomad perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time his dream was to build perfect thinking machine capable of independent logic you recall his name
of course jackson roykirk
jackson roykirk captain james kirk
yes similar captain believe that nomad thinks you are roykirk that may well be why the attack was broken off it responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted
what do we have on nomad itself spock
looking at the schematic on the monitor that not the same
essentially it is doctor believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision it mentioned the other the unanswered question is the other what nomad was thinking machine the best that could be engineered it was prototype
its purpose was certainly altered its directive to seek out and destroy biological infestations could not have been programmed into it
as recall it wasn it was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms
precisely doctor and somehow that programming has been changed it would seem that nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms perfection being measured by its own relentless logic
if what you say is true then we ve taken aboard our vessel device which sooner or later must destroy us security
this is the captain the mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room have security team meet me there in five minutes
aye sir acknowledge
captain mister singh reports that nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room
security cancel that order implement full search for the mechanism all decks report to me here the turbolift doors open and nomad floats out one antenna extended uhura is still singing
where my heart is where scented miracle
whispering bridge to captain
that mechanical beastie is up here
on my way scotty nomad retracts its antenna and takes the most direct path to uhura who is leaning against the navigation station sulu has to move out of its way
tomorrow the path along the way there where my love
what is the meaning
what
what form of communication
don know what it realises oh my singing was singing
for what purpose is singing
don know like to sing felt like music
what is music ray of light envelopes her head think about music
lieutenant keep away from that
scotty blast of energy sends scott flying backwards into bulkhead
bones
he dead jim
why did you kill him
the unit touched my screens
that unit was my chief engineer silence lieutenant lieutenant are you all right uhura just gazes blankly ahead
sickbay what did you do to her
that unit is defective its thinking is chaotic absorbing it unsettled me
that unit is woman
mass of conflicting impulses
get scott down below
will the creator effect repairs on the unit scott
he dead
insufficient response
his biological functions have ceased
does the creator wish me to repair the unit
there nothing can do jim if there chance it ll have to be soon
all right nomad repair the unit
require tapes on the structure
well he ll need tapes on general anatomy the central nervous system and then one on the physiological structure of the brain we better give it all the neurological studies we have as well as tracings of scotty hyperencephalogram spock loads up the data
nomad have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer please do not draw the information faster than the machine capacity
proceed few moments later creator the unit scott is primitive structure insufficient safeguards built in breakdown can occur from many causes self-maintenance systems of low reliability
it serves me as it is nomad repair it
where is the unit scott now
the body is in sickbay
show me sickbay
doctor mccoy will show you mccoy and nomad enter the turbolift
security want twenty four hour two man armed surveillance on nomad pick it up in sickbay nomad and mccoy are standing by the biobed with scott body on it and chapel is scanning it kirk and spock enter
no reaction doctor
could have told you that without looking suddenly heart beat and the indicators rise into the green area
what are the lot of you staring at me for
it unbelievable
fascinating
how did get here how did sees nomad
it all right
that thing did something to lieutenant uhura
scotty she being taken care of it all right
take it easy lie down scotty we just want to check you out
the unit scott is repaired it will function correctly if your information to me was correct
like to check it out if you don mind man is not just biological unit that you can patch together
what did it do to me
doctor mccoy will explain it to you
well doctor
nurse want him prepared for full physical examination
yes sir
nomad come here they all go to the doorway to the medical bay uhura is in bed still staring blankly
repair that unit
not possible
you restored scott he had much more extensive damage
the unit scott required simple structural repair the knowledge banks of this unit have been wiped clean
captain if that is correct if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased she could be re-educated
bones
yes ll get on it right away oh and in spite of the way you repaired scotty you metal ticking
does the creator wish nomad to wait elsewhere
yes nomad you will go with these units the two red-shirts they will take you to waiting area take it to the top security cell nomad and its escort leave
doctor interrupted you because nomad would not have understood your anger it has great technical skill but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable it almost qualifies as life-form
that laugh
the study of it would be of great use captain
it killer spock intend to render it harmless get down to the brig run full analysis on the mechanism want to know what makes that thing tick spock; yes sir spock is sitting with arms crossed as nomad floats in front of him
what the problem
an almost human stubbornness captain have been unable to convince nomad to lower its screens for analysis without its co-operation can do nothing
nomad you will allow mister spock to probe your memory banks and structure
mister spock is also one of your biological units creator
yes
this unit is different it is well-ordered
follow your instructions nomad
my screens are down
thank you
you may proceed uhura is sitting up in bed and reading from monitor
see the dog see the dog
sound it out
run
that it uhura that very good now try the next one
the dog has the dog something
not swahili uhura in english the dog has ball see ah ll ball now you go ahead
swahili then the dog has ball
that right oh that right uhura they hug then mccoy beckons chapel over oh here you try another one ll be right back
all right christine
how she doing
well she on the first grade reader she learning seems to have an aptitude for mathematics do you think we can re-educate her doctor
well she checks out with no brain damage we ve got all the educational tapes in our library now it up to us
the ball is bl-u-ee bl-u-ey bluey
it is not sufficient captain get certain references to the accident the other but nothing clear there are areas simply cannot scan
we ve got to know about it spock what makes it operate its compulsion for perfection
captain suggest the vulcan mind probe
get into direct mental contact with that thing
it seems the only way
you saw what it did to uhura
there is risk but have formed partial hypothesis must check it out
nomad the unit spock will touch you it is not an attack it is form of communication you will permit it
will permit it creator spock puts one hand on nomad head where the antenna are and the other on its body where the lights and ticking are coming from
am nomad am performing my function deep emptiness it approaches collision damage blackness am the other am tan ru tan ru nomad tan ru error flaw imperfection must sterilise rebirth we are complete much power gun ta noo icka tan ru the creator instructs search out identify sterilise imperfections we are nomad we are nomad we are complete we are instructed our purpose is clear sterilise imperfections he lets go of nomad sterilise imperfections nomad sterilise sterilise nomad sterilise
spock spock nomad you re in contact with the unit spock stop stop
acknowledged spock slumps in kirk arms and is rushed out of the brig the guard activates the security forcefield
spock spock
fascinating captain the knowledge the depth
what does it mean we are nomad
it was it was damaged in deep space undoubtedly the meteor collision its memory banks were destroyed or most of them it wandered without purpose and then it met the other the other was an alien probe of great power somehow they merged repaired each other became one
then it isn nomad
not the nomad we lost from earth it took from the other new directive to replace its own the other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets probably as prelude to colonisation
changeling
beg your pardon
an ancient earth legend mister spock changeling was fairy child that was left in place of human baby the changeling assumed the identity of the human child so it is to sterilise and for sterilise read kill spock and it has the power and sophistication to do it
yes it powerful it sophisticated but it not infallible it space-happy it thinks its mother
and that is the only thing that has saved us until now yes they leave nomad flies through the forcefield the two guards fire their phasers at it but it screens are back up nomad zaps them into oblivion nomad floats in
notify the captain what are you doing here watch your panels everyone watch that polymass roger help with the interfactor leave that alone
this primitive matter-antimatter propulsion system is the main drive
aye
inefficiency exists in the antimatter input valve will effect repair the indicator board goes crazy
how are you doing that
the energy release controls are also most inefficient shall effect repair
warp eight mister scott and increasing
throw your dampers
warp nine
cut your circuits all of them
warp 10 mister scott
impossible it can go that fast
it just won stop mister scott warp eleven
nomad stop what you re doing scotty
is there problem creator have increased engine efficiency fifty seven percent
you will destroy my ship its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power turn off your repair operation
acknowledged it is reversed as ordered creator
mister scott give sulu warp two and keep her there
aye sir spock enters leaving two guards outside
captain ve examined the brig the forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished must assume they are dead
you killed two of my
creator your biological units are inefficient
nomad it about time told you who and what you are biological unit and created you
pause non sequitur biological units are inherently inferior this is an inconsistency
nomad there are two men waiting outside you will not harm them they will escort you back to the waiting area you will stay there you will do nothing
am programmed to investigate
have given you new programming and you will implement it
there is much to be considered before return to launch point must re-evaluate nomad follows the guards down the corridor away from engineering
reevaluate
suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator captain it may have been unwise to admit to nomad that you are biological unit in nomad eyes you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect
it was foolish mistake
even worse nomad just now made reference to its launch point earth
spock do you think it possible that it got fix on earth when it tapped the computers earlier
do not believe there is much beyond nomad capabilities
and we ve shown it the way home and when it gets there
it will find the earth infested with imperfect biological units
and it will carry out its prime directive sterilise captain log stardate 3541 the presence of nomad aboard my ship has become nightmarish now it apparently means to return to earth once there it would automatically destroy all life the guards who are now behind nomad turn right nomad goes straight on
hey nomad stop nomad this way they fire at it and the inevitable follows strike two more red-shirts nomad uses the access tubes between decks instead of the turbolift in another corridor kirk and spock run to door labeled leonard mccoy md but it does not open automatically for them
manual controls
no response the doors open and nomad comes out
nomad nomad stop nomad stop nomad mccoy is cradling chapel in his arms
is she all right
think so looks like some kind of shock
what happened
nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories she tried to stop him
whose history
yours
since it specifically examined your history suggest it has completed its re-evaluation
and found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units
kirk here
manual override has been blocked source engineering
nomad
undoubtedly
jim with all the systems out we ll only have enough air and heat for
get scotty some antigravs and meet me in engineering everyone appears to be unconscious as kirk runs in alone
nomad stop what you re doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems
stop
you re programmed to obey the orders of your creator
am programmed to destroy those life-forms which are imperfect these alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which surrounds them it too is imperfect but can be adjusted
nomad admit that biological units are imperfect but biological unit created you
am perfect am nomad
no you re not nomad you re an alien machine your programming tapes have been altered
you are in error you are biological unit you are imperfect
but am your creator
you are the creator
created you
you are the creator
but admit imperfect how could have created such perfect thing as you
answer unknown shall analyse spock enters with scott two engineers and the requested anti-grav units
analysis complete insufficient data to resolve problem but my programming is whole my purpose remains am nomad am perfect that which is imperfect must be sterilised the engineers remove the unconscious men and take their places at the controls
then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect
shall continue shall return to launch point earth shall sterilise
you must sterilise in case of error
error is inconsistent with my prime functions sterilisation is correction
everything that is in error must be sterilised
there are no exceptions
nomad made an error in creating you
the creation of perfection is no error
did not create perfection created error
your data is faulty am nomad am perfect
am the kirk the creator
you are the creator
you are wrong jackson roykirk your creator is dead you have mistaken me for him you are in error you did not discover your mistake you have made two errors you are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation you have made three errors
error error error examine
you are flawed and imperfect execute your prime function
shall analyse error analyse error
now get those antigravs on it
examine error error the anti-gravs are not stopped by any forcefields
we ve got to get rid of it while it trying to think
your logic was impeccable captain we are in grave danger
scotty the transporter room
analyse error kirk and spock carry nomad out followed by scott
error
scotty set the controls for deep space two ten mark one
aye sir
faulty ready sir
faulty
nomad you are imperfect
error error
exercise your prime function
faulty faulty must sterilise sterilise
now
energising they observe the satisfying explosion on monitor
my congratulations captain dazzling display of logic
you didn think had it in me did you spock
no sir
thought you might like to know that lieutenant uhura is back to college level she ll be back on the job within week
good bones good
remarkable
what
the destruction of nomad was great waste captain it was remarkable instrument
which might well have destroyed more billions of lives it well gone besides what are you feeling so badly about it not easy to lose bright and promising son
sir
well it thought was its mother didn it do you think completely without feelings mister spock you saw what it did for scotty what doctor it would ve made my son the doctor kind of gets you right there doesn it
