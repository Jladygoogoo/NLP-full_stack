"Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock, second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson. ",KIRK
What were you saying? ,SPOCK
They do have one redeeming characteristic. ,SPOCK
Charlie's a seventeen year old boy. ,KIRK
"Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Where's the captain, Spock? We were right behind him.",MCCOY
"True, his body was never found. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Captain? ",MCCOY
"There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was true. ",KIRK
Spock. He must've got my message. ,KIRK
"Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Come in! ",KIRK
"Aircraft is breaking up, Captain. ",SPOCK
The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now. Are you standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him? ,SPOCK
"You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot  SPOCK: Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine. ",MCCOY
Then my equipment should be there. ,MCCOY
"Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult. ",SPOCK
"His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control? ",SPOCK
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this? ",SPOCK
They're children. ,KIRK
"Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this planet, Captain.",SPOCK
Did they leave any other books? ,KIRK
Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised. ,SPOCK
Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes. ,SPOCK
I shall do so. ,SPOCK
"Meet Kol-Tai, Mister Scott. A friend of Doctor McCoy's. ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry. ",SPOCK
I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will either. ,KIRK
"I'll accompany you, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant M'Ress, all shore leaves are cancelled until further notice. Mister Arex, you have the conn. Investigating landing party will consist of Spock, Sulu, McCoy and myself. ",KIRK
"Spock, what is the logic in letting a man die for the sake of creating his duplicate? Explain it to me, sir. Explain it to me. ",KIRK
The Colonel is drunk. He's had a little too much to drink. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, pass the word by sections. Shore leave is to commence immediately. ",KIRK
Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? ,KIRK
"Of course. Our Federation scientists were more correct than they realised. In order to function, the galactic creation point must extend through space, time, into another dimension where the logic of things is totally different. ",SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. Argh! (machine to maximum) Kirk to Enterprise. Argh!,KIRK
"It doesn't matter, Bones. ",KIRK
"It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine. ",MCCOY
"Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath. Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions. ",MCCOY
Where? ,KIRK
Would you mind explaining (she kisses him) Who are you? ,KIRK
Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party.,MCCOY
Well? ,KIRK
"Reading, Spock? ",KIRK
"Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down.",SPOCK
"Jim, she may not remember or even really know. Disassociation could be complete. It doesn't seem possible she could have performed surgery on Spock. ",MCCOY
"Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left? ",KIRK
"Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision. ",SPOCK
I said dig! ,KIRK
"Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"The Treaty of Sirius does not permit them any weapons at all, beyond police vessels. Obviously, the treaty has been broken. ",SPOCK
Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its technical translation is cave dweller. ,SPOCK
My crew. ,KIRK
"Jim, if the others are lost, why take the risk? ",MCCOY
"Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose. ",KIRK
I demand an explanation for this unprovoked attack. ,KIRK
Gentlemen. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I'm here. You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you and the others. ",KIRK
The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks. ,SPOCK
Using Code two. ,SPOCK
"At present, yes. (his tricorder beeps) Odd. ",SPOCK
At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My hobby. ,SPOCK
There would seem to be evidence to that effect. ,SPOCK
"Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship. ",KIRK
I won't submit to this petty search for revenge! ,KIRK
"You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature?",KIRK
"I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject. ",SPOCK
"Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant. ",KIRK
Now. ,SPOCK
"As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours. ",SPOCK
Spurn him. Reject him. You must. You're special to him. ,KIRK
These men are friends. To force them to fight until one of them is killed  T'PAU: I can forgive such a display only once. Challenge was given and lawfully accepted. It has begun. Let no one interfere. ,MCCOY
"Fascinating. Mechanical manifestations, of course. Was anyone considering the subject of pterodactyls? ",SPOCK
Meaning we can outrun them? ,KIRK
"In the family, all is silence. No more will be said of it. Live long and prosper, Sarek of Vulcan. ",SPOCK
Jamie. ,KIRK
"I suffer the same affliction as you, sir. ",SPOCK
"No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk. ",KIRK
"It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way. ",SPOCK
What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead. ,MCCOY
I couldn't. ,KIRK
The computer tie-in. You spoke to it before. It knows you. ,KIRK
M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder. ,SPOCK
"But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better officer in return.",KIRK
"I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too disciplined once you've made up your mind. But Doctor McCoy has a plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft. You may not tell me what I want to know, but he will. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant, sound alert. ",KIRK
I understand. ,SPOCK
"Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments. ",SPOCK
"I see. (pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we shall continue on our present course. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless it is your intention to declare a mutiny. ",SPOCK
"(with a medical scanner) If the lock is magnetised, this may disrupt its field. ",SPOCK
Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned? ,KIRK
"Negative. Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us here.",SPOCK
This must be a space first. A transport ship that doesn't need anything? ,KIRK
"Hmm. If we connect our two communicators in series, we can give off a high energy burst which might work, but it will also render the communicators powerless in a very short time. ",SPOCK
The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon. ,SPOCK
"A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system.",SPOCK
What are their demands? ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. ,KIRK
"Professor Crater? Professor? Mrs. Crater? Nervous, Dr. McCoy? ",KIRK
"Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world. ",KIRK
"You realise that within forty five minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere? ",KIRK
"Activated, Captain. ",SPOCK
Yes. The terror of murder. The suspense. The fun. ,KIRK
"What are you offering me, Jan? Love, or a going away present?",KIRK
The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you being stoned? ,SPOCK
"Let's try it, and let's be close to the communicator when we do.",KIRK
Mister Cochrane. We were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn't identify. ,KIRK
"I don't mean that. I'm getting a Red Alert right here. (the back of his head) That thing is dangerous. I feel. (hesitates) Only a fool would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress. You have my psychological profiles. Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer? ",KIRK
"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course.",SPOCK
"Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five, eight six. She'll blow soon!",SPOCK
"Offhand, I'd say we learned to keep our hands off. ",KIRK
"The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it. ",SPOCK
I'll let you know. ,MCCOY
Where does the trail lead to? ,KIRK
"Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate? ",SPOCK
Comments? ,KIRK
"I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I can't remember. ",KIRK
How are they?,KIRK
"No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us. We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action. Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap? ",KIRK
Commodore Stocker. ,SPOCK
"Aurora, cut power. You are overtaxing your ship. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant, relay our position and circumstances to Starbase Twelve immediately. ",KIRK
"Crewman, report to the lab!",SPOCK
"Exactly. McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood. ",KIRK
"A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to protect her.",MCCOY
"When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans will be stopped here. ",SPOCK
"Spock, prepare to fire phasers. ",KIRK
They're useless. ,MCCOY
Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of course you know that. Why? ,MCCOY
Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the planet. ,SPOCK
"Starfleet Control, repeating message. The Enterprise is home.",KIRK
That description is not scientifically accurate. ,SPOCK
It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet. She offered her life. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons. ",KIRK
"Yes, I'd say just about a sixteenth of an inch close. ",KIRK
"To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict. ",SPOCK
That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen. ,KIRK
"Yes, Commissioner? ",KIRK
"He looks drugged, Jim. Almost at a cataleptic state. ",MCCOY
"We'll ride her through, Bones. What else can we do? ",KIRK
"Spock, check out the shuttlecraft. Engine, communications, everything. ",KIRK
"Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point. ",SPOCK
Come in. ,MCCOY
"Radio tubes and so on. I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, lay in a direct course for Ratar Three. ",KIRK
"Don't worry. You'll be safe, darling. ",SPOCK
"No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return. ",KIRK
Yes. A slip of the tongue. ,KIRK
Get me Sickbay.,KIRK
That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter room.,SPOCK
Any word from the Enterprise?,SPOCK
"It's all right. It's in there. I guess I'll forget psychiatry, stick with surgery. I really thought she'd learned to want it. ",MCCOY
And the great misery which you now face. ,KIRK
"Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations.",SPOCK
"It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile. ",SPOCK
Hazards? ,KIRK
"We are on the surface, Mister Scott. Reprogram the transporter as previously directed. ",SPOCK
"Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors. ",SPOCK
"Only half. The other half is human. Far more human than you, apparently. ",KIRK
Temperature one hundred eleven degrees and rising. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I remember you. ",MCCOY
Jim! ,MCCOY
"No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job. ",KIRK
Spock to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
"It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system. ",KIRK
Screen on. ,KIRK
You do know him well? An old friend? ,KIRK
And if I refuse? ,KIRK
"Scotty, how much time is there? ",KIRK
"Work on it. We've got to contact the ship. Mea, I want you to give me a complete layout of this building complex. How do I get to the War Room? ",KIRK
Of course we blew it up. Deliberately. ,KIRK
Then it translates its findings into English. ,SPOCK
Come on. ,KIRK
"On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian.",SPOCK
I hope not. Scotty has an idea. ,MCCOY
Keep going. ,KIRK
"Yes, it's possible. ",MCCOY
Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders. ,SPOCK
I doubt it. Not in his present condition. ,MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, proceed on course to Makus Three. Ahead warp factor one. ",KIRK
"It's not enough! You didn't care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall. Well, it's not on it, Captain, it's in it.",MCCOY
Tell Spock it's time for another shot. ,MCCOY
You can talk plainer than that. ,KIRK
But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food. ,KIRK
"Sturgeon, transport a sample of the plant to Mister Spock. We'll check if it's actually the Borgia plant or something we don't understand. (Sturgeon leaves) You got that, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper. ",SPOCK
There should be no life on this planet. ,SPOCK
Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals. ,SPOCK
Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down there. ,SPOCK
"Spock, do you ever say anything straight out? ",MCCOY
Report on damage sustained in mock attack. ,KIRK
Where's McCoy? ,KIRK
"When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?",SPOCK
"Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
What word from the sensor section? ,KIRK
"No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound. ",KIRK
Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming? ,KIRK
How do you mean? ,MCCOY
"Yes. I'll get on it right away. Oh, and in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal ticking  SPOCK: Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere? ",MCCOY
We do pride ourselves on our logic. ,SPOCK
Could be a natural radio source newly energised by  SPOCK: Correction. One isolated word pattern detected. If you accept intersat code as still operative. ,KIRK
"You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far from all right. ",MCCOY
Collecting specimens.,MCCOY
This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system. ,KIRK
"If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly. ",KIRK
You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains. ,KIRK
"Deep Space Station K7 now within sensor range, Captain. ",SPOCK
Definitely a space vessel of some type. ,SPOCK
Committed to Tantalus colony when?,KIRK
"You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it. ",SPOCK
"An equally good possibility is that ship's personnel have contracted, and may be continuing to shrink. ",SPOCK
It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of this sector. ,SPOCK
"If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible. ",KIRK
"That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy? ",SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. Why are you launching a shuttlecraft? ,KIRK
Bridge. ,KIRK
"I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer. ",MCCOY
"Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure. ",SPOCK
But you are afraid. ,KIRK
Repair that unit. ,KIRK
We're busy. (quietly) Look after the girl. ,KIRK
"It is a very real threat. In two standard years, the existing Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors. ",SPOCK
"When transporter is energised, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads. ",SPOCK
"Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous creature. ",KIRK
Matt? Matt. ,KIRK
Speech centre. ,MCCOY
Yes. ,KIRK
"He was young, and inexperienced. ",KIRK
Feel that something else is necessary.,SPOCK
I've heard that word a lot lately. Perfect.,KIRK
"Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose  TRELANE: You still haven't learned. You have no choice. Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome. It's all so very easy. ",KIRK
"A kink in my back. (behind his back the Yeoman starts to massage it) That's it. A little higher, please. Push. Push hard. Dig it in there, Mister  (Spock steps forward and Kirk realises who is massaging his lower back)",KIRK
We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us? ,SPOCK
"What can I do for you, Jim? ",MCCOY
What? ,KIRK
They must apply to everyone or they mean nothing! Do you understand? ,KIRK
"In his present condition, I don't think it would make much difference. ",MCCOY
Stop! You'll hurt him. ,KIRK
Get him out of here.,KIRK
Nurse. ,MCCOY
"As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg forgiveness. ",SPOCK
We need him. Override the controls and shut those doors. ,KIRK
"Check it out, Bones. Send me an immediate report. ",KIRK
Acknowledged. Crater! (Kirk fires his phaser) ,SPOCK
"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim.",SPOCK
"Jim, that man is sick. Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job. ",MCCOY
Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot. ,MCCOY
Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.,KIRK
"Jim, I'm worried about Spock. He's just not acting normal. ",MCCOY
"It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full dress uniforms.",KIRK
"If you have Spock's mind, you'll know the Vulcan symbol called the IDIC. ",KIRK
"A different centre of the brain, you say? ",KIRK
Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place. I find it extremely interesting. ,SPOCK
Bones. Bones. You said something about a book. Where is it? ,KIRK
"Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony. ",KIRK
What are you? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester? ",KIRK
"God of war, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
This is the Captain. There's a phaser on overload in my quarters.,KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible. ,KIRK
"All right. All right. In the heart. In the head. I won't stay dead. Next time I'll do the same to you. I'll kill you. And it goes on, the good old game of war, pawn against pawn! Stopping the bad guys.",KIRK
Warp factor two. Bring us to course one four eight mark three. ,KIRK
"Small change occurring there, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion. ",SPOCK
"Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser two. ",SPOCK
I did not create perfection. I created error. ,KIRK
I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it? ,MCCOY
We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did. ,KIRK
And Spock is his son. ,KIRK
Come on. ,KIRK
"They're crying, Jim. I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see. ",MCCOY
The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic. ,SPOCK
"Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way. ",SPOCK
Animals in a zoo rarely do. ,SPOCK
"Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that. ",KIRK
I think not. Doctor McCoy. ,SPOCK
Any indication of where that would be? ,KIRK
"Well, you're the A and A officer, aren't you? Archaeology, anthropology, ancient civilisations. ",MCCOY
Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then. ,KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"The rules. If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be able to help  CLAUDIUS: We believe men should fight their own battles. Only the weak will die. My word as a Roman. Ready to order your men down, Captain? ",KIRK
"Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation  ENWRIGHT [OC]: The explanation is beaming aboard now, Captain. He may already be in your transporter room. ",KIRK
"We are attempting to end it, Doctor. By reason, preferably.",SPOCK
"I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison. ",KIRK
"Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move. ",SPOCK
"What's the matter, Bones, you getting a persecution complex?",KIRK
You're confusing the stars with heaven. ,KIRK
"Survival of the fittest, because their ancestors who survived had to have a superior resistance. Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars. Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, your descendants might develop a longer life, but I hardly think it's worth it. ",MCCOY
"To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available. Losira's. ",SPOCK
"Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard? ",KIRK
"Well, Doctor? ",SPOCK
One small thing was changed this time. A pet died. ,SPOCK
"I said you were excused, Nurse. Please, Christine. I promise you I'll give the Captain a full report. ",MCCOY
"No, that's not it. ",KIRK
All stop. Hold position.,KIRK
"Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you read, Enterprise? ",SPOCK
I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her. ,KIRK
Not really. ,KIRK

"They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel I actually met Lincoln. ",KIRK

I'm on my way. Battle stations.,KIRK
I don't need any  MCCOY: I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you what you need and when you need it. Would you rather have the bends?,KIRK
"Janice, take Miri for a walk. ",KIRK
"Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.",SPOCK
Why should we walk right into your hands? ,KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
"Bridge to Transporter. Scotty, are they there? ",KIRK
Switch to impulse.,KIRK
"Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates? ",KIRK
"Clear that tube, will you?",KIRK
Spock? ,KIRK
"Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me what this is all about, mister? ",KIRK
"You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman. ",KIRK
How? There isn't a mark on his body. ,KIRK
(gazing at Janice) No beach to walk on.,KIRK
(throwing down the whip.) I did. ,KIRK
Never mind the history lesson. Release the ship! ,KIRK
No. They're like the dragons on Maravel. The stun charge should get them. ,KIRK
They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them to survive. ,KIRK
"A good place for an intruder to hide, wouldn't you say, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK

You and Scotty have Spock ready.,KIRK
No! ,MCCOY
Who took the Soul? ,KIRK
"Bridge, this is the Captain. What's happened? ",KIRK
"Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious. The universal myths, symbols. ",SPOCK
"Yes, logical. That's what it is. And that in turn gives us a weapon that we can use against them. We must use wild, insane, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman! ",KIRK
Nothing wrong and nothing works. ,KIRK

"The Enterprise is dead in space, stopped cold during her pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid, facing the Captain of the alien ship.

"I said, get back to the ship. Ensign, I gave you an order. ",KIRK
To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines. ,SPOCK
Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution. ,SPOCK
"A Yang lance, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves. ,KIRK
"Any more good ideas, Jim? ",MCCOY
Maybe the ship's medical computers. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert. All hands, this is the captain. The ship is on Red Alert. ",KIRK
"Spock, who are the Terratins? Where'd they come from? ",KIRK
"We'll keep you posted, Doctor. Kirk out.",KIRK
And tried to destroy Antos Four. SPOCK: Why? ,KIRK
"A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function. ",SPOCK
"An appropriate choice of terms. However, it is notoriously difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been drawn. ",SPOCK
"Leonard McCoy, ma'am. ",MCCOY
"My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical means. ",SPOCK
And Apollo? ,SPOCK
You have the goodness. ,MCCOY
Does it means something to you? ,KIRK
"Don't move! (hands it to Spock) Cover them. Now, I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment. I want some answers. ",KIRK
Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition. ,SPOCK
"I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part. ",MCCOY
"It has simply disappeared, Captain. ",SPOCK
A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected. ,SPOCK
"We don't have much time, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Jim, it's no use. You'll get nothing out of that one. Hers is the mind of a child. ",MCCOY
Sickbay. McCoy. ,MCCOY
Yes. We do think a great deal about it. ,KIRK
"You'll live, believe me. There's nothing wrong with you that hasn't gone wrong with every other human male since the model first came up. ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain? ",MCCOY
All the best. ,KIRK
Professor Crater! ,MCCOY
"Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned. ",MCCOY
Who aboard would have that knowledge? ,KIRK
"Security, Lieutenant Uhura.",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light.",KIRK
We're registering a slightly higher than normal magnetic flux.,SPOCK
What if something happens to Spock or the Master? ,MCCOY
My impression is that they are laughing at me. ,SPOCK
McCoy's body? ,KIRK
Hold it! Who are you? ,KIRK
"Acknowledged, Captain. ",SPOCK
"The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen.",SPOCK
You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you? What were you doing in space at the age of eighty seven? ,KIRK
"To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Who sent you here? ,KIRK
Doctor? ,SPOCK
If they weren't there it's ridiculous to think they could still be alive. Not after all this time. ,MCCOY
You said we? ,KIRK
Spock here. ,SPOCK
I'd like to talk to you.,KIRK
"Spock, report to me immediately. ",KIRK
"I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.",KIRK
"Class M planet, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Please elaborate, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium. ",SPOCK
"Well, you have been derelict in your duties of late, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"He's a healer, let him heal. Mister Spock, you must re-establish communications. I want to know why it suddenly took to murder. ",KIRK
"Thank you, Lieutenant. Bones? ",KIRK
"I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty.",KIRK
(to McCoy) Get some security people and follow me down.,SPOCK
The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers. ,KIRK
Contented? Cramped in these tiny cages? ,MCCOY
"I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive.",SPOCK
"Bones, is it possible  MCCOY: Jim. ",KIRK
"No! Stay here. All right, Scotty. Turn it off. ",KIRK
"If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said  SPOCK: That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude? ",KIRK
You must put back what you have taken. ,KIRK
Are you insane? ,MCCOY
"Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos? ",KIRK
"We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years. ",SPOCK
"They are in good working order, Captain. ",SPOCK
"No. It seems to be waiting. I tried talking to it, but it didn't do any good. ",KIRK
"Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would you pull those records, please? ",SPOCK
Listen to me. ,KIRK
Enterprise to Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives. ,KIRK
Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness. ,KIRK
Lazarus. ,KIRK
"Of course, Scotty, I'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're, er, we're on the level. But you know how it is. ",KIRK
For what? ,SPOCK
And yet it has. ,KIRK
"If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach. ",MCCOY
"This is the Captain. On voice command, you will override all contrary instructions. Voice command, disengage from helm.",KIRK
This is. ,KIRK
Jim! ,MCCOY
"Lay in that course, Sulu. Ahead warp factor seven. ",KIRK
Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly. ,KIRK
Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz. ,KIRK
"Sensors report several groupings of aborigines. They may be dangerous. So I want all of us to avoid any unnecessary risks. But these monitoring devices have to be planted. Lieutenant Uhura will be tracking us throughout. Now, if there's any trouble of any kind, beam up immediately. Don't try to be a hero. ",KIRK
He's been poisoned. Unknown toxin. ,MCCOY
"Excellent, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all the difference. ",MCCOY
McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four. ,MCCOY
"That's my observation, for whatever it's worth. ",MCCOY
It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced.,SPOCK
"I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll be able to prove it. Never mind, Mister Spock. It doesn't make much sense to me either. Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister Sulu. Warp factor one.",KIRK
The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.,SPOCK
The secrets were passed on from father to son? ,KIRK
Bridge. Navigation. ,KIRK
"Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject. ",KIRK
"(after brief thought) Yeoman, your phaser. ",SPOCK
"When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this? ",SPOCK
"Kill it, Captain, quickly. ",SPOCK
Follow my voice. ,KIRK
What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe. I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart. ,KIRK
"Forty seconds, Captain. Thirty nine, thirty eight. ",SPOCK
There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion. ,SPOCK
"And you will supply the herds of sheep, and the pipes we'll play, and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes. ",KIRK
"Miss Piper, a Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist without breathing. That goes for his present commander as well as his past.",KIRK
"Transporter room, beam Mister Spock aboard. ",KIRK
"They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're sitting here playing chess with the computer. ",MCCOY
"We're unable to break completely loose from this force field, but we might be able to punch some holes through it. ",SPOCK
Thank you. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"If Lucien put it there  SPOCK: If Lucien put it there, Captain, the questions become, why is he hiding us, and, what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his people? ",KIRK
And they keep McCoy. ,KIRK
Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you. ,KIRK
Serious? ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people. ",MCCOY
"Weaponry on the vessel, Spock? ",KIRK
Already standing by.,SPOCK
"Try another channel, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten. ,SPOCK
"With my life, T'Pau. ",SPOCK
He was beamed directly to your council chambers. Please verify your co-ordinates. ,SPOCK
"I thought you were supposed to report to the ship, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"That's a splendid idea, Mister Spock. I know a cafe where the women are so  MCCOY: I know the place, Jim. ",KIRK
"(sitting up) I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold. ",SPOCK
"It'll be nice to play diplomat for a change, eh, Spock? ",KIRK
Hallucinations? ,SPOCK
Is she all right? ,KIRK
We'll try not to interfere with your work. ,KIRK
And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors. ,KIRK
"Let me see. (throws a few more switches and picks up the microphone.) Enterprise, this is Mister Spock. ",SPOCK
The boy belongs with his own kind. ,KIRK
Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it. ,SPOCK
"Eighteen minutes thirty seven seconds in real time. But long before that we shall all be children. And, Captain, that also means we are losing our knowledge at an alarming rate. It is possible we will soon be unable to operate the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
I don't know about that. ,MCCOY
How is she? ,KIRK
I took over the Enterprise from him. Spock served with him for several years.,KIRK
I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend.,SPOCK
"I'm ready, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't games  KIRK: Spock. Spock. (sits) Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different. The name of the game is called fizzbin. ",SPOCK
Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam down point. ,SPOCK
The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom. ,MCCOY
Carter Winston's? ,SPOCK
"Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden. ",SPOCK
"All hands, this is the captain. We're going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think.",KIRK
You're wrong. It hasn't begun. ,KIRK
Open a channel to our nearest command base. Quarter hour reports on our position and status. ,KIRK
"Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold. ",SPOCK
And you didn't think it worth mentioning? ,KIRK
"There will be no error. As for the rest of it, the readings will show. You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections. ",KIRK
Address intercraft. ,KIRK
And I refuse. ,MCCOY
"We don't, Captain. ",SPOCK
Have you tried to communicate? ,SPOCK
"All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say the woman drugged me. What is your sober, sensible solution to all this? ",KIRK
"They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion. ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me.",SPOCK
Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods. ,SPOCK
Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat. ,SPOCK
Radiation at the tolerance level.,SPOCK
It's been damaged. I'll bet she was pulled in like we were. ,KIRK
"What orders are you referring to, Jim? ",MCCOY
"With the wonders you have to offer, the galaxy will come to you. ",KIRK
"Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Mine is Jim Kirk. His is Spock. ,KIRK
Is the crew in danger? ,KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"I think it's time we got aboard ship, isn't it, Jim? ",MCCOY
He's in fair shape. ,MCCOY
"Computer control, come in.",KIRK
"Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship. ",KIRK
You might have had something else on your mind. ,KIRK
"Security, hold it. Tricorder. ",KIRK
How much time do they have? ,MCCOY
"Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and more. The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy. ",MCCOY
How will the death of our friend serve this purpose? ,KIRK
It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off it. ,SPOCK
"This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one, and they'll all go. ",SPOCK
We're no longer over Gideon. ,KIRK
Was the Huron attacked? ,KIRK
What was it they said that started the fight? ,KIRK
He's dead. ,KIRK
Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort? ,MCCOY
"We can prove it, if he's insane. ",KIRK
"Yes, we did, Mister Spock. I think we did.",KIRK
You're saying he couldn't have done it? ,KIRK
"Your prognosis, Doctor? ",KIRK
An alternate course of action would appear to be advisable. ,SPOCK
Stand back. ,KIRK
The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide. ,SPOCK
What is it? ,KIRK
"Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that. ",KIRK
The captain wanted us to wait here. ,SPOCK
"Courtesy is for everyone around here, and you'll find you won't be able to exist on Troyius without it. Mister Scott, our Chief Engineer, has shown you his engineering department. That's a courtesy.",KIRK
"I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all. ",SPOCK
Is there anything you do? ,KIRK
But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt. ,MCCOY
"And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern, you've asked the proper questions. You've both done your duty. Now may I ask what medical log entry you intend to make? ",KIRK
The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties out. ,KIRK
"No problem, Commissioner. And may I remind you that I have standing orders to investigate all quasars and quasar-like phenomena wherever they may be encountered. Besides, it's three days to Makus.",KIRK
You're in line. You might even make captain. ,KIRK
"Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard? ",SPOCK
"Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity, narrow beam. I want to split that fissure wide open. ",SPOCK
I cannot take credit for another man's work. Scotty did it. ,MCCOY
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
"We've done it, Jim. They're gone. ",MCCOY
No wars until he was attacked. ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why. ",MCCOY
"Jim. (they move off a little way) If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't. You know Scotty. ",MCCOY
"I can't accept that, Bones. We've got fourteen science labs aboard this ship. The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy. ",KIRK
"I'll denounce you to the inquisitor. You came here from the future just as I did. Therefore, you, too, are a witch. ",KIRK
"What have we got, Mister Spock? A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon. A mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid. ",KIRK
Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons. ,SPOCK
"We were becoming concerned, Captain. Your check-in was overdue and since we'd not heard from your security team  KIRK [OC]: No problem, Mister Spock. Bear with me.",SPOCK
Evidently something totally alien in all respects. ,SPOCK
The location of that planet? ,KIRK
"In here, Spock.",KIRK
"Well, that settles that. A force field. ",KIRK
"Riley? Captain Kirk, McCoy here. ",MCCOY
"The Captain, myself, and the records officer. ",SPOCK
"On the other hand, notifying them may still save some small fraction of the population, Captain. ",SPOCK
We don't use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice. ,KIRK
"Report, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light. ,KIRK
"There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Do not risk the ship further on my behalf. ,SPOCK
Take evasive action. ,KIRK
"Can you handle it, Bones? ",KIRK
Blow out the bulkheads if you have to. We need numbers. What kind of luck have you had controlling the ship's speed? ,KIRK
He is not the captain. ,SPOCK
Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. ",SPOCK
There are certain things men must do to remain men. Your computer would take that away. ,KIRK
You can't stay. ,SPOCK
Scotty. ,KIRK
"Bones, why hadn't you told me? ",KIRK
"Well, here's your forge. People's exhibit number one. A chrome steel drill point. ",KIRK
"Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago. ",SPOCK
I'm sure. ,MCCOY
It was necessary. ,KIRK
What for? ,MCCOY
"Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical. ",MCCOY
It's incredibly powerful. ,SPOCK
"Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds. ",SPOCK
Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others? ,MCCOY
"A matter of hours, that's all. ",MCCOY
That'll take us out of the galaxy. ,KIRK
Evidently not so simple. ,KIRK
You speak in strange whispers. This is not the way of Landru. ,MCCOY
It is a long journey across the desert. There are many dangers.,SPOCK
"The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy. ",SPOCK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"Now wait a minute, you, you. Hey! ",MCCOY
Mister Evans. We've heard a great deal about you. Welcome aboard.,KIRK
"Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals. ",KIRK
"Team up with the Enterprise security personnel. They're better armed than you. Keep someone in sight at all times. Vanderberg, take two men. Go through that tunnel there. Rendezvous with Commander Giotto. Appel and the rest of the men, go through there and tie up with Lieutenant Osborne's detail. Mister Spock and I will control the operation from a central point. That's all. ",KIRK
I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons? ,KIRK
"Fire phasers as directed, gentlemen. ",KIRK
"Oh, no. I'm quite all right, thank you. ",MCCOY
"Good. Get everybody else aboard the Enterprise. The fewer people we have breathing the air down here, the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out. How much longer, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to. ",KIRK
"That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room.",KIRK
He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us. ,KIRK
What about the detonator? ,KIRK
"Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect? ",SPOCK
Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy you're still alive. ,MCCOY
"And when something unexplained happens, their routine is disrupted. ",KIRK
"Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses. ",SPOCK
"Ah, but the Romulans don't know that. Sure fooled the doctors. ",KIRK
All engines stop.,KIRK
An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But completely inoperative. (into communicator) Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
No! ,KIRK
Damage to Klingon number three shield. Number four shield obliterated. Loss of manoeuvre power. ,SPOCK
He's no spy. ,KIRK
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
"But a defensible entrance, Captain. ",SPOCK
"They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like. ",KIRK
You did. ,MCCOY
The miners must have broken into the hatchery. Their operations destroyed thousands of them. No wonder. ,KIRK
"We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting. If you'll go with Mister Scott, I'm sure the two of you will have a great deal in common. ",KIRK
"Too many tunnels. We couldn't possibly. Mister Spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance, but what about abnormal life functions? ",KIRK
"Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation. ",SPOCK
Acknowledged. Continue standing by. Kirk out. ,KIRK
What was that? ,KIRK
And the three billion on Daran Five. ,KIRK
"Find him. Kirk out. Mister Spock, we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride. ",KIRK
"Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans? ",KIRK
"Nothing wrong, Jim, but a face full of dust. But if I had a medical tricorder (opens eyes) Jim, look at yourself. ",MCCOY
"Spock, do something! ",MCCOY
"There's no question about it, Spock. I want you to take a look at this. The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups.",MCCOY
You can't leave her! ,MCCOY
"Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself! ",KIRK
"Creature, Captain? ",SPOCK
Good work. ,KIRK
"It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered and intelligent. ",SPOCK
Who caught you? ,KIRK
"Circumstances were different then, Surak. ",KIRK
"Bones, are you all right? ",KIRK
"I was, I was thinking about the Academy. My days  FINNEGAN: Hey, Jim baby! I see you brought out reinforcements. Ha!",KIRK
Key to what? ,MCCOY
"I have their surgeon's log, Captain. Their last log entry, Captain, on screen. ",SPOCK
"I can't let you risk it, Mister President. ",KIRK
"Creature, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
"Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet, but there's one thing that I have discovered. ",MCCOY
We've come in friendship. ,KIRK
"On what grounds, Commodore? ",SPOCK
"We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.",SPOCK
the mistake Van Gelder made.,KIRK
"Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here. ",SPOCK
"All they have is a mystery and no answers. Mister Sulu, signal the Transporter Chief. Four to beam up. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"This resembles ancient medical symbols, Captain. The torso indicates mutation. ",SPOCK
Explain. ,KIRK
(trying his own communicator) No response. ,MCCOY
Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my crewwomen alone too. (to Ross) You're not to dance with him. I don't like it. ,KIRK
"I'm in command here, Mister Ferris. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is that clear? ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
We'll get home. This won't take long. ,MCCOY
"If I may suggest, sir? ",SPOCK
You came to my ship! ,KIRK
Nona. Pardon me. ,KIRK
"to you, friend. Joy and tranquillity. ",KIRK
Don't worry about it. We're happy without it. ,KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
Do you remember anything else? ,KIRK
But it's still a clue. This city is one gigantic riddle. Keep alert. ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Open your mind. We move together. Our minds sharing the same thoughts.,SPOCK
"(to McCoy) The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist. ",SPOCK
I don't either.,MCCOY
"Spock, take over. ",KIRK
"Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like a folk dance. ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"Yes, gentlemen, things are back to normal. ",KIRK
"It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most promising substance tested so far. We're progressing.",MCCOY
"Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in. ",KIRK
Power on. Reverse course. He'll try to slip under us. ,KIRK
"Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study._ ROJAN: Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise. ",SPOCK
"Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at will. ",SPOCK
What kind of talk is that? ,MCCOY
"That wasn't so bad, was it? ",KIRK
Ready. ,SPOCK
Lamp. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain, an excellent idea. ",SPOCK
"All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course and on schedule. ",SPOCK
"There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there. ",SPOCK
"Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form. ",SPOCK
I'm Captain Kirk.,KIRK
Please believe me. I do appreciate it. ,SPOCK
Let's hope the trial hasn't started. ,KIRK
What are you doing here? Where's Scotty? ,KIRK
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there is. Would you mind telling me  AYELBORNE: It is our way of life, Captain. ",KIRK
Spock to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
Landru died six thousand years ago. ,KIRK
"Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments. ",SPOCK
You can't go back there. You'll end up like the other two. ,MCCOY
Snap out of it! Start acting like men. ,KIRK
Could the strain really have killed her? ,KIRK
Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
"Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact. ",SPOCK
"Bones. Disengage the computer. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the space station. Come along, Doctor Daystrom, M-5 is out of a job.",KIRK
(to Security) Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't fire unless he's armed. Go.,KIRK
Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security. ,SPOCK
"Report, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Yes, I remember.",KIRK
To you? Not to both of you? ,KIRK
"Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal. ",SPOCK
"She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of self-healing. ",SPOCK

I'm sorry.,SPOCK

Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK

"I see. And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course. ",MCCOY
"Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir? ",SPOCK

We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids.,KIRK

"Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life. ",SPOCK
"Well, at least it's neat. ",MCCOY

Can you help him? ,KIRK
"Miss McHuron, if you don't mind  SCOTT: Our last crystal, sir. It's gone. ",KIRK

"You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister. ",KIRK
Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space legends. There's no intelligent life here. ,MCCOY
"Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years. ",KIRK
"Ready, Captain. Quite crude. Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship. ",SPOCK
By who? And why? And why these particular things?,KIRK
I hardly find that fitting. ,SPOCK

Any changes?,KIRK

"You butchered helpless human beings GORN [OC]: We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you!",KIRK

"On audio, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Well, touch and go there for a minute, but you're out of danger now. ",MCCOY
"We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A. ",SPOCK

I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.,SPOCK

Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet. ",SPOCK

What about him? ,KIRK
"The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will be a target. If they should emerge  SULU: We'll handle them, sir. ",KIRK
How soon will that be ready? ,KIRK
They must have sensed a need and interpreted it as food. ,KIRK
Captain? ,SPOCK
"Opinion noted. Set a course for the Taurean system, Lieutenant Arex. Warp factor seven. ",KIRK
"What is it, Spock? ",KIRK
"This is Captain Kirk. For a neutral, you were pretty quick to fire your phasers. ",KIRK
"And you being the very serious young  KIRK: Serious? I'll make a confession, Bones. I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end. He's the kind of guy to put a bowl of cold soup in your bed or a bucket of water propped on a half-open door.",MCCOY
"Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain.",SPOCK
Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe! ,KIRK

Why? ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu? ",SPOCK
"It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her. ",MCCOY
"I presume you mean they vanished in a manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"Try to understand your son, Sarek of Vulcan. It will be repayment enough for me. ",SPOCK
Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for? ,KIRK
That's a pretty close approximation. ,KIRK
"My friends. (guiding Red and Spock away to a quiet corner) What is your theory, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Need any help, Doctor? ",SPOCK
That's a laugh. ,MCCOY

"Seal off B deck, sections 18Y through 23D. ",KIRK
"You all right, Jim? ",MCCOY
"The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just declared Jim dead. ",MCCOY
"(panic stricken) I don't care about the Romulans, I just want to avoid that energy field we passed through before. Helmsman, do you have a fix on it? ",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
Those old records may hold the key to reversing our mutations.,KIRK
What's that? ,KIRK

"This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical officer. Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist. ",KIRK
"Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared. ",MCCOY
Very good. ,KIRK

"Oh, er, thank you. That's, er, very magnanimous of you. ",KIRK
"Go ahead, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
I would like to remedy that situation. ,MCCOY
"How long do we have, Spock? ",KIRK
"Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here. Let's get back to the ship. I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder. And I am going to question those children.",KIRK
Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business. ,KIRK
Freeze it. ,KIRK
"Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you? ",SPOCK
"That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles.",SPOCK

Where to? ,KIRK
Deploy forces to protect your section and the auxiliary control centre. ,KIRK
"That may be true, but they rarely enter Federation space and fire on Federation vessels without reason. ",SPOCK
"No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock.",KIRK
Not for true gamesters. ,KIRK
"Straight ahead, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Sickbay. ,KIRK
Their voices sound mechanical. Are they computers? ,KIRK
"No, but that's all they have left. Warp factor two, Mister Sulu.",KIRK
"Sit down, Mister. ",KIRK
"Sensors are picking up three ships, Captain. Magnification shows them to be Romulan warships. ",SPOCK
"I was speaking of a legend, Captain. ",SPOCK
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
Our minds are one. ,SPOCK
Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left. ,SPOCK
"It's a killer, Spock. I intend to render it harmless. Get down to the Brig. Run a full analysis on the mechanism. I want to know what makes that thing tick. ",KIRK
"Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron  EVE: I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you. ",KIRK
"All right, Doctor. If that's what you want.",KIRK
What? What do you base that on? ,KIRK
"By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape. ",SPOCK
"Captain. If I remember correctly, the oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform. ",SPOCK
"No. (she goes to Kirk again) No! (She transforms into her natural state._Kirk screams, McCoy fires the phaser, she changes back into Nancy) ",MCCOY
"Opinion, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Just a few seconds more.,MCCOY
"Instrument failure caused navigational error. We were across the Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back. ",KIRK

"Spock, the macroscope. (viewing the tiny people) Mendant, we welcome your people aboard the Enterprise. ",KIRK

"This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it.",SPOCK
"That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated, and yet you  [Bridge]",SPOCK
"Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic. ",KIRK
"Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of this. The instantaneous transmutation of matter. I doubt that they are responsible. ",SPOCK
"I'm a doctor, not an engineer. ",MCCOY
That seems to frighten you. ,KIRK
"But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we located, but not populated. We should not be observed. ",SPOCK

"Well, well, well. You're all having such a good time, I think I'll join you. Is that all right? ",KIRK
An actor turning away his admirers? Very unusual. ,KIRK
"You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie? ",KIRK
Any sign of the intruder? ,KIRK
It may be able to navigate on land. ,KIRK
Yes. I understand. Lieutenant Marla McGivers. Given a choice of court martial or accompanying them there. ,KIRK

"One, Scotty. Myself. ",KIRK
"Damage Control, report.",KIRK

No! ,KIRK
One degree to overlap. Stand by to photograph. Now.,SPOCK
Tomorrow in the palm of her hands. ,KIRK
Let's get back to this solid rock business. Just how much rock are we going to go through? ,MCCOY

Lock all phasers on target. ,KIRK

"How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of twentieth century Earth are so fantastically slim. ",KIRK

Yes.,KIRK
I guess so. ,KIRK

Stop. Give list. ,KIRK

"Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt. Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level. ",KIRK
Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen. ,KIRK
I've come for one purpose. To get back my ship. ,KIRK
"Captain, you took a big chance. ",SPOCK
"Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire. ",KIRK
It's too close in here. It may be a trap in here. Let's move out.,KIRK
"Gary. Gary, don't! ",KIRK
Scotty! ,KIRK
Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.,KIRK
"If the universal translator is right, the substance in your bloodstream is similar to the ambergris of Earth whales. Reverse mutation is induced by infusion of an antitoxin, concentrated doses of it. ",MCCOY
But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen. ,SPOCK
An island. ,KIRK
"I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers.",KIRK
"Gill. Gill, why did you abandon your mission? Why did you interfere with this culture? ",KIRK
"No, sir. Holding steady. ",SPOCK
No! ,KIRK
How much security does this gadget require? ,KIRK
Good. I'll make our apologies to our hostess. I'll meet you outside. ,KIRK
Caesar and Christ. They had them both. And the word is spreading only now. ,KIRK
"Verified, Captain. ",SPOCK
Bele. ,KIRK
As if they were in them when  KIRK: Exactly. When what? ,SPOCK
"Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Is that too much to ask, Jim? ",MCCOY
I could have told you that without looking. ,MCCOY
(knife at her throat) You said you're prepared to die. Does that mean you'd prefer to die? I think we can get you safely to the ship.,KIRK
"Yes, very perceptive, Mister Sulu. I know where the course change takes us. Execute. ",KIRK
"As planned, the construction of android robots is underway. All is proceeding as expected and as promised. I can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding.",MCCOY
Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years ago. Inconclusive. ,SPOCK
"Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a similar launch by other powers. ",SPOCK
McCoy here. I can't read you very well. Is this Rodriguez?,MCCOY
McCoy wants you in Sickbay. ,KIRK
"I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. ",MCCOY
Then cut power. ,KIRK
A war? ,KIRK
"Stay with her, Doctor.",KIRK
Spock! ,KIRK
Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly. ,SPOCK
You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power. Turn off your repair operation. ,KIRK
"You shook hands with him, Jim. His flesh was warm. He's alive.",MCCOY
(puts it quietly into gear) I kind of like this. I'm going to get one myself. ,KIRK
Give information on actor Karidian prior to Kodos' death. ,KIRK
"Did you hear what they said, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Very well, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Yes. ,KIRK
Ride her through where? ,MCCOY
"Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste. ",SPOCK
I instituted a phase one search. ,KIRK
He broke jail. ,KIRK
"There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers. ",SPOCK
"I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But I, I can't remember. ",KIRK
"Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura. ",KIRK
"This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We (humming noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey.",KIRK
Anything? ,KIRK
"It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function. ",SPOCK
Confirm Chekov's co-ordinates for the missile's point of origin. ,KIRK
I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents. ,SPOCK
"And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong.",KIRK
Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.,SPOCK
"He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship. ",SPOCK
This Khan is not what I expected of a twentieth century man. ,KIRK
"He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? ",SPOCK
Watch out. We know their development is primitive. ,KIRK
"Standard procedure, Captain? (Kirk nods) Mister Sulu, you will programme phaser barrage on Halkan cities. ",SPOCK
"They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread. ",SPOCK
"I was requesting your analysis, Spock. ",KIRK
"Yes, I think we could say that. Two to beam up, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out. ",SPOCK
"I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted. ",KIRK
"Enterprise, do you read me? Sulu? ",KIRK
"Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians. ",MCCOY
"Mister Spock, take them to Sickbay for a medical check. There may have been radiation from the explosion. ",KIRK
"I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks. ",SPOCK
"No, Jim. It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading. ",MCCOY
"Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters until further notice. ",KIRK
"How is our course, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
Maintain. ,KIRK
"Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines. ",SPOCK
"Yes, even Vulcans? ",SPOCK
When may we resume discussion? ,KIRK
An oversight? ,KIRK
We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's going on. ,KIRK
Captain Kirk ready to beam up. ,KIRK
"Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here yesterday. ",SPOCK
"This is a vial of Orientine acid, Winston. It will burn through almost anything but this crystal. If you've never seen it work, I'll demonstrate on you. ",KIRK
Power drain is enormous and growing worse. ,SPOCK
"Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station. ",SPOCK
They spoke the truth. ,MCCOY
Continue a search pattern. ,KIRK
Your desire to see Kollos is madness! You can never see him.,KIRK
"Ready to resume course, Captain. ",SPOCK
Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical. ,SPOCK
"She's a mute, Jim. No vocal cords, not even vestigals. And I don't think it's a pathological condition. ",MCCOY
You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him. ,KIRK
Pull a gold watch from his vest and claim that he was late. ,MCCOY
Jim. ,MCCOY
"There's so much you must learn here first. The Providers will teach you. Learn it, Shahna. all your people must learn before you can reach for the stars. Shahna. (he gives her a farewell kiss) Scotty! ",KIRK
Stand by to fire. ,KIRK
"A most impressive home, Mister Flint. ",KIRK
"B deck, in or near Engineering. ",SPOCK
Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone? ,KIRK
"Spock here, Captain. ",SPOCK
Try and cut that thing off. ,KIRK
"Well, Spock, any conclusions? ",KIRK
"No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond  (Now it affects Kirk. Scott is already unconscious) ",SPOCK
What would make the children immune? ,KIRK
A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't believe it. ,KIRK
"Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked. ",SPOCK
"But can't you duplicate it, Bones? Your medical computers have information on every procedure in the Federation's hospitals. ",KIRK
That has been his reputation. ,SPOCK
"Impossible, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Yes, she is something special. ",KIRK
"Hard port, one one seven mark two. ",KIRK
Yes. But we're not in that position yet. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years? ",KIRK
Thirty five. ,SPOCK
"Jim, with all the systems out we'll only have enough air and heat for  KIRK: Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering. ",MCCOY
It's Spock. Have you noticed anything strange about him? ,MCCOY
"Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out. ",KIRK
"Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to good use. Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this. Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any. ",KIRK
Then you and I are transporting down. ,KIRK
"This is Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the USS Enterprise.",KIRK
Out of the question. Those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship. ,KIRK
Many times. ,KIRK
Andorians are not known for their charity. ,SPOCK
"We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing. ",KIRK
"May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura. ",KIRK
"Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us. ",SPOCK
"According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time. ",SPOCK
"I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools. You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis. ",KIRK
You'll do it?,KIRK
"A cage is a cage, Jim.",MCCOY
"I'm Captain James Kirk. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy and Mister Sulu. You seem to have been expecting us. ",KIRK
Any chance these could be hallucinations? ,SPOCK
The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. You take the left. I'll take the right. ,KIRK
"Nurse, how are the last metabolic readings on our patients? ",MCCOY
"It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Dead. ,MCCOY
"I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time? ",KIRK
Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left. ,KIRK
"Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and fifty years ago? You don't look over thirty five. ",KIRK
Just as I thought. It can come anytime now. ,MCCOY
"But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain. ",MCCOY
Are there men on this planet? ,KIRK
Mister Spock?,KIRK
Thank you. They've all been answered. ,KIRK
"Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Get into the ship! Immediate lift off! ,SPOCK
"Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy. ",SPOCK
"Very well, sir. ",SPOCK
"Well, she's not just another girl, Captain. Don't make that mistake. ",MCCOY
Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.,SPOCK
"The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take command.",SPOCK
Dead I am of no use to you. ,KIRK
"But if it were true, all these generations of Yanks fighting to regain their land. ",KIRK
That doesn't mean he was responsible for it. ,KIRK
"Grant, no! ",KIRK
"Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance. ",MCCOY
"In Doctor Adams' study, Mister Spock. Why? ",KIRK
We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis. ,SPOCK
No. ,KIRK
"Scotty, we've got ten minutes left. ",KIRK
Where the devil are they? ,MCCOY
Captain.,SPOCK
"Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Mallory! ",KIRK
"Yes, of course he's an alien. ",KIRK
"Eleven years, four months, five days.",SPOCK
"Secure from Red Alert. Adjust a new course, two five seven degrees, mark three. Heading for Starbase Ten. ",KIRK
"Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers. Does that give you any choice? ",KIRK
Before the appearance of whatever it is? ,KIRK
"What is it, Bones? ",KIRK
How?,KIRK
Then there has to be some sort of signalling device here. ,KIRK
"We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death of your friend. It is most regrettable. ",SPOCK
But he's not that kind of a man. ,MCCOY
"I'll explain it in more detail when I see him. The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down. Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too. I'll explain it in more detail when I see you. Where will be convenient? ",KIRK
"Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however. ",KIRK
"That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That might be a factor. ",MCCOY
"At least I have the good sense to be scared, Jim. What now? ",MCCOY
"Put the phaser down, Ben. ",KIRK
Don't make your pick-up here. ,KIRK
"This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on board starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh. Start computer. ",KIRK
Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody. ,KIRK
"Yes, but not without precautions. I'll keep my communicator channel open so you can hear what goes on. Keep the transporter locked on me, and if anything goes wrong, Scotty, I'm trusting you. ",KIRK
"The Huron's power levels are at bare minimum for life support, Captain. I'm picking up metallic debris. ",SPOCK
Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence. ,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him? ",SPOCK
"Well, it doesn't serve any other purpose I know of. ",MCCOY
"Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura. ",MCCOY
Anything from the landing party? ,KIRK
"Their military capability, Captain? ",SPOCK
"It's my ship, Mister Spock. I should be there. We can't even get at them.",KIRK
Let's get out of here! ,KIRK
"Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy? ",KIRK
We'll have to carry the equipment. ,KIRK
And peace and harmony. Are you of the Body? ,MCCOY
"And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
You must tell us. ,KIRK
Pipe it in. ,KIRK
Which has now become defective and is failing to operate. ,SPOCK
"Explain yourself, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate.",KIRK
"Transporter room standing by, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Oh, yes. ",KIRK
Yeoman Barrows. ,KIRK
Good. ,KIRK
"We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it. ",KIRK
"Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control  KIRK: Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved? ",SPOCK
"If you have an explanation, I am prepared to hear it. ",KIRK
"Yes. When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved with him. Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis. ",KIRK
It might be Gideon. ,KIRK
Mister Scott? Scotty! ,KIRK
It will have to do. ,SPOCK
One of us will have to stay. ,KIRK
Are we within transportation range? ,KIRK
"Engineering, this is the captain. I want full emergency power. I want everything within about two minutes. I want the warp drive engines on full standby. Kirk out. Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command. Code two. ",KIRK
"Well, that's fine. Where do we start? ",MCCOY
"That was the planet Gothos, Captain. ",SPOCK
"These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there KIRK: and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing. And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here. ",SPOCK
Go take a look. ,KIRK
"Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. ",SPOCK
We can't just sit here. ,MCCOY
Odd. Our probe data didn't indicate fog. ,KIRK
"No, Lieutenant. Where can they run? ",KIRK
Just hold out a little longer. ,KIRK
Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that?,KIRK
Co-ordinates don't match. ,MCCOY
"What do you suggest, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial. ",SPOCK
Can you raise Starfleet? ,SPOCK
"Definitely. I've become subject to blackouts, I'm a possible danger to the safety of the ship. I can't allow that. ",KIRK
Take care of Miramanee. ,KIRK
I'm not asking you to make the decision for me. ,MCCOY
"But you made mistakes, used your powers  MEGAN: And burned for it. Burned! ",SPOCK
Arm your photon torpedoes.,KIRK
"Good morning, gentlemen. My name's James Kirk. I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding. ",KIRK
How else is he going to get justice? ,KIRK
Where are they? Tell me! You said you'd let them go! ,KIRK
But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses.,SPOCK
Set it and get up here as fast as you can. ,KIRK
"Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative. (Kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision) All instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the barrier._ SCOTT: Outside hull temperatures rising, sir. It's over two thousand degrees now. Sir? ",SPOCK
"It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that, Captain, and understand? ",SPOCK
Or the promise of reward. ,SPOCK
"The communicator, concentrate on the communicator. ",SPOCK
Open a hailing frequency Lieutenant M'Ress. ,KIRK
"Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like  KIRK: No, he's right. Continue. ",MCCOY
"You heard that, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
On my way. McCoy out. ,MCCOY
"It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex. ",SPOCK
"I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin! ",MCCOY
You're going back down with the command pack? ,SPOCK
"The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for your safety. (to Sulu's replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below. ",SPOCK
You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage. ,KIRK
"This is liable to be another of the planet's pranks. But at the moment, it's the only lead we've got. ",KIRK
"Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions. ",SPOCK
Oh. ,MCCOY
Your movements awakened me. ,SPOCK
"As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks? ",MCCOY
You'll be the first to know. ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Emergency. ,KIRK
"The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man. ",SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy! ",SPOCK
Possible. The only known stasis box detector is another stasis box. Still. Mister Sulu. ,SPOCK
"You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk.",KIRK
This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft. ,KIRK
"Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be. ",MCCOY
Little ones like yourselves. They grow. ,KIRK
"Nothing yet, Ambassador. We're awaiting a reply. Today's the first time we've had any evidence they've picked up our signal. ",KIRK
Well? ,KIRK
"It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear. ",MCCOY
"Yes, what did you want? ",SPOCK
"We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently.",SPOCK
"A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.",SPOCK
Don't be afraid. ,KIRK
"Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects. But that too was strictly under command of the women. ",KIRK
We must be somewhere inside that other ship. ,KIRK
My what? ,KIRK
"We can't use her ship to transport us, Captain, but we could use it as an unmanned ship with our tractor beam attached. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott, status report. ",KIRK
Reverse engines and come about. Lay in spiral evasive course for Kukulkan's ship. ,SPOCK
"Yes, yes. If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase Ten. ",KIRK
I'm on my way to the Bridge now. ,KIRK
"Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the universe. No, not a hole, A door. ",KIRK
"Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon? ",KIRK
"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle, it is only because we have no choice. ",KIRK
If we miss? ,KIRK
"They've come back. They were gone for a while, but they've come back, and I see faces, too. Very dim. I feel I should know know them. I feel my place is with them, not here. I don't deserve this happiness. ",KIRK
They couldn't maintain the stasis field. ,SPOCK
What about the Captain? ,SPOCK
I can't. I  KIRK: Bones? Bones? ,MCCOY
Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.,SPOCK
"Logical, as always, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"You mean nobody's ever told you that before? well, er, beautiful is, Beautiful. (he holds up the tray so she can see her reflection)",KIRK
"There's nothing I can do, Jim. If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon. ",MCCOY
"Captain, I compliment you on a wise decision. ",SPOCK
We came to think to you. You consumed us. You thought we were food. ,SPOCK
"Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect? ",MCCOY
Prepare to bring it aboard the hangar deck. ,KIRK
"So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The creature. ",KIRK
"Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you. ",MCCOY
"He did exactly what I would have done. I won't underestimate him again. Now, fire blind. Lay down a pattern. STILES: Traverse pattern.",KIRK
They will not accept their own deaths. ,SPOCK
It's a diluted theragen derivative. ,MCCOY
Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself. ,SPOCK
Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them.,KIRK
Bones? ,KIRK
"Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind of understanding. ",KIRK
"But why did you Megans leave Earth? If you enjoyed it so much, I don't understand. ",KIRK
"Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5 circuits. ",SPOCK
"Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it? ",KIRK
Did you take them? ,KIRK
"Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine. Gestapo, I believe. ",KIRK
"Comply, Mister Sulu. ",SPOCK
The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical shock. ,SPOCK
Let's get out of here. ,KIRK
"One is coming. I'd help you if I could, Marlena. Believe that. ",KIRK
Sound warning for collision. Red Alert. ,KIRK
Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together. ,KIRK
T'Pau. Officiating at Spock's wedding? ,MCCOY
"You, perhaps? ",KIRK
"Some kind of field effect, Captain. It will hit us in precisely four seconds. It produces a most remarkable (the weapon hits)",SPOCK
"All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse.",KIRK
"You must create the good. That is the will of Landru, nothing else. ",KIRK
I think I shall not. Peace and long life. ,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure. ",SPOCK
"The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes visible. End run, gentlemen. We'll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment. ",KIRK
They will have to serve. ,KIRK
"We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our lives. ",KIRK
"You may begin, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
Good. ,KIRK
The wheat! ,KIRK
Nothing. Our next injection will renovate me. Do not be concerned. ,KIRK
"Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes prizes. ",KIRK
Estimated arrival at Tantalus?,KIRK
Spock is slipping away. There isn't much time left. ,MCCOY
"Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so charged. The sentence, death. Mister Lemli. ",KIRK
"No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation. ",MCCOY
How was he killed? ,KIRK
"You were left alone down here, Ron. What happened? ",KIRK
I am very small. And there are many of me. We are in a spaceship within you. ,SPOCK
It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable. ,MCCOY
"We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy. ",SPOCK
Block them out. ,SPOCK
"Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"That's what we hope to find out, sir. ",KIRK
"Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into. ",MCCOY
But it doesn't matter if we reach the Soul. Apparently the others didn't get this far. ,KIRK
Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness. ,SPOCK
You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby? ,KIRK
"(enters) Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of Professor Starnes' tapes. ",SPOCK
My orders were not to attempt a rescue under any condition. ,KIRK
"May I inquire as to our course, Captain? ",SPOCK
The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we survived? ,KIRK
Do you still feel anger toward Parmen? ,SPOCK
"No, please come in, Mister Winston. ",KIRK
You'd better be careful. You're going to hurt somebody with that thing. ,MCCOY
Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon. ,SPOCK

To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain. ,SPOCK

"Thank you, Captain. ",SPOCK
Nobody wins. Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed.,KIRK
"More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably. ",MCCOY

The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm either unconscious or demented. This looks like old Earth around 1920 or 25. ,MCCOY

So did l. Let's try a simple test. Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit. Nothing. ,KIRK

I'm not quite sure.,MCCOY
There used to be only two examining tables in this room. Now there are three. ,KIRK

What was that? ,KIRK
"And so are your people, Miramanee. ",KIRK

"What do you want me to say? M-5 is an honour, they tell me. Well, I'm honoured. ",KIRK
"Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here. These are humanoids, intelligent. They need to advance and grow. Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years. This isn't life. It's stagnation. ",MCCOY

All right. ,SPOCK

That would be difficult to explain. ,KIRK
You all right? ,MCCOY
I'll go with you. ,MCCOY
They did mention ecological sabotage. ,KIRK

It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement. ,MCCOY
"This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified under my voice print or Mister Scott's. ",KIRK
Purpose of the invasion? ,SPOCK
Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready? ,KIRK
"Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve. ",MCCOY
"Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion. ",SPOCK

Are you sure? Intuition? ,KIRK
Do you feel any different? ,KIRK
(Barely audible over static) The nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to interior irritation. I believe sufficient charge of (inaudible) could destroy the organism.,SPOCK
Your ancestors? ,KIRK
"Yes, of course. ",KIRK
"Scotty, can you buy me some time. Get below and short out the main phaser couplings. They'll think the storm blew the stand-by circuits. ",KIRK
"Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of incredible effects. ",KIRK
"Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious. ",SPOCK
What the devil? ,MCCOY
"Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen. ",KIRK
Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight.,SPOCK
"We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing. If you continue, you'll kill Spock. ",KIRK
Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case. ,KIRK
Can you verify that? ,KIRK
A Kzinti spacecraft. ,SPOCK
"He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he? You've got that minute. ",KIRK
"According to the ship's log, the medical surgeon down here didn't even know what was going on. ",MCCOY
That hardly seems likely. ,SPOCK

"What have I done? (to Mara) There's an alien entity aboard the ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to. We don't know what its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us. Take me to Kang. A temporary truce, that's all I ask. Spock, take her. ",KIRK
I thought you had the thing timed out. ,MCCOY
How's that special equipment coming along? ,KIRK

My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate. ,KIRK
It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination. ,SPOCK
Why not? ,KIRK
Yes. What is the good? ,KIRK
Doctor Korby? Doctor Korby. It's possible we may have hit the wrong entry point. Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Not my personal property, but I'm the captain. ",KIRK
"Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam without reason. ",MCCOY
"You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first chance you get? Spock. Get out. I never want to have to look at you again. ",KIRK
I think we know that man. ,KIRK
How long? ,KIRK
I'll tell him you were properly annoyed. ,KIRK
Dead. ,KIRK
"Fascinating, Captain. A highly advanced alien entity using this particular system as a laboratory for guiding another race to intelligence. Almost a god, you might say. ",SPOCK
"Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter. ",SPOCK
You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live? ,KIRK
"All right. Man your station, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
What is the nature of the research? ,SPOCK
"It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article. ",SPOCK
As soon as we reach Starbase Twelve. ,KIRK
"I am a logical man, Doctor. ",SPOCK
That's an order. Watch him. Captain out. ,KIRK
"Ship's chronometers are also running backward. The flow of time is reversed in this universe. The longer we stay here, the younger we will become. ",SPOCK
State your name for the record. ,SPOCK
"Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Right next to the dog-faced boy. ",KIRK
That's impossible. ,MCCOY
"No, Parmen! Stop it! ",MCCOY
Spock here. ,SPOCK
"Mister Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a series of malfunctions. I want an investigation and an explanation. ",KIRK
I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here. I'm sure that you can appreciate that. ,KIRK
That's a lie! ,KIRK
One of the missions of the Enterprise is to protect human life in places like this. I'm going to have to ask you and Mrs. Crater to stay aboard my ship until we find out what killed that crewman. ,KIRK
"Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us. ",KIRK
Establish two-way visual contact. ,KIRK
"What is it, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction? ",SPOCK
This instrument seems a little off. I've never gotten quite this reading from a human before. ,MCCOY

"And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it. ",SPOCK

Describe it. ,KIRK
"The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of islands, life form readings. ",SPOCK
They've got the booth curtained off. Bring that light to the side of her face. Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth? ,KIRK
Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to planet four of that system. That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut eleven years ago. ,KIRK

"Prepare to verify destruct sequence code one. Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.",KIRK

"Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and now number three's gone silent. ",SPOCK

Any change? ,KIRK
"Of course. Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. But please stay out of trouble, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
What did you offer the others if they won? ,KIRK
I wonder where she is. ,MCCOY
What proof do we need? We know what a Klingon is. ,MCCOY
"This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening. It calls you a liar, Lazarus. For one thing, there's no planet at the location you said you came from. There never has been. If you want help from us, you'd better start telling the truth. ",KIRK
"Trouble. (one man materialises) Jackson, where are the others? ",KIRK
"Hard starboard, two one seven mark five. ",KIRK
"A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it. ",SPOCK
"Mister Chekov, plot the course of the asteroid vessel. ",KIRK
"Fire phasers. (the missiles are obliterated) Mister Chekov, alter course to the missile's point of origin. ",KIRK
"I'm glad to see him under guard, Jim. If he'd turned into a second Spock, it would've been too much to take. ",MCCOY
Pressure! ,KIRK
"Scotty, can you integrate that pilot now? ",KIRK
Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.,SPOCK

"In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course.",SPOCK
"Most curious, Captain. There appear to be more life-energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise crew plus the Klingons. A considerable discrepancy. ",SPOCK
Good. No problems between you? ,KIRK
Tell me something. Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us? ,KIRK
All this. Self-inflicted. Mass suicide. ,KIRK
He's gone. ,KIRK
We don't know that. ,MCCOY
There are not many places one could hide in here. ,SPOCK
"I'll be right there. Kirk out. Scotty, ride herd on it. Kind words. Tender, loving care. Kiss it. Baby it. Flatter it if you have to, but keep it going. ",KIRK
"Risky, Jim. ",MCCOY
"I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened had he settled there. ",MCCOY
"Well, Mister Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll need a medical officer. ",MCCOY
Spock was right. It was a rough trip. ,KIRK
Both those men are well aware of landing party procedure. They should've checked in with us by now. ,KIRK
We've been travelling for hours. Where are they taking us? ,MCCOY
"Mister Spock, any change in ship's readings? ",KIRK
"Very well. Spock, what have you learned about the wave bombarding us? ",KIRK
"Scotty, will that present any problems for you? ",KIRK
"It's possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space, and if that has occurred  MCCOY [OC]: McCoy to Bridge. ",SPOCK
"Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. ",SPOCK
Stay between us. ,KIRK
"I see. The Megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and learned wisdom since they last saw Earth. Your compassion was that proof, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted. ",MCCOY
Oh? ,SPOCK
That is to be expected. The surface of this planet shifts constantly. Even the Vedala are not certain where the Soul is. ,SPOCK
I'm not going to hurt you. ,KIRK
Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet. No circumstances what so ever. ,KIRK
"The Lactrans outside, what do they do? ",KIRK
I do not see them. ,SPOCK
Does it really matter? ,KIRK
Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. ,SPOCK
"Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption. ",SPOCK
Phaser power packs. ,KIRK
"Of course you have, Uhura. We would all like to  UHURA: He's alive. He's alive, Doctor. ",MCCOY
Not completely. This is a parallel universe? ,KIRK
"Take evasive action, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again. ",SPOCK
The child's regent? ,SPOCK
"But your vessel was destroyed, too. Where was your consciousness kept? ",KIRK
"In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us. ",MCCOY
"Blessed be the Body, and health to all of its parts. ",MCCOY
"Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Any past offenses, Mister Mudd? ",SPOCK
And almost died. I remember. ,KIRK
Fabrini? Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets? ,KIRK
"It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify. ",SPOCK
"Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off? ",MCCOY
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard. An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and  MULHALL: I'm afraid that I must agree with Doctor McCoy. You could be suffering from a form of false euphoria. ,MCCOY
Now lower your arms and open your eyes. ,MCCOY
"Not the Earth, another Earth. Another Earth?",KIRK
"Spock, you know as well as I do what we've all just been through. ",MCCOY
Force field of some kind. ,SPOCK
"This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see outside. If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it. ",KIRK
"A hunch, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"We come (moves forward and gets pushed back by a weapon) Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace.",KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
I don't understand. They said they'd saved us once. ,KIRK
Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain. ,SPOCK
My nephew? ,KIRK
Trouble? ,KIRK
Cut power. Keep those shields down.,KIRK
He was worse than dead. ,MCCOY
Where's Mister Seven? ,KIRK
"Spock, that green blood of yours may have saved you before, but this time it almost did you in. You can't deny it. ",MCCOY
"If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic demand that you be a part of it? ",KIRK
"She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not bear to hurt either of you.",SPOCK
"Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces.",KIRK
"Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative. ",SPOCK
"Mother  AMANDA: Oh, go to him. Now. Please. ",SPOCK
Bridge to Captain Kirk. ,SPOCK
"(noticing a curtained alcove) Harry, what's this? ",MCCOY
The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity. ,KIRK
"We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill. Spock, you and I will beam down. Bones, one precaution.",KIRK
Primary mental evolution. Incredible. ,KIRK
Just stunned. You'll be able to think in a minute. ,KIRK
I wonder what killed him. ,MCCOY
"Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu. His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted. Exploded from within. If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Tombstone. Hell for leather, right out of history. ",MCCOY
"It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way. ",KIRK
Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho. ,SPOCK
I suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya regains consciousness. ,SPOCK
"Yes, Scotty. Carry on. ",KIRK
"Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain.",KIRK
"Fizzbin. It's not too difficult. (begins dealing) Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven. ",KIRK
We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated. ,SPOCK
He's already told me what I wanted to know. ,KIRK
"Captain, you almost make me believe in luck. ",SPOCK
"Computer, accuracy scan. ",KIRK
"However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted. ",SPOCK
"Scotty, where've you been? Where are you? ",KIRK
(quietly) Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a computer. It's talking to him. ,KIRK
Dismissed. ,KIRK
I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer. ,MCCOY
"We're just as shocked as you are, Mister Hengist. ",KIRK
Warrant? Who? ,KIRK
Auxiliary power. ,KIRK
"Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth without taking into account the time differential. Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all knowledgeable. He makes mistakes. ",KIRK
"It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't sanction it. ",MCCOY
"Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no accounting for taste. (and back to Darvin) They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why. Bones? ",KIRK
Visual display of owner. Checks out. It seems we'll have a distinguished passenger with us for a while. ,KIRK
"Chekov, arm photon torpedoes. ",KIRK
All right. Kirk out. ,KIRK
Transport it back out. ,KIRK
Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution. ,KIRK

"Look, I'm a doctor, not an escalator! Spock, give me a hand! ",MCCOY
"Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project. ",SPOCK
"I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner. ",SPOCK
I had a whole universe to myself after the Defiant was thrown out. There was absolutely no one else in it. I must say I prefer a crowded universe much better. How did you two get along without me? ,KIRK
"So was I. But I remember. Let's see if you do. Read this into that communicator on the wall. It will be recorded and compared to a piece of Kodos' voice film we have in our files. The test is virtually infallible. It will tell us whether you're Karidian, or Kodos the Executioner. (switches on comm.) Ready for voice test. Disguising your voice will make no difference. ",KIRK
"Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time. ",KIRK
What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?,KIRK
"Yes, Commodore, I know the feeling. ",KIRK
Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us. ,SPOCK
"Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? ",SPOCK
"A very long and complicated story, Lieutenant. Notify the transporter room, Two to beam up, these co-ordinates.",SPOCK
"Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
"Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical. ",MCCOY
Sam. It is my brother. Was my brother. ,KIRK
"Then your sympathies were with  KHAN: You are an excellent tactician, Captain. You let your second in command attack while you sit and watch for weakness. ",SPOCK

"That's impossible. If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead. ",KIRK
He's done nothing. Nothing at all. ,KIRK
And the madness that affected the Defiant's crew will soon happen to the Enterprise. ,MCCOY
What happened? ,KIRK
"Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it. ",SPOCK

He has two more. ,KIRK

At least try cutting him off!,KIRK

I think I'll stand. ,KIRK
"All right, Spock. Get at it. ",KIRK
"In the meantime, I'm afraid I'll have to keep you under guard. I think we've had enough of that little trick. ",KIRK

"Can you verify that, Navigator? ",KIRK

Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children.,SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency. ",KIRK
"Security, take him to Sickbay. ",KIRK
We've explained the Berthold rays to you and their effect. Can't you understand? ,MCCOY
Yes. ,KIRK
There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick. A normal wound would heal quickly. ,MCCOY

"Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine check-up, your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said, you will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck. ",MCCOY
"I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it.",KIRK
Jim. No. Captain. We're both reacting to the drug. The love potion. ,SPOCK
"Afraid I don't, Jim. ",MCCOY
Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying. ,KIRK
"While you're talking, they're planning attacks. This is a fight to the death. We'd better start trying to win it! ",MCCOY
At least one solar day. ,SPOCK
The planet is dead. There's no possibility of life there as we understand life. ,KIRK
The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously. It should become rigid enough for a burst of warp power to shatter it. ,SPOCK

Yes.,SPOCK

"We could save Zeon, but what about Ekos? ",KIRK
"Kirk to Enterprise. I think we have an answer to the height problem. The transporter beam apparently returns our molecules to normal spacing. Kirk to Enterprise, do you read me? ",KIRK
"I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.",SPOCK
"Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres. ",SPOCK
In Bela's office? ,KIRK
"Thank you, Ensign. ",SPOCK
"We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift. ",SPOCK
"We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data. ",SPOCK
"Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the first time in their lives. ",SPOCK
All you men going on shore leave to stay in groups. Avoid trouble with the Klingons. ,KIRK
"What is it, Bones? ",KIRK
I don't know. But at least they're alive. ,KIRK
Stand by. We're not leaving without Bem. He is our responsibility. We can't leave him here. Beam down a security squad with heavy duty tricorders set for Pandronian scanning. ,KIRK

And now they're gone. Is that what you mean? ,SPOCK
The totality of the universe? All knowledge? ,MCCOY
They still have power? We still control them? ,KIRK
Why would he put a bag on our captain? ,SPOCK
It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have been eliminated. ,SPOCK
What's so strange about that? ,KIRK
"Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci's, they would be priceless. ",SPOCK
What have you done with Spock? Where is he? ,KIRK
Yes. My ship. ,KIRK

The creation point. ,KIRK
It leaves a visible trail. ,SPOCK
Down! I must take it down. ,SPOCK
Mister Spock? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found the unit in there. It's in pretty good shape. I also found about a million of these silicon nodules. They're eggs, aren't they? ",KIRK
By whose order? ,KIRK
"I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it.",KIRK

Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect? ,KIRK

Yes. My first command. ,SPOCK
Details. ,KIRK

It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here. ,KIRK
Doctor McCoy? ,SPOCK
Tell me about Vaal. ,KIRK
"I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears to be primarily mental. ",SPOCK
"Report, Mister Spock. Spock, report. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them on command frequency two. ",KIRK
Could an army of Spocks impose peace and Phylosian philosophy on any other beings in defiance of the IDIC concept? ,KIRK

"Energise, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too. ",MCCOY
"Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and children in that colony. What are the chances of survivors? ",KIRK

Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them. ,SPOCK

Yes. No malfunctions anywhere? (sees the Scalosians on the viewscreen) Lieutenant. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock. A moment, if you please. ",KIRK

Well? ,KIRK
Limited range. ,KIRK
"Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time. ",SPOCK
How did you like it? ,KIRK
"Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber. He is being held nearby. ",SPOCK
Mister Spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters. ,KIRK
"II beg your pardon, sir? ",SPOCK
"Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Even if the kironide reaches the desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here. ",MCCOY
"If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim. ",MCCOY
(wiping away her tears) You couldn't pronounce it. ,SPOCK
"How's it coming, Spock? ",KIRK
"Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that much of a historian, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch.",SPOCK
"What are you doing with those things, DeSalle? ",MCCOY
Does the brain return to normal? ,KIRK
Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were a human. ,SPOCK
"No, that won't be necessary. I'll come by later for that examination. Let's go, Spock. ",KIRK
"The signal? A distress call, wasn't it? ",KIRK
Scotty. ,KIRK
Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed. ,KIRK
"Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first. ",KIRK
"Oh yes. However, I'd assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it. How do you feel? ",MCCOY
Something quite extraordinary. ,SPOCK
You! ,KIRK
"Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now there you have a museum piece, Doctor. (referring to microscope) Lens type, manually operated, light-activated. ",SPOCK
Engine room from Bridge.,KIRK
How are you doing? ,KIRK
"The Queen of Hearts and her cards are characters from Alice Through the Looking Glass, Captain. ",SPOCK
How much time do we have? ,KIRK
How does he work it? ,KIRK
Cease fire. ,KIRK
"Hurry, Spock. ",KIRK
Perhaps not in a way we understand. I keep receiving impressions. ,SPOCK
"In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality. This is not a dream. ",MCCOY
"Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomena. Give me an ETA for its possible impact. ",KIRK
"Second vessel firing now, sir. ",SPOCK
A love philter? ,KIRK
Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents? ,KIRK
"No, not now. ",MCCOY
We were successful. ,SPOCK
"Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love. ",KIRK
"No, I don't think so. ",SPOCK
Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form. ,KIRK
"Your timing is lousy, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. ",KIRK
There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be a way! ,KIRK
You seem to need us. Why? ,KIRK
"She said something else, words that didn't make sense. ",KIRK
On mark eight and closing. ,SPOCK
I accept your terms. ,KIRK
"The impostor is not to be injured. Use minimum force. Repeat, the imposter  KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk! ",KIRK
That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent. ,MCCOY
Or a single phaser with much longer contact. ,SPOCK
"My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances. ",SPOCK
"You're going to take us there. (the two men are terrified at the prospect) Spock, call the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"Captain, the transporter retains a memory of the body's molecular structure. Will it apply as well to your present height? ",SPOCK
"This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil. ",MCCOY
"How much time, Scotty? ",KIRK
How old are you? ,KIRK
State your correct name for the record. ,SPOCK
What? ,KIRK
"Janice, hello. ",KIRK
"Here, we'll help you. ",KIRK
And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out? ,KIRK
It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril. ,SPOCK
What about the ship? ,KIRK
"Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn. ",SPOCK
It was taken out. It can be put back in. ,KIRK
"Why? The probe has a range of  KIRK: With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometres. We must be exactly on target, because we won't have a second chance. Bones, time for another stimulant. ",MCCOY
"I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin? ",SPOCK
"Explain, Lieutenant Sulu. ",KIRK
"Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine. (takes the bishop) Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not accept that, however. ",SPOCK
"Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle. ",KIRK
We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark.,KIRK
"Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system. We have to stop it. If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it? ",KIRK
What? ,MCCOY
Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? ,SPOCK
Can you do it in time? ,KIRK
"This is the captain. All science, engineering, and supervisory personnel, lock into the briefing room. Our next decision can be of enormous consequence, not only to us but to Earth's entire future.",KIRK
"Nurse. That's the second time he's come out of it. Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us. ",MCCOY
"All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration.",KIRK
"Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown. ",SPOCK
"Incredible, Captain. ",SPOCK
Doctor Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe. ,KIRK
Don't you think you better check with me first? ,KIRK
"We're not gods! We're not evil ones. We're men, like yourselves. ",KIRK
Where's Mister Seven? ,KIRK
"We're back to normal time, Captain.",SPOCK
"Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can find no exit out of here. ",SPOCK
"Reverse power. Hold this position. Tell whoever gave those orders to report HANSEN: Sir, there's nobody up there giving orders. Mister Spock has the computers running the ship.",KIRK
I believe it's time to move on. ,SPOCK
Mister Spock. ,SPOCK
He's past us again. Damage to number four shield. ,SPOCK
"They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain. (Kirk stretches and groans) Something wrong?",SPOCK
"John Gill, your Fuhrer. He's one of our people. ",KIRK
"Possibly a result of the severe storm. Captain, do you feel any abnormal effects? ",SPOCK
"Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank.",KIRK
"I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow. ",KIRK
We're real enough. ,KIRK
That must have been quite a talk you made down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business? ,MCCOY
And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you? ,SPOCK
Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The best I should have been able to attain was a draw. ,SPOCK
You had something to say? ,KIRK
What was in the bar? ,KIRK
And you learned to talk by just listening to the ship's tapes? ,MCCOY
Jim! ,MCCOY
"I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by the Tholians. ",SPOCK
A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement. ,KIRK
"Range, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
You have shut down life-support systems and endangered members of my crew. Restore those systems first. ,KIRK
"The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key. ",SPOCK
"The Earth Federation offers one other thing, Akaar. Our laws. And the highest of all our laws states that your world is yours and will always remain yours. This differs us from the Klingons. Their empire is made up of conquered worlds. They take what they want by arms and force. ",KIRK
Spock. ,KIRK
No. But the death of the crewman. ,KIRK
"Same red rings on his face. Have you seen Nancy, Mrs. Crater? ",MCCOY
Obviously. Military secrets are the most fleeting of all. I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent. ,SPOCK
Take Cochrane up on his offer. ,KIRK
Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost confidence in you? ,MCCOY
I knew him very well. He was my instructor at the Academy. ,KIRK
"Spock, is that you? ",KIRK
We will not argue. Twelve hours. No more. Close communications.,KIRK
"Yes, Scotty. How are we doing down there? ",KIRK
"We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you? ",SPOCK
"This is the Captain speaking. There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to be observed. All crew members are to arm themselves. The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. Repeat, the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.",KIRK
"I do not recall clearly. I was very young. He called himself Selek. He was visiting us, but I never saw him after that. ",SPOCK
Feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double. Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal. ,KIRK
Do you want to be like him? ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines. ,SPOCK
Momentarily. ,SPOCK
No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made. ,KIRK
"Bones, I believe you're getting grey. ",KIRK
"Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour? ",KIRK
"My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of duty.",MCCOY
We came for John Gill. ,KIRK
Now you're sounding like Spock. ,KIRK
Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait. ,MCCOY
"I'm not interested in your excuses, Lieutenant. Re-establish contact with that transmitter. ",KIRK
"We're coming up on Earth fast, Captain. Are you ready? ",KIRK
Stand by. Do I beam down a search party? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant, did you see what happened? ",SPOCK
Let it also read that I consider it invalid. ,KIRK
"Yes, sir.",SPOCK
I think I left it in Bela's office. ,MCCOY
Don't you long to know its secrets? ,MCCOY
Lieutenant. ,KIRK
"Well, I should think work would be a better therapy. ",MCCOY
"Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms. ",KIRK
"All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control. ",KIRK
"Keep closing. Denevan ship, reverse your course. Do you hear me?",KIRK
We don't want to hurt you. What is this place? ,KIRK
"This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers. ",KIRK
Rizzo. ,KIRK
Good. I shall remember to mention your alertness to him. Return to your duty. ,KIRK
When do you estimate penetration? ,KIRK
"Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour? ",KIRK
"Do what you can with him, Bones. ",KIRK
"Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. ",KIRK
If that's what you want. ,KIRK
Don't mention it. We're pleased to have caught you. Who are you? ,KIRK
"Spock, are you sure you're all right? ",MCCOY
"Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous insanity.",SPOCK
"It was a deep wound, Jim. He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover. ",MCCOY
"Status, are you still holding? ",KIRK
I think Mister Chekov's right. We are in a lot of trouble. ,MCCOY
"Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor. ",KIRK
"A fliwer, Captain. ",SPOCK
"But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you destroyed. Is there life aboard? ",KIRK
Explain. ,KIRK
"Captain, you're too close. ",SPOCK
"There is, of course, no escape for them, sir. ",SPOCK
What do you want? ,KIRK
"I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere. ",SPOCK
"The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let him attempt it. ",SPOCK
No. That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions continue. But there is no mind. ,MCCOY
"Jim, you can't  KIRK: Bones, this mess is our responsibility. You have your orders.",MCCOY
Rad. ,KIRK
"This is the Captain speaking. In our next action, we can risk neither miscalculation nor error  [Bridge]",KIRK
"An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship  KIRK: I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't feel it safe, Spock.",SPOCK
Impossible. It should have been destroyed instantly. ,KIRK
"Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely Doctor McCoy. ",KIRK
I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device. ,KIRK
"All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys! (takes the phaser back) ",KIRK
"Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone. ",SPOCK
"I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I plead with thee! I beg! ",SPOCK
We'll make a present of him to Melakon. ,KIRK
"That may not be easy, Jim. Medical analysis indicates the Troglytes are mentally inferior. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, can you get us some more light? ",KIRK
Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.,SPOCK
That is correct. ,MCCOY
The ship's Chief Medical Officer. ,MCCOY
Oh. ,KIRK
May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been rendered academic. The creature is now after us. ,SPOCK
"Approach course, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Spock, McCoy, follow my voice. Do you hear me? Keep following my voice. Spock. McCoy._ SPOCK: This must be it. ",KIRK
"Well, Mister Spock, do you have any ideas? ",KIRK
"I am honoured, Doctor. ",SPOCK
McCoy to Spock. ,MCCOY
"Confirmed, Captain, but it isn't possible. That ship is dead.",SPOCK
Launch shuttlecraft. ,KIRK
"I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it.",MCCOY
"I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles. ",KIRK
"You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor? ",KIRK
Where are you going? ,KIRK
"Yes, we could act as a midwife giving birth to a star. Then we would have two novas in the same position and theoretically return home. ",KIRK
Message from the captain.,SPOCK
"Deflectors on, Mister Farrell. ",KIRK
"You're not staying, McCoy. No matter what he tries to  (Prostrate on the floor.) ",KIRK
I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating.,KIRK
"Yes, Lieutenant, what is it? ",KIRK
"Definitely drugged, almost comatose. ",MCCOY
Do you know what you're saying? ,KIRK
"Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I am only a Vulcan. There are limits. ",SPOCK
Who are you? ,KIRK
Number of enemy forces. ,SPOCK
"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan.",KIRK
"Continue the alert, Lieutenant.",KIRK
(answers communicator) Kirk here. ,KIRK
Good. I think you'll find the orbit lock is broken as well. Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary. ,KIRK
"And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon.",SPOCK
This is Captain Kirk. Hold your fire. We have your commander aboard. ,KIRK
Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves? ,MCCOY
"What would you have me say, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health. A fringe benefit left over by the spores.",MCCOY
"Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880. ",SPOCK
"Your analysis, Spock. What is it? ",KIRK
There are over four hundred guys there. ,KIRK
Is it possible for Spock to return to Vulcan and repair the timeline that has been broken so all is the same as before? ,KIRK
"The whole episode was pretty hazy, Jim. I never really knew what happened. ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Landru. ,KIRK
"I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain. ",SPOCK
It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it is pursuing us. (The viewscreen now shows it head-on. A round opening with a small sun partway down the gullet.) ,SPOCK
"Even if you do, I can't restore it. I don't have the medical technique. ",MCCOY
We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help.,KIRK
"It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora.",SPOCK
I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.,SPOCK
Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control. ,SPOCK
The first thing we're going to do is get you back to the Enterprise. ,MCCOY
You require? Who and what are we? ,KIRK
"No, we're not. Let's go. ",KIRK
"A Horta. A Horta! Mister Spock, we need that retardation mechanism. You must re-establish communications with it. ",KIRK
Phasers on stun. Fire. (no effect) ,KIRK
"Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us. ",SPOCK
Disengage this computer now. ,KIRK
Release Chekov. Confine him to quarters. ,KIRK
"Will you check your automatic scanner, please? ",SPOCK
Wrong assumption. ,KIRK
Any patrols? ,KIRK
Bones? ,KIRK
McCoy here. ,MCCOY
No. ,KIRK
"The creature. It kills. It needs salt to live. Bones, move aside.",KIRK
"Mister Spock, explanation. ",KIRK
"So did they. Mister Chekov, take over.",KIRK
"We know very little about them. Their civilisation is advanced. They've had space flight for several centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system.",SPOCK
There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two. ,SPOCK
"How do I know? I could have made a thousand mistakes. Sealing nerve endings, joining ganglia. The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know. ",MCCOY
"If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive. ",SPOCK
"Well, we took the risk, Doctor. ",KIRK
"If so, it is the first ever discovered. An important historical find. ",SPOCK
Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders. Spock out. ,SPOCK
Report. ,KIRK
May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our destination. ,SPOCK
"Forget it, Spock. It won't work. ",MCCOY
"Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Starfleet's been trying for six months. If he's alive, isn't it unlikely that he'd receive us now? ",MCCOY
No. ,MCCOY
"You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew. ",SPOCK
"Drop it! (he fires, Brown falls straight backwards and the big figure bursts in and lifts Kirk off his feet. Chapel screams as she sees the hole in Brown reveals electronic parts)",KIRK
Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size.,SPOCK
They are safe because we are now exhibits in a zoo. ,SPOCK
Help him. Don't be afraid to help him. ,MCCOY
Indeed. ,SPOCK
"Yes, but, my dear, if he doesn't want you and he has asked you to forget him, then I suggest you take that as an honest concern for you and do it. Forget Winston. ",MCCOY
Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake? ,SPOCK
And what if we should decide against you? ,MCCOY
"Well, something like Melenex might do the trick. Brief unconsciousness and temporary skin discolouration. It looks worse than it is. ",MCCOY
Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them. ,SPOCK
"An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain. ",SPOCK
Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down to planet six. ,KIRK
There it is again. A flapping sound. (it goes dark) Agmar! ,KIRK
"Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov? ",KIRK
"Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians. ",SPOCK
"Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons.",SPOCK
Then I need a drink. ,MCCOY
How'd this beast get aboard my ship? ,KIRK
The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you. ,SPOCK
"All right, Zeon pigs, move. (He stumbles against the Nazi.) Zeon pigs. They do nothing right. Don't worry. They're on their way to the laboratory, for experimental work. They'll pay. Move! ",KIRK
I'm tired. ,KIRK
Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range. ,KIRK
"Oh! Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too. You never give up hoping, do you? ",MCCOY
And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. ,SPOCK
"Well now, it's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila. ",MCCOY
"I am not insensitive to it, Captain. ",SPOCK
Miramanee. Come here. Miramanee. ,KIRK
"If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying. ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, change course to seventeen mark four, warp factor three. ",KIRK
"Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands. ",SPOCK
Stand-by alert. ,KIRK
"Suffering, in torment and pain. Labouring without end. ",MCCOY
"Captain Kirk, come in please. ",SPOCK
I don't think your parents liked it very much either. ,KIRK
Captain here. ,KIRK
"Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain. ",SPOCK
Eminently practical. ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott. Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others. One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient. Captain Kirk, out. Prepare to beam aboard.",KIRK
Totally unfamiliar. ,SPOCK
Did you destroy the Malurian system? ,KIRK
I know it's there. McCoy put it in. There. Do you have the figures computed? ,KIRK
"I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening, gentlemen. ",SPOCK
I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab. They're both in extreme pain.,MCCOY
"Now, Scotty. Have medics stand by. ",MCCOY
"Engines astern, full speed.",KIRK
Phasers. ,KIRK
"Jim, Edith Keeler must die. ",SPOCK
"We come from a place that's quite some journey from here. I doubt if you've heard  FLAVIUS: Uniforms. Probably some new Praetorian guard unit. I should kill you here, but Septimus would probably be displeased. Move. Move! ",KIRK
Scotty!,KIRK
"You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law. ",KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must master it. I must control. ",SPOCK
Specify. ,KIRK
"Rayburn, maintain post here. ",KIRK
"(spotting shelves of discs) Captain. Intelligence files. Their banks contain the total knowledge of the Fabrini, ready for the people to consult when they arrive at their destination. (scans them) And they seem to have amassed a great deal of medical knowledge.",SPOCK
Mister Sulu. Get below. Take command of Engineering and auxiliary control. ,KIRK
"Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain. Quite large. ",SPOCK
McCoy. ,KIRK
"I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain. ",SPOCK
Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.,KIRK
"In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer. ",SPOCK
I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log.,MCCOY
Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering. ,KIRK
"None of us will do it, Galt. ",KIRK
"Scotty, beam us directly to Seven's apartment. ",KIRK
"No. It must be held by the magnetic force of the dead star, and it needs a starship to break free and a crew to man it. ",KIRK
"Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction. ",SPOCK
"I believe they are all immobilised, Captain. ",SPOCK
"What did he mean, we're not to give ourselves away? Can't they detect the ship up here? ",MCCOY
"Captain, were you inside this structure? ",SPOCK
You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders. My orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian customs. ,KIRK
Flash the Bridge. Put all decks on the alert.,KIRK
"Well, say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative powers ditto. As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch. Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of that wound on his forehead. Not even a bruise. It was like he had never been injured. ",MCCOY
"No, no. No, I never eat until the crew eats.",MCCOY
The ships look like they never got off the ground. Could be the disease Keniclius accidentally brought here swept the planet before they could do whatever they were going to do. ,MCCOY
"Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power. ",KIRK
No. A lover. Companion. It is wrong to keep us here against our will. ,KIRK
"He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him. ",MCCOY
"There's no question about his guilt, Captain, but does our involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive? ",SPOCK
That's paradise? ,KIRK
"Yes, for the worse.",MCCOY
"Are you a slave, Flavius? ",KIRK
Benecia Colony. ,KIRK
There is no such word in the linguistics bank? ,SPOCK
"Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any comment about those ears? ",MCCOY
"Well, some are off and some aren't. It has to be our error. Come on. We'll start from the beginning and this time we're going to find the answer. ",MCCOY
Mister Chekov. ,KIRK
They seem to be gorged. ,SPOCK
"Yes. Open a channel, Uhura.",KIRK
"Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come? ",KIRK
"Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view, leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction. ",SPOCK
Make your point. ,KIRK
"Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us. Specifically, our future. ",SPOCK
"You have fifteen minutes, Scotty.",KIRK
What neutralising operation? ,KIRK
"You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough. ",KIRK
Zero eight three. ,MCCOY
Then I'm unable to discern your problem. ,SPOCK
"These are strange aliens we're fighting. Scotty, as soon as we beam down, I want you to leave orbit. If they think we've gone, they won't be scanning the surface. Give us thirty minutes. ",KIRK
Eighteen years. ,SPOCK
"Prepare the arrest report, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
So?,MCCOY
I do not desire the captaincy. I much prefer my scientific duties. I am frankly content to be a lesser target. ,SPOCK
Who is it? ,KIRK
"Yes. He had been at the Academy for an unusually long time as an instructor. As a result, he was late in being assigned to a starship. The delay, he felt, looked bad on his record. My action, he believed, made things worse. ",KIRK
Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?,SPOCK
What? ,MCCOY
"No, I think you and I can handle it. Why don't you beam up now? ",KIRK
And you are to be her teacher? ,KIRK
Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age. ,MCCOY
"I'll tell you what you found. Nothing, right?",KIRK
"I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared. ",SPOCK
"Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain? ",SPOCK
Bones? (sees another skeleton chained to the wall) Doc? ,KIRK
"Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that they will be believed. ",KIRK
May I have your permission to go? ,KIRK
"I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir.",SPOCK
Let's see if it'll give way. Ahead half speed.,KIRK
"He should be beamed aboard, Jim. He needs more than I can do for him here. ",MCCOY
Here it comes. Is it raise or call?,KIRK
"Which means our weapons are useless, and we have no alternative but to go back down there and try to rescue Spock without them. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
In a hurry to see me go? ,KIRK
Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four. ,KIRK
What does it look like? ,KIRK
"I shall make an attempt, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Bob, where's Katie? ",KIRK
"Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and communications under repair. Random chance seems to have operated in our favour. ",SPOCK
I couldn't have prescribed better. We are one weary ship.,MCCOY
"Be sensible, Doctor. ",KIRK
"Ahead warp factor three, Mister Sulu. Colony Beta Six wants their supplies. Let's get across this void in a hurry. ",KIRK
Why is that unusual? They want to get out of here as much as we do. ,KIRK
"I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised. ",SPOCK
"A religious leader, was he not? ",KIRK
"Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main power banks. ",KIRK
"Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends? ",KIRK
Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay. ,KIRK
"Override systems, Mister Spock. Open the core hatch. ",KIRK
Why have we been repeatedly attacked and are now being held prisoner by a planet known for its hospitality? ,KIRK
"Can I help you, friend? ",MCCOY
"Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your first citizen? ",SPOCK
Better rig a by-pass circuit. ,SPOCK
"Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here. Only answering your charges against me will force me back. ",KIRK
"Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain. ",SPOCK
You're two of a kind. ,KIRK
"Yeoman. (picks the pen up) You have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker? ",KIRK
"In the beginning perhaps. But later, I wanted it to be more than that. ",KIRK
Scotty? ,KIRK
Irritation? ,SPOCK
"And you, are you feeling all right? ",KIRK
"Scotty, put a tractor beam on it. We'll take it in tow. ",KIRK
"Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder. ",SPOCK
Have you seen any strangers among the villagers? ,MCCOY
We don't want any trouble. We'll be glad to co-operate. ,KIRK
The opening where we were drawn in seems to have closed. But there's another opening up there on top. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, how long until the alien vessel makes contact with the Beta Niobe nova? ",KIRK
"Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you? ",KIRK
What's he doing to my crew? ,KIRK
DO you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man to do that. ,KIRK
"I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I find out anything, I'll let you know. (leaves) ",MCCOY
I said I haven't decided. ,KIRK
Captain Kirk. ,SPOCK
(looking at McCoy) I doubt if he'll get very far. He feels ill. ,KIRK
We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach. ,SPOCK
What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into some kind of poetry. ,MCCOY
"Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous.",SPOCK
Incredible. They're destroyed on contact with the matter this thing takes in and then they regenerate immediately. ,KIRK
All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles. ,MCCOY
"She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister Spock?",KIRK
Who are you? ,KIRK
"On my way. Lazarus, you're with me. Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh. ",KIRK
"To us, perhaps, but to the computer? ",SPOCK
May I have the pleasure? ,KIRK
"Lazarus, are you all right? ",KIRK
Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos.",SPOCK
Or a deep psychosis. ,SPOCK
I presume my calculations are correct. ,SPOCK
The phaser bore can cut through twenty metres of rock per minute.,KIRK
The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of this.,SPOCK
Did you say I'm a man of curious habits? Jim's talking to a table. ,MCCOY
"Naturally, since he did not come from there. ",SPOCK
There's an intruder aboard. Has someone tried to gain entrance there? ,KIRK
Long ago. Of course. Long ago.,MCCOY
"There'll only be one of you in the end. One jealous god. if all this makes a god, or is it making you something else? ",KIRK
"Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our action.  ",KIRK
Sam Cogley had gone a shore to bring Jamie Finney on board.,KIRK
And we are still increasing speed. Contact with the nova in thirty five point one eight seconds. ,SPOCK
"A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating? ",KIRK
Your hat. ,KIRK
Does everybody know about this wheat but me? ,KIRK
Key in the ignition. Turn the ignition on. And nothing happens.,KIRK
"No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain. ",SPOCK
"As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back.",KIRK
"You mean you want us to co-operate with those  KIRK: If we want to get out of here, it's our only choice. ",MCCOY
"Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body. ",SPOCK
"Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere? ",SPOCK
What? ,KIRK
This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts.,KIRK
"That refers to a living, growing culture. Do you think this one is? ",KIRK
"Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you are! How wonderful for you. If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back. ",KIRK
Is that the end of it? ,KIRK
"You can't stay here. You can't survive without the spores. After you've cleared at the Starbase, you could be relocated. It depends upon what you want. ",MCCOY
"Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty? ",KIRK
"Yes, sir, there was._ COGLEY: Please tell us about it. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus? ",KIRK
What purpose will it serve to die? ,KIRK
I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five. ,SPOCK
Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven. ,SPOCK
The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter. ,SPOCK
Well. ,MCCOY
"I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question. ",SPOCK
General Trelane. ,KIRK
I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have had the opposite effect. ,KIRK
"Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Where's your wife, Professor? ",KIRK
With all due gratitude. ,KIRK
The women!,SPOCK
Alert status. ,KIRK
He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed back faster. He didn't become as weak. ,SPOCK
I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back. ,KIRK
Lock on to Captain Kirk's co-ordinates  [Transporter room],SPOCK
"Yes, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. ",SPOCK
"I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen. I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it. I want another answer. I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me. I want that third alternative. ",KIRK
Where?,KIRK
"Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked. ",SPOCK
"Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain. ,KIRK
Are your faces alike? Can you tell from them which of you is good and which of you is evil? ,KIRK
Spock. ,SPOCK
The weight of three grown men. ,SPOCK
Haven't you found a thing yet? ,KIRK
We came nowhere near Romulan territory. I deny all charges and plan to file a detailed complaint with the Federation. ,KIRK
Incredible. It is him. ,MCCOY
"All right, Jim.",MCCOY
"Stand by. Mister Chekov, do you wish to attend? ",KIRK
"We might be able to divert the lava flow with a barricade. Tchar, get us a visual estimate! ",KIRK
"I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost human pattern. ",SPOCK
"Jim, I didn't realise how many of the tools I use in Sickbay were designed by Sarah. ",MCCOY
"Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped ourselves. ",SPOCK
Explanation. ,KIRK
"Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates. ",SPOCK
"Mister Arex, what is our speed? ",KIRK
"Yes, Spock. Sit down. We've arranged a rendezvous to pick up the drug you need. ",KIRK
"Spock, I  SPOCK: Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel. ",MCCOY
"I see. You mean, we're the bait. ",KIRK
"Good night, Jim. ",MCCOY
What's that? ,KIRK
"You heard the man, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
"Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device. ",SPOCK
"Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl? ",MCCOY
"Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically non-existent._ KIRK: (goes to the door) Hanar? Hanar. ",MCCOY
The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain. ,SPOCK
"Captain, are you beaming down?",MCCOY
"Hyperacceleration is the key. I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration. They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me. Presumably, this is enslavement? Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile eventually. But when  DEELA: Damaged. ",KIRK
Let's find out. Phasers on stun. ,KIRK
Maintain Red Alert. ,KIRK
"As a matter of fact, I do, but this is not one of them. Look at this. (a pair of large tracks in the soil) I saw what I saw, or maybe I hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you think about it. ",MCCOY
"They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?",KIRK
"Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Galway, assume your position. Start your duties. ",KIRK
"There must be something to do, something I've overlooked.",KIRK
You say you're convinced he knows what it is? ,KIRK
That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring? ,KIRK
"Not now, Leslie. Lieutenant, contact the space station. ",KIRK
"Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I should think interesting would suffice. ",SPOCK
That devours all life and light. ,MCCOY
"Hang on, Scotty. Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts. I'll be right down.",KIRK
(holds her) We're all frightened. (Miri leaves) ,KIRK
"Jim, if that's true, we're all in trouble. Jim, do something. ",MCCOY
"There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only one way to really experience it. ",SPOCK
"We could use some more, if you don't mind. ",KIRK
"That thing out there has ionized this complete sector. None of our instruments work. At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity. And out there somewhere, a twenty four foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control. Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play. ",KIRK
Where did it come from? ,MCCOY
"Bones, what about it? ",KIRK
"Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see. ",SPOCK
Just testing. Be in touch with you later. ,KIRK
The danger to you is Korby. ,KIRK
Look at him. ,KIRK
Did you hear something? ,KIRK
"We'll both look, Mister Atoz.",KIRK
"Well, we'd better get to the control room. ",MCCOY
Perhaps. But then two Doctor McCoys just might bring the level of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels. ,SPOCK
"Yes. Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over. That was a rough beam-up. ",KIRK
Define. ,SPOCK
Excuse me. Kirk here. ,KIRK
She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him. ,KIRK
Excuse me. ,KIRK
"Reverse course, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. ",SPOCK
"Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign. ",KIRK
"I know, and I thank you. I have to go and change. You ready? ",KIRK
Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here. ,MCCOY
That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth. ,KIRK
"What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No problems, no command decisions. Just living. ",KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the Academy. One of the finest men I ever knew. I could have killed that thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time. ,KIRK
What happened?,KIRK
"There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash. ",SPOCK
"I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the ship. ",SPOCK
"Very astute, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"Are we sure, Jim? A number of the crew are acting as strange as Spock. ",MCCOY
"I shall be honoured, sir. ",MCCOY
You seem to think this Companion of yours can do almost anything. ,KIRK
"Mister Chekov, plot course to intercept that vessel. I want to see what she looks like close up. ",KIRK
We can't wait for those communicators any longer. ,MCCOY
"Thank you, Mister Arex. Since we appear to have only one way out, we're going to take it. Mister Sulu, takes us to that central core area. ",KIRK
"Sord, what did you think you saw back there? ",SPOCK
We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister Scott can maintain power. ,SPOCK
We've got to get out of here. ,KIRK
The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador. ,MCCOY
What were their symptoms?,KIRK
These clothes. We stole them. We didn't have any money. ,KIRK
The trial may be academic. ,SPOCK
"Now look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax. You co-operate with us and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action. ",KIRK
Right now. ,MCCOY
"I'm sorry, Captain. I've tried everything I can. Variant radiation, intense heat, even as great as nine thousand degrees. ",MCCOY
With whom are you at war? ,SPOCK
I could make a device to deliver it on target. ,SPOCK
Spock. (he wakes) Doctor McCoy. Bones. Bones? ,KIRK
How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse engines directly. ,SPOCK
I was. ,SPOCK
You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to? ,KIRK
Look ahead. ,KIRK
"Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than that. ",MCCOY
There was a call for you from the Bridge. ,MCCOY
Why do you ask? ,SPOCK
"Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice? ",KIRK
I'm not sure I can take too much of this. ,MCCOY
"Bones, what is it? Answer me! ",KIRK
I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators? ,KIRK
"Both your arguments seem sound. Go ahead, Bones. ",KIRK
Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the room. Doctor Adams explained  [Sickbay],KIRK
"Try to contact her, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
"Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven. ",SPOCK
"We are up to warp twenty two and increasing, Captain. We shall have forty two point eight five seconds to correct our course after the alien ship enters the nova. ",SPOCK
You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered girl. ,KIRK
"Yes, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
He's an android like Brown? ,KIRK
There's no serum! There are no miracles! There's no immortality here! All this is for nothing! ,KIRK
Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action. ,SPOCK
"Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. ",SPOCK
"Clear, Captain. ",SPOCK
"The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister President. ",KIRK
"Force field is now off, Captain. ",SPOCK
You mean there'll be two of those things? ,KIRK
"You exaggerate, Nurse. Kindly see that your medical summary is more precise. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Scotty, what is it? ",KIRK
I am not capable of that emotion. ,SPOCK
Nona.,KIRK
"Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.",SPOCK
Be careful. I would not want you to drop it. ,SPOCK
"Fine. Yes, Chief. Kirk here. ",KIRK
Then we could be dealing with the basis of all those legends. A space traveller who visited Earth in primitive times. ,KIRK
"You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian?",KIRK
"Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer.",SPOCK
"It appears to be a legitimate fog. Perhaps the humidification system is  KIRK: Here, Spock. Whoops! ",SPOCK
Even if he shouldn't. ,SPOCK
Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them. ,SPOCK
Perfectly all right. Where are you? ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Spock to Captain Kirk. ,SPOCK
Fair? (leaves) ,KIRK
The ryetalyn. ,MCCOY
"I would find it most interesting, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Hunting's good. We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump them outside. ",KIRK
"Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum  OXMYX: I ain't interested in your orders. From now on, you're gonna take orders from me. I'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things I want. If I don't have those tools by then, I'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in a box. Is that understood, pal? ",KIRK
"Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker. ",SPOCK
Miramanee! No! Miramanee! ,KIRK
Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning. ,KIRK
Ready. ,SPOCK
Use the robot ship as a decoy. Have it change course and move off. We'll use it again to give the Klingons trouble. They can't control more than one ship at a time with their stasis field. ,KIRK
"You've found the antidote, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"What coincidence? We used to pull stunts like this in medical school with trick glasses. Don't look now, but we've got a practical joker in our midst. ",MCCOY
"I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu, at your signal. Let's get back to our posts. Keep me advised. ",KIRK
"Here, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Spock, try and make contact. ",KIRK
"Please restrict your movements, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command. ",SPOCK
That's what I would have done. ,KIRK
"For what, sir? ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Vanderberg. We'll need your complete co-operation. ",KIRK
Energise. ,SPOCK
"Well, what are we waiting for, Mister Spock? We're not diplomats. ",MCCOY
How did Riley get in there?,KIRK
I almost envy you your assignment. ,SPOCK
"No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"What happened, Mister Spock? ",MCCOY
"Engage, Mister Sulu. Quarter speed.",KIRK
"It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it. ",KIRK
"Reverse the machine, Keniclius. ",KIRK
"Explanation, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Spock, Bones, come with us. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the odds on our getting out of here? ",KIRK
"Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced. ",SPOCK
That's an answer.  ,MCCOY
Strange that such a highly developed race would be violent. ,KIRK
"Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. ",SPOCK
"If this doesn't work, we could lose you and Spock. ",MCCOY
That's impossible. ,KIRK
"Very good. Time, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
"Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base. ",SPOCK
Interesting design. ,KIRK
"Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born! ",MCCOY
All do. The cave is deep in our memory. ,KIRK
I want those phasers and communicators now. ,KIRK
"Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the death? ",KIRK
Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be no error. ,MCCOY
That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence. ,SPOCK
I'll hang on to it. The fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy.,KIRK
"All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice. ",KIRK
Oh? I thought it was my idea. ,KIRK
Salt tablets. ,MCCOY
At what age did you become a starship captain? And when did you enter Starfleet Academy? ,SPOCK
A statistical probability. ,SPOCK
The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question. ,KIRK
Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress. ,SPOCK
"Do what you can, Bones. ",KIRK
However? ,KIRK
Do something. ,MCCOY
"Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare. Kang has got to listen.",KIRK
Because they may not be dead. We have to find out. ,KIRK
I have orders to the contrary. This is not a passenger ship. ,KIRK
"Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn. ",KIRK
Ben. Why kill innocent people? ,KIRK
A feeling is not much to go on. ,SPOCK
"If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him. ",KIRK
Mister Spock here.,SPOCK
"Chekov, give me a hand. ",MCCOY
Energise. ,KIRK
"Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years. ",SPOCK
"I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures. Mister Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields. ",SPOCK
We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only circumstantial. ,KIRK
"His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain. ",SPOCK
How long have you been aboard the Enterprise? ,KIRK
Three against three. We may never get a better chance. ,KIRK
Where is Mister Spock? ,KIRK
"On audio, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
This new Klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it can immobilize a starship. The energy drain on the Klingon ship would be enormous. ,SPOCK
"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help. ",KIRK
"If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's a chance that he'll be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him. ",KIRK
"Unfortunately, he wasn't the first. ",MCCOY
The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago. ,SPOCK
What happened to them? ,MCCOY
"Jim, what kind of power must she have? ",MCCOY
There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets. Jim. ,MCCOY
I've got command. I've got command. I've got command. ,KIRK
(reading) Intermediate experimentation report project on life prolongation. ,KIRK
"After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting. ",MCCOY
"Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he can change. Maybe he wants to change his image. ",KIRK
"Agreed. Once they've got it into their heads we're showing force, you can forget them signing any mining treaty. ",MCCOY
These things cannot be real. Hallucinations can't harm us. Go back to where you were. ,MCCOY
"Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector? ",KIRK
"Give him the countersign, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Fine, but what power, and where is it? Scout around with your tricorders. Find the source of that power. Bones. ",KIRK
"A practical idea, Captain. It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you. ",SPOCK
Thank you. Chief Medical Officer Doctor McCoy. ,KIRK
I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.,KIRK
Good. Mister DePaul. ,KIRK
He lied. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. Remember that.,KIRK
"Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult. ",SPOCK
"Bones, it wasn't your fault. ",KIRK
There's really something I don't understand about all of this.,KIRK
Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity. ,KIRK
"You don't think so, what? ",KIRK
Captain. ,SPOCK
"Put it on audio, Lieutenant Uhura. ",KIRK
"Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened. ",KIRK
"I don't think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere, however a planet is evolving. ",KIRK
"You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way. ",KIRK
Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to become fully conscious she'll know what has happened. ,KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment? ,KIRK
Just like Compton.,MCCOY
"You're planning something, Captain? ",SPOCK
It's that green blood of his. ,MCCOY
"Follow your instructions, Nomad. ",KIRK
"You Vulcans are the most impossible, unimaginative  KIRK: Bones, that's not helping the situation. ",MCCOY
All right. Did the Platonians always have this power? ,KIRK
Which is? ,KIRK
We need more venom. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news? ",KIRK
Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y three X point zero zero four. And I could use a second blood analyser unit.,MCCOY
I am ready. ,SPOCK
Gas all decks but this one. ,KIRK
"We'll tell you what we decide to tell you in a few moments. In the meantime, relax. You're our guest. I have a feeling you'll find it interesting. ",KIRK

What's wrong with her? ,KIRK
What do you want from me? ,KIRK
You used the transporter? ,KIRK
"Yes, go on. ",KIRK
Cat and mouse game. ,SPOCK
Are you responsible for stopping the ship? ,KIRK
Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the chromosomes. We must destroy that organism. ,KIRK
"I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma. ",SPOCK
"My pleasure, Captain. ",SPOCK
And now  KHAN: Khan is my name. ,KIRK
And there are guards every few feet down the hall. ,KIRK
"First, Bones, the ingredients you require. ",KIRK
No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison. ,SPOCK
Your parents. Where are they? Your mother and father. ,KIRK
"Now, Mister Sulu! ",KIRK
We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go. ,MCCOY
Their descendants? ,KIRK
"In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah, Miranda. There you are.",SPOCK
"He's dead, Jim. ",MCCOY
Spock. ,KIRK
"Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Trelane, we haven't planned  TRELANE: Tut tut. Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem. Quite the contrary. I have nothing but admiration for your whole species. ",KIRK
Beauty survives.  ,KIRK

"You have one minute to restore my Bridge crew unharmed, or you will undergo full barrage. ",KIRK
"No, sir. Silicon. ",SPOCK
"Don't worry, Bon. She'll be all right. Goodbye. ",KIRK
"Commander Bem, if you could split yourself into separate parts, why didn't you escape on your own earlier? ",KIRK
"Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they achieve exactly the same results.",SPOCK
"Oh, yes. So you are. Well, girls, I suppose you can turn something up.",MCCOY
"Helen described  PIPER: She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.",KIRK
"If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.",KIRK
But you said that was impossible. ,MCCOY
And it is not yet our time. ,SPOCK
Sulu! ,MCCOY
I endeavour to be accurate. ,SPOCK
What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've checked everywhere. ,MCCOY
"I know that. But I've never known Spock to act like a pal under any circumstances, least of all toward Klingons. ",MCCOY
Many of us live on the things you consume. ,SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?",KIRK
Nothing of importance. Fatigue perhaps. ,KIRK
But they'll be looking for us. ,MCCOY
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction. ,SPOCK
A room should reflect its occupant. ,KIRK
"You don't have a schedule now, do you? ",KIRK
"Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't love her, but I do love her. And she loves me. ",KIRK
I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy. ,KIRK
"Good. Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload? ",KIRK
"I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock? ",KIRK
"Trick or treat, Captain? ",SPOCK
It came from back there. ,KIRK
Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?,SPOCK
What did the others die of? ,KIRK
Wait a minute. There is a method to this madness. ,KIRK
I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in. It's unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a galaxy away. What are the odds on such duplication? ,KIRK
Either of you hurt? ,KIRK
"All right, you want a foolie? All right. I dare you, I double-dare you. Look at the blood on my face. Now look at your hands.",KIRK
"Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already.",KIRK
I can't risk beaming you down there until I know what kind of reception you're going to receive. Your safety is my responsibility.,KIRK
"Spock, I'll get the cloaking device. Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention? ",KIRK
True. ,SPOCK
Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom's right. I can do a lot of other things. Am I afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm fighting it? Am I that petty? ,KIRK
"I think it's after you, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain. ",SPOCK
You. ,KIRK
"Engineering, cut power on starboard side. Maintain until further orders. Chekov. ",KIRK
"You're running a big risk, Spock. ",KIRK
"Listen to me. I'm going to come into your thoughts. And at the same time, you will come into mine. ",SPOCK
"Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the distress call. Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now? ",KIRK
"Matt. Matt, it's Jim Kirk. ",KIRK
But you haven't won anything. ,KIRK
Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov.,SPOCK
How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met? ,KIRK
Certainly. Has the Enterprise been released yet? ,KIRK
"Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?",SPOCK
"Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds. ",SPOCK
"Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary. ",SPOCK
"Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly. ",MCCOY
Are you getting a reading on them? ,KIRK
"You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there  COMMANDER: Captain, if a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation, what would a starbase commander do?",KIRK
"Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable. ",SPOCK
"This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander, Captain Christopher Pike.",SPOCK
The girl on the viewscreen. ,KIRK
I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several weeks. ,SPOCK
That's different. Marvick loved her. ,MCCOY
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received. ,SPOCK
I asked you first. ,KIRK
"The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant, which seems to be quite a time saver. ",MCCOY
"Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately. ",MCCOY
"Scotty, energise. ",KIRK
What happens if we get him out of there? ,KIRK
"It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time. ",SPOCK
Must have been some accident to get almost every pod. ,MCCOY
There used to be a story about a modern Diogenes wandering the galaxy looking for someone special. ,MCCOY
Ayelborne! ,KIRK
"Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game you're playing  ANAN: This is no game, Captain. Half a million people have just been killed. Activate the attack units, Sar. ",KIRK
We do not know that Lokai has done that. ,SPOCK
"It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now.  ",KIRK
No apparent opening. ,KIRK
What about the Captain?,MCCOY
"Sorry, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Ah, now that's more like it. Shall we? ",MCCOY
"As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two years ago. ",SPOCK
"Garth, you have only a handful of men. ",KIRK
"Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests.",MCCOY
There were replicas of one of them. But that power to recreate them has been destroyed. ,KIRK
The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony. ,SPOCK
No sign of present life? ,KIRK
She's not through yet.,KIRK
"Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes. ",KIRK
"You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display. ",KIRK
"Get out of the way. (McCoy and Kirk struggle for the phaser while Nancy grabs and eats the salt tablets. McCoy wins and is pushed away, then she transfixes Kirk and reaches for his face) ",KIRK
Cotton wadding. Try the apothecary. ,KIRK
Just where are you going? ,MCCOY
"Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us. We step on that deck, Spock is finished. Court-martialed, disgraced. ",KIRK
"Let's try for one hundred, Mister Spock.",KIRK
"Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men. We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit.",KIRK
The marriage party approaches. I hear them. ,SPOCK
"Enterprise to Orion vessel. I have a proposal to make. If you do have the Huron's cargo, there were some perishable drugs in it that we desperately need. ",KIRK
"Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon.",SPOCK
"So, we're all just fine, but whatever was on that ship used our transporter beam to come aboard with us, and now it's here. ",KIRK
Cortropine. Could help. It's a strong stimulant. ,MCCOY
"Stand by, Sulu. ",KIRK
"No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities. ",KIRK
"And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal chords. It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your oratory on Starbase Four. ",KIRK
"Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's your big chance. ",MCCOY
Try ship to ship. ,KIRK
What would you do in my place? ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers. ",KIRK
What if we are? ,KIRK
It's likely. ,KIRK
Close to Earth conditions. ,KIRK
Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death. ,KIRK
"No visual contact, Mister Kelso? ",KIRK
"Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they? ",MCCOY
"Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators. ",KIRK
And I'm getting normal function in all computer modes. That last pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects. ,SPOCK
I'm Captain Kirk. ,KIRK
"Where, Captain? ",SPOCK
What happens to Spock if I decline? ,KIRK
"In search of his brain, Doctor. From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him. ",KIRK
"We found John Gill. At least, we've seen him. He may be drugged, hypnotised, or psychotic. You'll have to make a determination. Hurry with that uniform. ",KIRK
Captain. ,MCCOY
None. ,MCCOY
"McCoy, get out of the way! ",KIRK
Please let them return to the ship. ,MCCOY
"Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty.",KIRK
I wish to talk to those in charge. ,KIRK
Fire. ,KIRK
"Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore  MCCOY: Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living. Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out. That's it, isn't it?",SPOCK
I see what you mean. ,KIRK
I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left. ,MCCOY
"Readings, Nurse. ",MCCOY
"Captain, I thought the plan  OTHER KIRK: I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock.",SPOCK
No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us reverse power. ",SPOCK
"And if this thing does have a stomach, we just might be able to give it enough indigestion to make it turn away from Mantilles. ",KIRK
"No, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist. ",KIRK
"What are the ship's sensors reading now, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
Diverting all secondary power to the shields. (McCoy enters) I'll continue communications as long as there is power to transmit. ,SPOCK
"Captain, the universe is safe. ",SPOCK
"Spock! If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow take Bones back a day in time, then  SPOCK: Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish  KIRK: Guardian. Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes? ",KIRK
"I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before. ",SPOCK
I've got something else in mind. Let's go. ,KIRK
But that blow on the head. It could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap. ,KIRK
"Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships.",KIRK
The necklace. ,SPOCK
"It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that section of the galaxy.",SPOCK

"Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there's a chance  SPOCK: I'll try. ",KIRK
I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise. ,KIRK
Consider all you could learn from the many species you might entertain without travelling the galaxy. ,SPOCK

"Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores? ",KIRK
"Yes, Scotty? What else? ",KIRK
"That's it. End of a long, hard journey. ",KIRK
Why? For what reason? Why all the mumbo-jumbo? ,KIRK
With regular pulsations of generated energy? ,KIRK
McCoy here. I'll call you soon as I know anything. Sickbay out. ,MCCOY
"We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed. Or that they're not prepared for a general war. Open a hailing frequency. ",KIRK
"Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance. ",SPOCK
"The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's the way Daystrom put it. ",MCCOY

"No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not. ",MCCOY
Meet me there on the double.,KIRK
"No, no, no. All right, all right, all right. We don't want any trouble. ",KIRK
That should prove very interesting. ,SPOCK
What is it? ,KIRK
What happened here? Where is everybody? ,KIRK
"Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud. ",SPOCK
Please. ,KIRK
I swear that's honeysuckle I smell. ,MCCOY
I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk. ,SPOCK
Gentlemen. ,KIRK
"Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin. ",MCCOY

I don't know. ,MCCOY
"Your agoniser, please. ",SPOCK
Morning. (drags Christopher along) Captain. ,KIRK
Sulu had the same observation. Any explanations? ,KIRK
"Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body, Captain. However. ",SPOCK
"Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu, explain. ",KIRK
"Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you. ",SPOCK
"Lazarus! You stay here. All personnel, security red. ",KIRK
"And truant officers, I presume. ",MCCOY
"Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three. ",SPOCK
"We shall soon see, Lieutenant. ",SPOCK
I would like to speak to someone in authority. ,KIRK
"Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
You've shown friendship by handing over our weapons. She's making a gesture in return. ,MCCOY
I beg your pardon? ,KIRK
"Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field. ",SPOCK
Who's interfering? We're taking over. Check? ,KIRK
"Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill? ",KIRK
I will destroy it. ,KIRK
Bones! ,KIRK
Doctor McCoy saved your life. ,KIRK
"It's not the transporter. It's you. You know what the future looks like. If anybody else finds out, they could change the course of it, destroy it. ",KIRK
"Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work of duplication. ",SPOCK
"He thrives on love, worship, attention. ",KIRK
It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"If you want to play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your business, but you're no god to us, Mister. ",KIRK

Such restraint would be welcome. ,SPOCK
You admit that? ,MCCOY

"No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft. ",KIRK

Can you feel that? ,KIRK
What thing? What was it? ,KIRK
Mister Spock? ,KIRK
There's no such thing as a safe tribble. ,MCCOY
"Not at all, Captain. ",SPOCK
"I'm Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise. This is my first officer, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
You mean they should have respected us? ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, do you mind if I take one of these down to the lab to see what makes it tick? ",MCCOY
"We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves. We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels, Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds. Just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time. ",KIRK
"(reading a clipboard) The alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo Command Headquarters. Well, that takes care of the phasers. ",KIRK
"Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know a little place across town where the women  MCCOY: Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go. ",KIRK
"Of course not. Anyway, it's just a fraction off normal. It's probably the instrument. They need to be recalibrated every so often. ",MCCOY
Surely there are better methods than this. ,KIRK
I'm sorry. I should've said Captain Garth. ,KIRK
"Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. ",SPOCK
And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons. ,SPOCK
Identification? ,KIRK
"Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual check of every scientific expedition is routine. ",SPOCK
Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.,MCCOY
Bypass that analysis. We've got twenty nine minutes before we're too small to operate ship controls. Everyone continue to jury-rig miniature control mechanisms. There's nothing more we can do. ,KIRK
"Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.",KIRK
All my senior officers turning against me? ,KIRK
"Yes, I know, Scotty. ",KIRK
You say your people built all this. Who are you? What planet are you from?,KIRK
"Septimus, we need your help. We must go into the city. We know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently. ",KIRK
Who have you come for? Form a circle. You see? You'd better tell us. Tell us. Who have you come for?,KIRK
"If we could only find the proper filtering agent, we might be able to solve this problem. Negative. It's the third failure. ",MCCOY

How did all this happen? ,KIRK

"Come, Doctor, back to bed. ",SPOCK
"It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them. ",SPOCK

There's nothing we can do about it. ,SPOCK

I believe you mean that. ,KIRK
"You  LANDRU: Landru, help me! ",KIRK
How does one obtain the power? ,SPOCK
"Ah. Mister Spock, check them out. ",KIRK
What's that? ,MCCOY
"Damage in communications, Captain.",SPOCK
I suggest we all concentrate on the medical kit. ,SPOCK
"Captain, the extreme long-range sensors show something in the Zone. At this distance, I cannot determine precisely what it is. It could be a trading vessel like Winston's. But it does not seem prudent to take the risk of trespass into the Zone. ",SPOCK
"One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult. ",MCCOY
"Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right? ",SPOCK
"Take a look around, Bones. ",KIRK

"A little time, he'll live. ",MCCOY

What is? ,KIRK
"Do we violate the treaty, Captain? ",MCCOY
"I'd love to oblige you, Mister Spock, but we're not all together. Besides, we have Apollo to deal with. ",KIRK
Come in. ,SPOCK
The beginnings of industrialisation. ,KIRK
What is that? ,KIRK
"Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked. ,SPOCK
Or of fear. ,KIRK
"We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. ",SPOCK

"No, I don't think you're stupid. I just think your behaviour is arrested. ",KIRK
Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?,KIRK
"Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. Enterprise, come in. Mister Spock, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty, where's that power? ",KIRK
"And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too. ",KIRK
"Yes. I want to protect her, hold her in my arms. ",SPOCK
Let's see them. ,KIRK
Why not? ,KIRK
"I don't think so, Doctor. ",SPOCK
"It's definite, Mister Sulu. The intruder can assume any shape.",KIRK

Something wrong? ,SPOCK
Now this isn't going to hurt a bit. ,MCCOY
"They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.",SPOCK
Has such an order ever included his senior officers? ,SPOCK

Electronically sophisticated devices. I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there. ,SPOCK

Is he the thing that attacked you? ,KIRK

I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock?,KIRK

"Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy. ",SPOCK

"Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference. ",SPOCK
"You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation? ",MCCOY
Put him in isolation. ,KIRK
"You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere.",KIRK
All right. Take D'Amato's tricorder. Set it for automatic distress. You never can tell. ,KIRK
Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded. ,SPOCK
Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element. ,SPOCK
I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other. ,SPOCK
Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child. ,SPOCK
"This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You recall his name. ",SPOCK
Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be. ,KIRK
"Spock, run additional tricorder readings. Learn anything you can.",KIRK
That pyramid seems to be the centre of everything. I'm going up there. The rest of you spread out and circle it. ,KIRK
"It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings. ",SPOCK
That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her along. ,MCCOY

"I'm already on board, Spock. Do you have the information? ",KIRK
"Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report. ",KIRK
"No, my lady Amanda. Any child has much to learn. My young cousin has a more difficult road to travel than others. ",SPOCK
"Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful.",SPOCK
Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present situation. ,SPOCK
Occasionally. Why? ,KIRK
"Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun. Fire a burst in a one-block radius around these co-ordinates. ",KIRK
"It is possible, but the rewiring of the power leads is complex and time-consuming. ",SPOCK
Get to the Sickbay. ,KIRK
"We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we? ",KIRK
Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late. I don't see any tribbles around here. ,KIRK
Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.,MCCOY
"I read the book as a child, Mister Spock, but I wasn't aware you indulged in the literature of fantasy. ",KIRK
"I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you doing here?",KIRK
"Aiming at what, Mister Sulu? So far all source studies have shown the waves come from an area as large as one sixth the planet's surface.",KIRK
Our mission is to investigate. ,KIRK
It seems to be waiting. ,KIRK
"Engineer Scott as well. Unfortunately, I do not know where I am. ",SPOCK
"They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism. ",MCCOY
"I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for an examination. ",MCCOY

"The ship, our engines, our weapons. It's just inconceivable that we are immobilised.",MCCOY
"No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately. ",SPOCK
"No wonder the Morgs are so obedient, and terrified. ",KIRK
Did you get this at the space station? ,KIRK
Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos. ,SPOCK
Will you take us where we can find the Others? ,KIRK
It's still got us. ,MCCOY
"What is this? Everything's all messed up and changed around, out of place. ",MCCOY
"No more magic for us, Jim. It's all back there. You think Lucien really was the demon some men call Lucifer? ",MCCOY

I see no alternative. ,SPOCK
Not good. Severe shock. ,MCCOY

"Can you recognise this thing When you see it? Professor, I'll forego charges up to this point but this creature's aboard my ship and I'll have it, or I'll have your skin, or both. Now where is it? ",KIRK

Doctor.,KIRK
Bones. ,KIRK
It has not been tested. ,SPOCK
"No change, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works. ",KIRK
"Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time. ",KIRK
"Put up our present position, Lieutenant Arex. ",KIRK
Something's wrong. ,MCCOY
All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to stimulate the senses. ,KIRK
There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.,SPOCK
The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is unquestionably controlling it. ,SPOCK

All right. What do you want? ,KIRK
Okay so far. Sonic grenade? ,KIRK
The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of this star sector when it disappeared. ,KIRK

"Lucien, you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate humans. Why? ",SPOCK
"That is correct, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"That is very considerate of you, Doctor. ",SPOCK

"Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline. ",SPOCK
Correct it after you release control of my ship. ,KIRK
Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice. ,MCCOY
I still say it can get us killed. ,MCCOY
I do. And I stand by it. ,SPOCK

You wouldn't be standing here if I had. ,KIRK

"Now, Scotty! ",KIRK
Have you got something to say? ,KIRK
And Crewman Darnell. ,MCCOY
"Now. this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour. ",SPOCK
"He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found  KIRK: A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins. That man will go a shore on my orders. What's his name?",SPOCK
"Can we predict the same for you, Captain? ",SPOCK
We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will. ,KIRK
Or a tragic mistake on my part. ,MCCOY
"About your double, Captain. ",SPOCK
"You must help us. When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge. Yet, when we came here, you didn't. ",KIRK
"All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations.",KIRK
We must get to understand what is happening. ,KIRK
The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us.,SPOCK
Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my gratitude. Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you.,MCCOY
"Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir. ",KIRK
"Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get. ",SPOCK
I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact. ,MCCOY
Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind?,KIRK

Maybe. Heart beat dropping. ,MCCOY

Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful. ,SPOCK
He's fully immunised now. We all are. ,MCCOY
"Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot? ",KIRK
"Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to learn. ",KIRK
"Very well, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
Most peculiar. This indicates there is another stasis box circling Beta Lyrae. ,SPOCK
"It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves. ",KIRK
I didn't come to drink. ,KIRK
Come. ,KIRK
"Negative, Captain. Not living tissue. ",SPOCK
"I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar. ",SPOCK
Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report. ,KIRK
"But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to react like a human. ",SPOCK
What are you complaining about? It kept you alive. ,KIRK
Who are you? Who is Trelane? ,KIRK
"That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply. ",SPOCK
"Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight,  CHEKOV: No, sir. ",KIRK
"It'll take time to correct, sir. ",SPOCK
"How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there somewhere, responsibility for four lives here, one of them dying because of me. ",KIRK
You'll enjoy Commodore Travers. He sets a good table. ,KIRK
Wrong. His mind killed him. ,SPOCK
That must be five square kilometres. ,KIRK
Don't you get tired of these games? ,KIRK
I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex. ,SPOCK
Then it isn't Nomad? ,KIRK
You seem to be getting a response. ,KIRK
Right here. You all right? ,KIRK
"No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
We have no time for chess problems. Beam me aboard! ,KIRK
"I'm getting strange readings from the planet surface, Captain. Some sort of power field down there.",SPOCK
"Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding? ",KIRK
Try to contact the ship. ,KIRK
"It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life support systems. ",KIRK
"I cannot obey your order, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second (as another tribble hits him on the head) close that door.",KIRK
Bring them in. ,KIRK
Secure from general quarters. ,KIRK
Coloured gelatin. ,KIRK
I have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there. ,KIRK
Can't we do something? ,KIRK
It's all right. You're on board the Enterprise. ,MCCOY
"Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders? ",KIRK
"Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated expression. ",SPOCK
Or by misleading the innocent. ,MCCOY
I believe that is the correct Earth term. ,SPOCK
Three or four seconds. ,MCCOY
"Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet. ",KIRK
The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite clear on the subject. Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery. ,MCCOY
"What do you make of it, Spock? ",KIRK
"Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here. I think the Enterprise will do quite nicely. I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock. Maintain standard orbit, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long. A few hours at best. ",SPOCK
Will you provide all my nourishment? ,KIRK
Beam down two security men. ,KIRK
"A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser! ",MCCOY
"Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm going to use it. My dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave, but only twelve at a time. And I assure you, for every man you bring down here, I shall have one security guard. There will be no trouble. ",KIRK
"We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is.",SPOCK
But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.,KIRK
No. ,KIRK
"A most difficult decision, Captain. ",SPOCK
Type of vessel. Location. ,KIRK
Zero seven nine. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Yes, certainly. I'll take you. ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do. ",KIRK
"Mister Baris  BARIS: And I'm through being intimidated, Kirk. You have insulted me, you have ignored me, you've walked all over me. You have abused your authority, and you've rejected my requests. And this, this is the result. I'm going to hold you responsible. ",KIRK
Apparently alive. We cannot be sure. ,SPOCK
"Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me. ",SPOCK
"Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into. ",SPOCK
"Jim, I have a new reading. The lights must have triggered some mechanism. ",MCCOY
We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all. ,SPOCK
"Negative, Lieutenant, but keep locked in on us. Kirk out. Let's get him. (phaser fire) ",KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
The other. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, advise the planet's ministry of health that we'll begin decontamination procedures immediately upon locking into orbit. ",KIRK
I don't know how to get inside. ,KIRK
"I'm sorry, Bones._ [Bridge]",KIRK
"Mara. Before you start killing, give me one minute. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
Get this message to all shore parties. Stand by. No one is to leave the ship.,KIRK
His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual. ,SPOCK
Stole a spaceship. ,SPOCK
What happened? ,KIRK
Maybe we can beam him out of there. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. This isn't my communicator. ,KIRK
"No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can teach you. There's nothing you do not know. ",KIRK
Kodos is dead. ,KIRK
Did he not several minutes later repeat that order? ,SPOCK
Captain here. Put McCoy on. ,KIRK
Mister Spock. Wake up. Mister Lesley. ,KIRK
"I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle? ",KIRK
"Captain, I understand your concern. Your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family. ",MCCOY
Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel. ,KIRK
Let me see that. ,KIRK
"I'll be happy to discuss that with you, Mister Spock, next time you drop in to my medical lab. ",MCCOY
What brings you to us? ,KIRK
Under human control. ,KIRK
"Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius. But then he will have lost total resentment toward women. ",MCCOY
I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship. ,KIRK
"It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it. ",SPOCK
Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
She went out to get you. ,KIRK
This isn't a game. It never was a game. ,KIRK
"Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to. But we find something. ",MCCOY
Fantastic architecture. Only an incredibly advanced race could have built it. ,KIRK
Thank you. ,KIRK
"A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble. ",KIRK
"Agmar said something about a weapons deactivator. Mister Sulu, lock ship's phasers on that laboratory building. Use a wide area stun setting. ",KIRK
"Yes. That's correct. One thing at a time. Ah, ah, mmm. (normal voice) That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator. ",SPOCK
"The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her. ",MCCOY
"Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise, with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war. ",KIRK
"Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. ",KIRK
"Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command. ",KIRK
You are a disembodied brain. ,MCCOY
I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician. ,MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Anti-power. ,KIRK
It will take me a moment to prepare. ,SPOCK
How does that Vulcan salute go? ,MCCOY
"Ahead, warp factor two. ",KIRK
"Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do anything that changes history  KIRK: I'm aware of that. But I must know if he's lying, and we can't answer that sitting up here. Have ship's stores prepare the proper costumes. Stand by to beam us down.",SPOCK
"Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain. ",SPOCK
Jim.,SPOCK
"But what about the children, the Onlies? Didn't the awful things affect them? ",KIRK
"Captain, I request permission to be allowed  KIRK: Denied. ",SPOCK
"Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation. ",KIRK
Captain to phaser banks. All components at battle ready. All banks primed.,KIRK
Indeed. ,SPOCK
It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace. ,KIRK
Isn't Governor Cory joining us? ,KIRK
"Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays. ",KIRK
The best I can do is get all the readings I can get and analyse them later. ,MCCOY
"Fire as he passes, Ensign. ",KIRK
"Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser. ",KIRK
"Plead signal for you, sir. Go ahead, Uhura.",KIRK
"Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of. ",SPOCK
"McCoy, Captain. ",MCCOY
"Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy immediately. Oh. Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command. Due to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two. ",KIRK
"Let's go, Bones. ",KIRK
Activate. ,KIRK
Are you sick? ,KIRK
"What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab. Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship. Have them measure it hour by hour. ",KIRK
"They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment. ",KIRK
"Yes, there's no doubt about that. ",MCCOY
"You play chess, Charlie? ",KIRK
"Give it back, then we'll talk. ",KIRK
"Well done, Spock. They've kept what's left of him as a figure head. ",KIRK
"Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are there. (leaves with Spock)",KIRK
"And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful. ",KIRK
Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide? ,KIRK
We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven. ,KIRK
"Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose.",SPOCK
We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation. ,SPOCK
Who are you? Where do you come from? ,KIRK
"I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible. ",SPOCK
"Then try that, Doctor Wallace. Try anything, but do it quickly. ",MCCOY
"Yes, Bones, I remember it. ",KIRK
Me? ,KIRK
You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it could be vanity. ,SPOCK
(nuzzling her neck) Transmuter? ,KIRK
Then we'll beam back up. ,KIRK
"Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie? ",KIRK
Nancy. ,MCCOY
Let's test it. (drinks the contents of a small vial) Nothing's happening. ,KIRK
How long to Starbase Two? ,KIRK
Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed. ,SPOCK
Radiation increasing.,SPOCK
We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production going again. We must have that pergium. ,KIRK
"What do we do now, go up and knock? ",MCCOY
Scotty! ,KIRK
"Take a medical reading, Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura, call Doctor McCoy to the Bridge. ",KIRK
"I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required  KIRK: Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder? ",MCCOY
And whether it wants to or not. ,KIRK
"Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems, barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities. ",SPOCK
You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Mister Spock. Tell it we're trying to help. The mechanism. ,KIRK
"Compute new course, Mister Arex. Let's see what's going on. ",KIRK
Say again. ,KIRK
Mister Advisor! ,KIRK
"Uh, why do you ask? ",KIRK
"We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves. ",KIRK
He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I found him. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Bones, you can't stop now. ",KIRK
Can she talk? ,KIRK
A magnetic probe. ,SPOCK
Rate of compaction seems constant.,SPOCK
"Easy, easy. Nobodies going to  NANCY: But you must help me! ",MCCOY
"Just a moment, Doctor. ",SPOCK
What's happening? ,MCCOY
Only a theory I have. ,SPOCK
"I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't. ",MCCOY
For the moment. ,KIRK
Are any conclusions possible from the information? ,KIRK
Carry on your work? ,KIRK
If we weren't missing two officers and a third one dead I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick or treat on us. ,KIRK
Why did you let him do it? ,KIRK
It would seem logical to do so for the moment. ,SPOCK
I could phaser you out. ,SPOCK
What about the rest of my crew? ,KIRK
"Phasers, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to him except the girl. ,KIRK
"What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect. ",SPOCK
I want you to surrender. ,KIRK
The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can risk a limited exposure. ,SPOCK
"Don't threaten me, Lazarus. ",KIRK
"I won't harm a hair on its head, wherever that is. ",MCCOY
Explain.,KIRK
I'm not. I'm interested in justice. ,KIRK
"You'll have to stand trial. But you did save the Enterprise from the Romulans, and I will recommend that be taken into consideration. ",KIRK
Your word first. ,KIRK
"Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference. ",SPOCK
"Oh, dear. If you'll forgive me, our communications officer  LINCOLN: I would be delighted to have her as guide. ",KIRK
"But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us. ",KIRK
Any type of gaseous cloud? ,KIRK
"Since the days of the first wooden vessels, all shipmasters have had one happy privilege. That of uniting two people in the bonds of matrimony. We are gathered here today with you, Angela Martine, and you, Robert Tomlinson, in the sight of your fellows, in accordance with our laws and our many beliefs so that you may pledge your  SULU [OC]: Alert!

Mister Spock. ,KIRK
"Bridge to Engineering. Scotty, what's happened to the shields? ",KIRK
Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log. ,KIRK
Then you cannot let him die. ,KIRK
Why is this man dying? Hypo.,MCCOY
"No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee.",KIRK
"I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation and weaponry is frozen, and why the Enterprise is locked in orbit. ",KIRK
Completely. ,KIRK
"No. Our methods, our skills are far beyond your abilities. It is time. ",KIRK
"The release of emotions, Mister Spock, is what keeps us healthy.",MCCOY
"Transporter room, emergency beam up now. ",KIRK
Mister Spock.,KIRK
"Spock, you don't know? ",KIRK
Get up here on the double.,KIRK
"Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in the shelter? ",SPOCK
That's useful. ,KIRK
Kukulkan must have visited several ancient peoples on Earth. But each one used only parts of his knowledge to build their cultures. ,KIRK
Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand? ,MCCOY
"With a communicator, we might be able to find out. This fellow is keeping us from our property. ",KIRK
Reduce image. Let me see all of it.,KIRK
"Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by.",SPOCK
Jim. ,MCCOY
"Well, that was close, but you made it. ",MCCOY
My readings keep shifting. It must be the activity of that blasted aurora. ,MCCOY
"Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems, no decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis. In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old, and I can't begin to tell you how old they are, twenty years or twenty thousand years. ",MCCOY
"Mister Scott, will you take the stand? ",KIRK
"I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick.",KIRK
All right. Ahead warp factor two. ,KIRK
"You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them. ",KIRK
I don't blame you. ,KIRK
"I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you. ",KIRK
You know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left. ,KIRK
"If my ancestors were forced out of the cities into the deserts, the hills  SPOCK: Yes. I see, Captain. They would've learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance. ",KIRK
"If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security. ",KIRK
Some more Antarean brandy? (seeing her far-away look) What is it?,KIRK
"Well, I believe it's safe, (cough) safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions. ",SPOCK
"Then what, Mister Boma? ",SPOCK
"Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial, provided the creatures will permit it. ",SPOCK
She will be. I'll stay here with her. The book is in the monolith. ,MCCOY
"What sort of readings, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
Spock? ,KIRK
I don't intend to kill you unless I have to. ,KIRK
"Very kind of you, Spock. ",KIRK
It's probably nothing important. ,MCCOY
"Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and protect the number four shield. ",KIRK
My communications officer generously vacated the rooms hoping you would find it satisfactory. ,KIRK
"Christine, is that you? ",KIRK
Mister Spock. Are you out of your mind? You were told to report to me at once. ,KIRK
"Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no ill effects. ",SPOCK
"Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven,  (The two ships rush towards the star) ",SPOCK
Energise. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future. ",KIRK

"From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent. ",KIRK
You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument? ,KIRK
No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles. ,MCCOY
Re-establish. ,KIRK
Like what? ,KIRK
"There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies, Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman. ",SPOCK
We've got pain-giving devices attached to us. Can you tell us how to get them off. ,KIRK
"Missile spread, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
All I understand is that four thousand people were needlessly butchered. ,KIRK
You fled. Why? Were you afraid? ,KIRK
Care to guess what she is? ,KIRK
Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any objections? ,SPOCK
"Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the data. ",SPOCK
"Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power. ",SPOCK
"True, Bones, but I'm sure there must be something in your little black pouch that can temporarily incapacitate our victim. ",KIRK
"Jim. Agreed you have the authority  KIRK: Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system. ",MCCOY
"Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children. ",SPOCK
"Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear? ",MCCOY
"Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert. ",KIRK

Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception capability. ,SPOCK
"It seems to be of irregular shape, some eight hundred thousand kilometres across and about half that in depth. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Jim. ",MCCOY
You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight? ,KIRK

"McCoy, how do you open this thing? ",KIRK
"Please continue, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on a choice of career. ,KIRK
I've got to find Janice. ,KIRK
"There's no way into that place from up here. Prefect, is there another entrance to that chamber? ",KIRK

"Mister Spock. Come with me, please. ",KIRK
Affirmative. ,KIRK
"I am inclined to agree with the Doctor, Captain. The mass of the planet Alondra has been steadily growing smaller since we've been in here. ",SPOCK
"It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation. ",SPOCK
Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse engines. She's still maneuverable on warp drive. ,SPOCK
"What now, Captain? ",SPOCK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my orders. ",KIRK

I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy. ,MCCOY

Captain Garth  GARTH: Lord Garth! ,SPOCK
Put them on intercom. ,KIRK
Gentlemen! (intervenes as they nearly come to blows.) Spock!,KIRK
"Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him down. Stay in constant touch with us. Give him your phaser. He'll need that, too. ",KIRK
No. Yes. My ship. ,KIRK
Volcanic activity? ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise. ",KIRK
"Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses. ",SPOCK
More power.,KIRK
"He'll live, but I'll have to get him to better facilities than this. ",MCCOY
"Yes. I am undamaged, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, there's always that possibility. I'll go over them again if you like. ",MCCOY
I had hoped I was wrong. ,SPOCK
"Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.",KIRK
"Any new information, Scotty? ",KIRK
Very well. Come with me. ,SPOCK
"None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula. ",SPOCK
He must have attention soon. ,MCCOY
"Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows.",MCCOY
That hurts worse than the uniform. ,MCCOY
Captain. Standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship.,KIRK
"Precisely, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
On my way. ,KIRK
"Audio cut off, Spock. ",KIRK
Flood all decks with neural gas. ,KIRK
You've got to pull him through. ,SPOCK
Then act in a civilised fashion. ,KIRK
"Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay. ",MCCOY
We will go now. ,KIRK
"Sleep well, Miranda. ",KIRK
"Chekov, maintain your post! ",KIRK
"Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you? ",SPOCK
"You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack. ",KIRK
"Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion. ",KIRK
Reverse course. One hundred and eighty degrees about. ,KIRK
"A brother that never existed, a phantom colony, imaginary distress calls, the creation of these weapons. Do you sense a pattern, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Well, at least that gives our landing force a starting point. ",MCCOY
"But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must be a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history. ",KIRK
I've frequently had my doubts.,SPOCK
I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Nevertheless, we must return home and I am open to suggestions. ",KIRK
"Mister Scott, I'm bewildered, that's all. But that's enough. ",KIRK
Energise. Reverse. ,SPOCK
"All right, Bones. Bring him along. ",KIRK
You know us? ,KIRK
The new weapon. Spock? ,KIRK
But in all the confusion I  KIRK: Tell me. ,MCCOY
"No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is an access point. It would also seem to be a  (He steps forward and is flung back.) ",SPOCK
"Well, I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere who'll stop that war.  ",KIRK
What was there to do? ,SPOCK
One of us must get him. ,KIRK
Your new approach? ,KIRK
"It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
McCoy could verify all that. ,KIRK
We came in peace. ,KIRK
Not good. If I could only operate. ,MCCOY
"No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it.",KIRK
"Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect. ",SPOCK
No! ,KIRK
"Captain, I have assumed command. ",SPOCK
"This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones. We seem to be in the middle of a creeping paralysis. Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise before we started losing power. ",KIRK
"Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it. ",KIRK
That fact isn't in the history texts. ,KIRK
"May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we started from. ",SPOCK
And the tribbles had nothing to do with it? ,KIRK
"Whenever you're ready, Mister Leslie.",KIRK
"Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity, though of a unique technology. ",SPOCK
It's certainly worth a try. ,MCCOY
Then you can tell us. Do you remember? ,KIRK
I am aware of that. ,SPOCK
Don't say any more. ,KIRK
It's gone. I could have been wrong. The last time I caught an odour like that was eleven years ago. ,KIRK
Who controls this complex? ,KIRK
"We don't have any other facts, any information. ",KIRK
I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.,SPOCK
"An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class. ",KIRK
"Oh now, let me guess. It's you and Carter Winston. He told me a little about it when I examined him. ",MCCOY
"You say it, Demos, but that doesn't  (Then he is pounced upon by the Dramian they have been chasing. Spock and Demos pull him off) ",KIRK
"Very good, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Anything? ,KIRK
(close to tears) I'm in control of my emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty.,SPOCK
"No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order. ",KIRK
"Hmm. Or it could be the sender. Lieutenant Uhura, all stations to Yellow Alert. Standard hailing on all frequencies. Identification, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here. ",SPOCK
Can you get to the library? ,KIRK
It's got to work. ,KIRK
Then I'd better handle it. (goes over to a very satisfied looking woman) You all right? ,KIRK
Lieutenant. ,KIRK
"You mean, all the people are dead? ",KIRK
The stars. ,KIRK
It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible. ,SPOCK
Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull. Put a team on that warp drive. Get it working. ,KIRK
And transport him to these co-ordinates.,KIRK
"I doubt we'll be able to do so without being seen, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Evaluation, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Within you. ,SPOCK
"Just stay where you are, Commander. ",KIRK
"What's that supposed to mean? If that was supposed to be a joke, Spock, I have to remind you Vulcans don't tell jokes. ",MCCOY
I prefer to call it inspired. ,KIRK
Time factor? ,KIRK
"Another technical journal, Scotty? ",KIRK
You only heard part of it. I just started. ,KIRK
Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first planet survey. ,KIRK
I order you to report to the Sickbay. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant Uhura, inform Command base, In my opinion, no option.",KIRK
How come we always end up like this? ,KIRK
"Living like the Indians, and finally even looking like the American Indian. American. Yangs? Yanks? Spock, Yankees!_ SPOCK: Kohms? Communists? The parallel is almost too close, Captain. It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet. ",KIRK
What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready. ,KIRK
We don't have much time. ,MCCOY
I can't for the life of me imagine which one. ,KIRK
Who? ,KIRK
I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down. ,SPOCK
"We have been encased in a globular force field, Captain. The source is the approaching vessel. ",SPOCK
"And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there. ",SPOCK
"You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong. ",KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately. ,KIRK
I sensed it die. ,SPOCK
I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there. ,KIRK
"Enterprise. Enterprise, can you hear me? ",KIRK
You offered me the lives of my crew. ,KIRK
Then I would say proceed. ,KIRK
Can you pinpoint the source? ,KIRK
"Doc isn't sure it was a murder attempt. Besides, I have an idea may prove  SPOCK: Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum. ",KIRK
"Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full power deflector screens. ",KIRK
And his tough Vulcan hide for another. ,MCCOY
"What do you mean, survival? ",KIRK
Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm. ,KIRK
"No, I don't think I've for  SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?",KIRK
Bob Wesley. He left Starfleet for the governorship. He's no hysteric. ,KIRK
Bones! Spock! ,KIRK
Scan all other banks. ,SPOCK
Spock to Enterprise. ,SPOCK
What is your destination? ,SPOCK
"Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. You must rely on your human intuition. ",SPOCK
That's assuming they got here three days ago. ,KIRK
"Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship.",KIRK
"Well, followers can be led. Let's hope we can be as persuasive as Keniclius. ",KIRK
Good.,KIRK
"Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms. ",SPOCK
"You have an intruder aboard. Could be masquerading as Crewman Green. General quarters, security condition three. ",KIRK
The need was apparently desperate. ,MCCOY
"Nurse Chapel, what in the devil? ",MCCOY
Put Security on it.,KIRK
Turn the ship around. We're going home.  ,KIRK
What of Lazarus? ,SPOCK
I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov. ,SPOCK
They want us to lose our heads.,KIRK
"Detail, fan out. What is this thing, Mister Spock? It seems to be pulsating with power of some kind. Analysis, please. ",KIRK
What was it? ,KIRK
Doctor? ,SPOCK
You are being used by him. ,KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. (a third bolt approaching) Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres. ",SPOCK
"Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order! ",KIRK
No response. ,SPOCK
Commander Balok.,KIRK
It has directional equipment that keys on indurite. ,KIRK
"Standard phasers. Good. They may have more speed, but they're not giants. ",KIRK
Captain. (gives him a phaser) ,SPOCK
Spock to Bridge. ,SPOCK
Explain. ,SPOCK
"Captain Kor and I were preparing to attempt an escape from here tomorrow. If you hibernate the Klothos, you will not only be punishing them but us. We cannot leave as a single ship. I urge you to permit our dual ship to depart tomorrow as scheduled. ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this planet?,KIRK
"Backward child, but growing. ",KIRK
"Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on her when it became serious. ",KIRK
Activate port impulse engines. One third power. ,SPOCK
"And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons. ",SPOCK
Let's look a little further. ,KIRK
"Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded? ",SPOCK
"Captain, I have managed to loosen this grill somewhat. If the mortar on yours is as old. ",SPOCK
Subject's present physical condition. ,KIRK
"Right, Captain. ",SPOCK
"No, Captain. No. ",KIRK
That would account for the tunnels. ,KIRK
"That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too. ",MCCOY
"Mister Spock, would you care to take on that duty? ",KIRK
You want to bet? ,MCCOY
What about it? ,KIRK
I was just expressing my curiosity at our ability to get into these kind of situations. ,KIRK
"At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost, but I've run checks on all the instrumentation. All the equipment is functioning perfectly. ",SPOCK
"We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here.",SPOCK
Impact in ninety three seconds. Ninety two. Ninety one. ,SPOCK
Then what am l? ,SPOCK
I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder. ,MCCOY
Incredible. ,MCCOY
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
Concentrate on the underside of the neck. ,KIRK
"We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background radiation. ",SPOCK
"Come on. You want this, Nancy? Come on Nancy. Come and get it.",KIRK
"I don't think so, sir. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I see. ",SPOCK
You mean you're going to trust him? ,MCCOY
You caught him. ,MCCOY
"But it has happened, Doctor.",SPOCK
"How's O'Shea, Bones? ",KIRK
"Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship.",KIRK
We've got to communicate with them. ,KIRK
He's his smiling self again. I've discharged him from Sickbay. ,MCCOY
"Very good, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. ,SPOCK
The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training. They're about due for a small return. We have two hours with which to do it in. ,KIRK
"Yeah, we can handle it, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Sulu, are we still on the same co-ordinates? ",KIRK
"Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down. ",KIRK
"The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic emotional structure. You had one once before. Now I need another one to compare with that previous test. There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths. Over here, Captain.",MCCOY
It must be a transporter malfunction. ,KIRK
Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream. ,KIRK
No. ,KIRK
What was that? ,KIRK
"Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids? ",KIRK
Good. (puts it into a decoder) We both guessed right.,KIRK
Tribbles don't like Klingons. That should have given you some clue. ,KIRK
"Yes, sir. Quite understandable. ",SPOCK
"High rank probabilities, Captain. It is a magnetic organism without mass, but capable of symbiotic relationship with a host body, a starship for instance. It is a form of primal energy, and it can utilise the electronic control systems of a starship like the mind of a man uses the neural control systems of the human body. It has become the Enterprise, and we are only life-support organisms in its body like the white corpuscles in human blood. And Captain, the magnetic flux readings are higher. It is growing stronger, building itself. ",SPOCK
"Status of mission, Captain? ",SPOCK
"That's my decision, Doctor.",KIRK
(twitching) Correct. ,SPOCK
"An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones. ",SPOCK
We'd have killed each other. ,KIRK
"Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a biological unit, and I created you. ",KIRK
"Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Needed on the bridge, Captain.",SPOCK
"Captain, I'm getting no life form register. ",MCCOY
"Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human. ",SPOCK
"Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem. ",KIRK
"First Officer out. Doctor, as senior officer present, I present myself to you for arrest.",SPOCK
"This is not a laboratory, Commander Bem. This is a hostile planet, and representatives of Starfleet are not experimental animals for you to test! Consider yourself under arrest. Protective custody, to keep you from any more escapades. Mister Spock, keep watch. ",KIRK
You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to Sickbay? ,MCCOY
I'm glad you're alive. ,KIRK
"Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available? ",KIRK
"Yes, Mister Spock, it would indeed.  ",KIRK
Indeed. ,SPOCK
Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. ,KIRK
"Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. USS Enterprise to signaler on planet surface. Identify self. ",SPOCK
Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off. ,SPOCK
How bad? ,KIRK
It's all right. Let him go. ,KIRK
It has to do with biology. ,SPOCK
"Officer posted, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command. ",SPOCK
Are these attacks frequent? ,SPOCK
"Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that? ",KIRK
"Doctor, how's the girl? ",KIRK
"You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott. ",KIRK
But why would Kukulkan want to destroy us? ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch. ",SPOCK
It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is increasingly serious. Continue present course. ,KIRK
I wouldn't lie to you. ,KIRK
This is where the Captain said to rendezvous. (makes Tonia stand with her back to a tree) I swear I heard someone moving around.,MCCOY
But how did he survive the plague? ,KIRK
"Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements. ",SPOCK
"That is very kind of you, Captain. ",SPOCK
Like a spider spins his web. ,KIRK
You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. ,KIRK
"If it were around right now, it would correct  (M4 enters) ",KIRK
"I think we've been trying to, Spock. Humans have their faults, greed, envy, panicky fear. But in the centuries since the Salem witch trials we have learned. We try to understand and respect all life forms. ",KIRK
Like a hawk. ,MCCOY
"As soon as our course stabilizes, give me a reading. ",KIRK
"I am unconscious, or demented. ",MCCOY
It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.,SPOCK
"Mister Sulu, I would like  UHURA: Captain. It corrected itself. ",KIRK
A place to sleep. ,KIRK
"What's going on, Bones? ",KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle. ",SPOCK
We come from another province. ,KIRK
"Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history.",SPOCK
I'm telling you now. ,KIRK
Mister Sulu. ,KIRK
"Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form? ",KIRK
"Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Bones, let them help. ",KIRK
"Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom? ",SPOCK
Always in the past tense.,SPOCK
The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us.,SPOCK
Without the other. ,SPOCK
You were on the bridge when we were attacked. ,KIRK
"I know, Scotty. ",KIRK
I think I've found it. ,MCCOY
"Leave me here, Spock. ",MCCOY
They appear to be as advanced beyond Earth civilisation as you are from a colony of ants. ,SPOCK
The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed. ,MCCOY
Your statement is illogical. ,KIRK
Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in.,KIRK
"No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature, Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched.",SPOCK
I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be.,MCCOY
What? ,MCCOY
Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.,SPOCK
"Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you.",KIRK
"You noticed that, huh? Here. This ought to take care of it. ",MCCOY
"There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations. ",SPOCK
"Scotty, lie to me. How old are you? ",KIRK
"The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that. ",SPOCK
With us as the mouse. ,KIRK
You are the evil. The evil must be destroyed. Fulfill the Prime Directive. ,KIRK
"Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's wife, she said there was something in that root. She said now you can refuse her nothing. ",MCCOY
"Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties. ",KIRK
"I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind. ",SPOCK
"We're worried about her safety. Aren't you? Professor, you're a reasonable man, let me (comm. beep) Kirk here. ",KIRK
Put it on visual. ,KIRK
"For the record, how do we describe him? Pure mentality? Force of intellect? Embodied energy? Superbeing? He must be classified, sir. ",SPOCK
"Spock, we'll have you out in a minute. ",KIRK
"Commander Bem, Mister Spock and I are here because we thought that you were worth rescuing. It was more to preserve the diplomatic relations between the Federation and planet Pandro than from any great affection for yourself. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Where's Kryton? ,KIRK
"I hadn't planned to, Bones. Why? ",KIRK
"Jim, it worked for her. It might work for me. ",MCCOY
Quickly. Quickly. ,KIRK
"It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead. ",SPOCK
There is a certain scientific logic about it. ,SPOCK
Captain's quarters. Aren't you the one who always says a little suffering is good for the soul?,KIRK
"Logical, Captain. ",SPOCK
Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators? ,KIRK
"What would you have me do, turn around and leave them there? ",KIRK
Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti? ,SPOCK
Phaser banks. Report.,KIRK
"A ship. Yes, a ship for Triacus. But why? By whom? (into comm.)",KIRK
Enterprise. Spock here. ,SPOCK
What?,KIRK
"Spock, do you honestly believe that as long as we're in this universe we can work magic too? ",KIRK
Where's Apollo? ,KIRK
Prepare for interphase in  [Bridge],SPOCK
"Well, we have a shadow. Faster, more manoeuvrable and unidentified. Mister Spock, full analysis of sensor readings. I want to know who that intruder is.",KIRK
"At norm, Mister Kyle. Controls at neutral. ",SPOCK
"Jim! Jim, it's Sturgeon. He's dead. ",MCCOY
I said I hoped I behaved correctly. ,KIRK
"I wasn't sure. Any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley. ",KIRK
"Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years after that. ",KIRK
"How about it, Spock? ",KIRK
"Captain, there is a chance  KIRK: I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back with the information. I'll be right there. Scotty, energise transporter.",SPOCK
Against the wall! ,KIRK
Someone strangled this woman.,SPOCK
"(with a grin and echoy voice) Hello. Oh, you are a lovely female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years. ",SPOCK
"Mister Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the glade. I'd like some answers to all this.",KIRK
"I believe they were never actually present, Doctor. It was a mirage. ",SPOCK
"Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to your left. ",SPOCK
"Norman, who created you? ",KIRK
"Did she cry, Jim? ",MCCOY
"Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on. Mrs. Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret? ",MCCOY
Mister Spock. ,KIRK
He's dead.,MCCOY
I can't. Power level's dropping too fast.,KIRK
"On pure speculation, just an educated guess, I'd say that man is alive. ",MCCOY
"Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark seven. ",SPOCK
"There's nothing disgusting about it. It's just another life form, that's all. You get used to those things. ",MCCOY
What is it? ,MCCOY
In this room? ,KIRK
"Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled. ",SPOCK
Why? ,KIRK
At gunpoint?,KIRK
"Well, the field's down, people are going in. Let's see what kind of luck we have. ",KIRK
Where is she? Has something happened to her? ,KIRK

"Jim, what are you doing here? ",MCCOY
"And, of course, your people found an answer.",MCCOY

Scotty. ,KIRK
"This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please, do not come any closer to our ship. ",KIRK
We have tried. ,SPOCK
Thank you. ,SPOCK
"Report._ SPOCK: The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out. ",KIRK
Forever beloved. Forever. ,KIRK

"Mister Spock, ETA the Benecia Colony. ",KIRK
Watch out! ,MCCOY
"If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in  KIRK: That's no miscalculation. ",MCCOY
Looks like they're getting ready to go on a trip. ,MCCOY
"Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight bruise or two, our Captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse. He'll be coming out of it in a minute or two. ",MCCOY
Spock. You can see. ,KIRK
I'm doing what I can. (to Spock) You're perfectly healthy. ,MCCOY
Of course. Come with me. ,MCCOY
Ship to ship.,KIRK
They fired at him. ,KIRK
"They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more. ",SPOCK
"Yes, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three, report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet. Ordinance condition One A. ",KIRK
Patient? Our friend is dying. ,KIRK
"That is an order, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
"Captain, if you'll excuse me. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Mister Arex. Kirk out. ",KIRK
Guidance control's taking over. I believe we can allow this ship to go back to its automatic control. ,SPOCK
We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.,KIRK
But there is. ,MCCOY
This is Spock. ,SPOCK
"At the moment, I seem to have no choice. ",KIRK
"But you've got, er, eleven. ",KIRK
I dare say you will. Come now. ,SPOCK
"Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin. ",SPOCK
"Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately. ",KIRK
Lieutenant O'Neil. Where is he? ,KIRK
I'm on my way. ,KIRK
On my way.,KIRK
"Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said. ",KIRK
I was talking about both. ,KIRK
"Approximately 1691, Captain. Salem Massachusetts, if I recall your historical records correctly. ",SPOCK
Their attempt has given me an idea as to how we may be able to break through the time barrier. ,SPOCK
"Computer, could the described entity assume physical form? ",KIRK
"Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators. Without them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't have a chance.",MCCOY
"Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out. ",KIRK
Let's get out of here. ,KIRK
All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought.,KIRK
We want the Enterprise. ,KIRK
I'll drink to that. What emotion? ,MCCOY
"Captain, I  KIRK: No, I don't really expect an answer. ",MCCOY
"Nancy, er  NANCY: My husband? I like your feelings better. Much stronger. But you're tired, You need to rest. ",MCCOY
Because we don't like you. Now. (shooing away gesture) ,KIRK
But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact.,KIRK
What are we waiting for? ,KIRK
"And my responsibility is the health of this crew. You've been driving yourself too hard, and I want you to get some rest. ",MCCOY
I'm plotting an intercept course. Will rendezvous with you at fourteen thirteen point seven hours. ,KIRK
"You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals? ",KIRK
Let me guess. Klingons? Baris? ,MCCOY
Then get me that old portable cardio-stimulator. ,MCCOY
I can answer none of your questions at this time. ,SPOCK
"Launch probe at zero acceleration. Forward thrust off, one tenth of a second. ",KIRK
Lead projectile. Primitive firearm. ,KIRK
I'm responsible. Let them go. ,KIRK
"You intend to stay here, on Yonada? ",MCCOY
"Mister Sandoval, within the hour I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony. Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise. ",KIRK
Joy to you. ,KIRK
"Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief  MUDD: Come now. ",KIRK
It is possible that this much of their technology survived.,SPOCK
"Tchar, be careful. We need you, too. ",KIRK
Wait a moment. ,KIRK
You were saying something about trick or treat.,MCCOY
"James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet.",SPOCK
"Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain.",KIRK
Transported without incident. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council. ",KIRK
"Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary? ",KIRK
He's not dying? ,KIRK
"You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural condition of this individual? ",SPOCK
"That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will find it. ",SPOCK
And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans. ,KIRK
Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive. ,SPOCK
What's its course? ,KIRK
"Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago. They wore clothing similar to ours. Have you heard of such men? ",SPOCK
Right. Just like the captain. ,MCCOY
"That's impossible, Spock. Carter Winston's been missing over five years. ",MCCOY
"Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three five. ",SPOCK
That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself. ,KIRK
"Take it easy. Lie down, Scotty. We just want to check you out. ",MCCOY
"Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown. ",MCCOY
The same as our Ensign. ,MCCOY
"Jim, why no briefing on this? I'd at least like to know what we're getting into. ",MCCOY
Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.,KIRK
"Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal. ",SPOCK
"Because, if he killed us outright in front of you, you'd retaliate. You're a doctor. You have the means. Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished. Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant. ",KIRK
"Mister Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation. ",KIRK
"It's what the doctor ordered, Jim.",MCCOY
And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way? ,KIRK
"Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain. ",SPOCK
"It's a beautiful place. A little strange, I'll admit.",MCCOY
"Yes, Mister Spock. You'd be a natural. I'll explain it to you one day. Shall we have a look around? ",KIRK
"Hey, Jim, look. Scotty and a search party. ",MCCOY
That building in the centre. It seems to be important. ,KIRK
I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid. ,SPOCK
"Jim, did you see what I saw? ",MCCOY
We're getting something. ,KIRK
Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk. ,KIRK
"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius.",KIRK
"Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon. ",SPOCK
Why is it forbidden? ,KIRK
"I've come to the conclusion they are, Captain. But the speed at which the thoughts flow is too great for me to comprehend except for the most fleeting image. ",SPOCK
Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard radiation. ,SPOCK
"You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you did. I got the same information. ",SPOCK
Jim. You lie still. I'll check her out right away. ,MCCOY
"As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms. ",MCCOY
"Which humans, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions. No answers.",KIRK
"Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim? ",MCCOY
What happened? ,KIRK
"Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back. You better find out how that thing works and soon. ",MCCOY
What the devil was that thing? ,MCCOY
"Coming within visual range now, Captain. ",SPOCK
"And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim. ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
"Keep trying, Lieutenant. ",KIRK
He's probably beaming down with the crystals right now. I'm going after him. You organise a security detail. Follow me as soon as you can. ,KIRK
"But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're  SPOCK: No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife. Or die. ",KIRK
"Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines. We're going to put a hundred million miles between us and that madman. ",KIRK
"It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system. ",MCCOY
"Enterprise, Spock here. ",SPOCK
Will she live? ,KIRK
Can half a man live? ,KIRK
"Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding. ",MCCOY
Yes? ,MCCOY
My brother's son? ,KIRK
"Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first. ",SPOCK
The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her. ,KIRK
And that became Lincoln? ,MCCOY
You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now? ,KIRK
"(to nurse) If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room. ",KIRK
"Security, cancel that order. Implement a full search for the mechanism. All decks report to me here. ",KIRK
What do you mean? ,KIRK
"Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing away.",KIRK
"Captain, I believe you'll find the alien  KIRK: We damaged their ship. They destroyed themselves to avoid capture. Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab.",SPOCK
No identification of self or mission. No interference with the social development of said planet. ,KIRK
"What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal?",KIRK
"Bones, that's it. Stay with Chekov. Keep those people from feeding Vaal. Don't let them feed Vaal. Keep them in the hut. Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once. ",SPOCK
I shall attempt it. ,SPOCK
(another chip) Mister Spock is with me here. He'll answer all questions. Kirk out.,KIRK
"The creature leading you a merry chase, Mister Sulu? ",MCCOY
"Well, Doctor? ",KIRK
That's true. ,KIRK
"Jim! You touch it, her nearest male relative will have to try to kill you. They're offering you a chance for combat. They consider it more pleasurable than love. ",MCCOY
"Yes, he is. ",KIRK
Keep trying.,SPOCK
Scotty? ,KIRK
It would be worse if he had company. ,MCCOY
"Thank you, sir. I have considered all the alternatives. My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion. ",KIRK
"We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. ",SPOCK
He was aware of what might happen when he went. ,SPOCK
Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape  KIRK: Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected. ,SPOCK
We're in the hands of an adolescent.,SPOCK
And we'll forget about a certain stowaway. ,KIRK
"This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy. ",KIRK
"And you, Doctor? ",SPOCK
"Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay. ",MCCOY
"Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation. ",KIRK
That's correct. ,KIRK
"Yes, not happy at all. ",KIRK
Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference. ,SPOCK
"Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock. ",KIRK
Thirty seconds is very slim timing. ,SPOCK
Is there a replacement for that? ,KIRK
"I'm sorry, Spock, it's your   As these little surprises have grown more and more frequent, our crew members have found them less and less amusing. ",KIRK
I already have a lot of green memories. ,KIRK
"Commander Bem, you are responsible for the situation we are in.",KIRK
What's that? ,MCCOY
"Not likely, Captain. ",SPOCK
"This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial. We have used these filter masks frequently on  PLASUS [on monitor]: Do you really expect me to believe that that mask can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes? ",KIRK
It would have a very small field. ,SPOCK
"Spock, I  SPOCK: So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements. ",MCCOY
"You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of that. ",MCCOY
"Ahead warp factor eight. Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. ",KIRK
"Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up. ",KIRK
Do you want me to beam up a party? ,SPOCK
"You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
"Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain. ",SPOCK
Just have those crystals here when I get back.,KIRK
McCoy to Enterprise. ,MCCOY
"Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing audio-visual suggestion, Captain. ",SPOCK
He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't  COLEMAN: You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his murderer. ,KIRK
I'd like a few minutes to inform my crew. ,KIRK
I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I should have realised. ",KIRK
Bring us about. We'll investigate the Beta Lyrae system. ,SPOCK
"Mister Spock. Full sensor scan of the region, please. ",KIRK
Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed. ,KIRK
"Firing, Captain. ",SPOCK
"But what, Scotty? ",KIRK
Where did they go? ,KIRK
Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive. ,SPOCK
Ready photon torpedoes. Fire one. ,KIRK
"Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment. ",SPOCK
"Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will do even better. Would it not, Commander? ",SPOCK
Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet? ,KIRK
The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness._ Y SPOCK: Do you think I'll ever be able to do that neck pinch as well as you? ,SPOCK
So you tested the programme bank. ,MCCOY
"Yes, sir. I can't seem to get through, Captain. They appear too involved with each other. ",SPOCK
What's the matter? ,KIRK
"Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated. ",SPOCK

There are other Vulcans aboard. ,KIRK
"Captain, you're becoming emotional. ",SPOCK

"If we assume the cloud is a living being, we must also assume it needs some kind of food to sustain itself. ",SPOCK

Why not? ,KIRK
That's impossible. What could have happened? ,KIRK
What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean them no harm. ,KIRK
"The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put the questions. ",SPOCK
"Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan. ",KIRK
What can we do to stop it? ,KIRK
"What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881. ",MCCOY

Mister Spock? ,KIRK
"Come on, Spock, the passageway was there before. It's got to be there. ",MCCOY
Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities. (the sound of a transporter off screen) T'Pring. Explain. ,SPOCK
"This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course correction. Helmsman, steady as she goes.  ",KIRK

"I know. I'm worried about Jim, too.",MCCOY
They're experts at gunfighting. We don't have a chance. ,KIRK
"Situation, Mister Scott? ",KIRK
"Just a minute. You'd better make me a mechanic. Then I can treat little tin gods like you. (He punches Elias) Sorry, Sandoval. I don't know what made me do that. ",MCCOY
"Excuse us, miss. We didn't mean to trespass. It's cold outside. ",KIRK

Jeopardising his crew and his ship unnecessarily? ,KIRK

You don't think by any chance that Scotty  KIRK: It doesn't make any difference what I think. ,MCCOY

Most remarkable. ,SPOCK
"A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott. ",SPOCK
Any indication of Keniclius or Spock? ,KIRK
"There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down a large contingent. ",SPOCK
You recall that energy field we passed through? ,SPOCK
There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three. ,SPOCK
"Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable. ",SPOCK

(examining a roll of film) Poor photography. ,SPOCK
"What do you mean, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK
The Romulan ships have halted their attack. Apparently the sight of a spacecraft twenty times their size has given them second thoughts.,SPOCK
"Security. I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad. Pick it up in Sickbay. ",KIRK
"Captain, receiving a transporter signal. ",MCCOY
"More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up first pass over their camp. ",KIRK
Check circuits for malfunctions. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"Damage reports, Mister Stiles? ",SPOCK

"She had bad internal injuries, Jim. ",MCCOY
"You underestimate yourself, Commander. ",SPOCK
Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance? ,MCCOY
"Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder. ",SPOCK
Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake. ,KIRK
His pulse is fading. (turns pink again) Pulse and heart normal.,MCCOY
"Oh, you don't have to worry. I know how to handle this. I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too. ",MCCOY
What changed your mind about the Romulans? ,KIRK
The situation is not immediately dangerous. Have the volunteers stand by. Kirk out. ,KIRK
"But there are other bosses, other territories? ",KIRK
Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you? ,SPOCK
Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the logic of history. ,SPOCK
You have a thick skin. ,KIRK
He stole a spaceship. ,KIRK
"Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres. ",KIRK
The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then. ,SPOCK
Why? ,KIRK
"Transporter Room, stand by to beam landing party aboard. ",SPOCK
"What about it, Spock? ",KIRK
"Any contact, Lieutenant Uhura? ",KIRK
"Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes. ",KIRK
"If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our  KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. What's happening up there? ",SPOCK
"I can't move, Jim. They're going to keep me here no matter what.",MCCOY
"Obscure, meaningless words. ",KIRK
"Lock on, Mister Sulu. Maximum speed. ",KIRK
"Why not?_ COGLEY: I've got my own system. Books, young man, books. Thousands of them. If time wasn't so important, I'd show you something. My library.",KIRK
"Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam from it.",SPOCK
Uh oh. ,KIRK
There's nothing else to be done. ,MCCOY
"Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. ",KIRK
"Yes, I know. We saw it. ",KIRK
Try again. ,KIRK
"Go. Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation. ",KIRK
Can we track it? ,KIRK
We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled.,KIRK
"No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked. ",MCCOY
I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting for? ,MCCOY
"What is it, Ensign? ",KIRK
Give it to me! ,KIRK
Then show yourselves. ,KIRK
"Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time. ",KIRK
So it would seem. ,SPOCK
"But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim.",MCCOY
"He may think we're destroyed, Captain. ",SPOCK
Report on technology. ,KIRK
"Add to that a simple diet, a perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed. Maybe it is paradise after all. ",KIRK
I tried. ,KIRK
"The trail is becoming fainter, Captain. I recommend we reduce speed to accommodate our sensors. ",SPOCK
It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit. ,SPOCK
Yes. ,SPOCK
"I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but. Yeoman Barrows, you accompany Mister Sulu. Find out where those tracks came from. Doctor, you come with me back to the glade. I'd like another look at that area. ",KIRK
"A canal. And with it we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge. And we can expand the system, and irrigate the fields and double the food supply. ",KIRK
"He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even him. ",KIRK
This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will code mark for me. ,SPOCK
We've got to try. We're helpless. See if it can do something. ,KIRK
"That's right. You can step off the transporter  CHRISTOPHER: Captain John Christopher, United States Air Force. Serial number 4857932. ",KIRK
I'm worried about the Enterprise. ,KIRK
"A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget. ",KIRK
A Vulcan would not cry out so. ,SPOCK
"Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down.",SPOCK
"Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey.",KIRK
Of course. ,SPOCK
What is it? ,MCCOY
"Two tunnels, two of us. We separate. ",KIRK
Well? ,KIRK
What happened to my men? ,KIRK
Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail. ,SPOCK
Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio. Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy. They didn't have subspace communication in those days. ,KIRK
"Yes, what is it? ",KIRK
Break contact! ,KIRK
Could mental disease have infected all of the crew? ,KIRK
"You must know that's impossible. Starfleet regulations  CLAUDIUS: Are designed to circumvent any such order. There may be over four hundred men on your ship, Captain, but they can be brought down if it's handled properly. Say, a few at a time. You see, I have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible. Your communicator, Captain Kirk. Now do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders. ",MCCOY
"What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it  DECKER: Both or neither. I don't know. ",KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
"Go ahead, Scotty. ",MCCOY
Whatever gave you that idea? ,MCCOY
"Commander Bem, if you had those two phasers and those communicators all this time, why didn't you use them to escape? ",KIRK
"I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you. ",SPOCK
Would you like to take a crack at it? ,MCCOY
"Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.",SPOCK
"Yes, everything will be taken care of. This is Mister Spock, my First Officer. ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",SPOCK
"From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain. ",SPOCK
"It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, Captain, but far more complicated. ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience. ",SPOCK
Spock  (They all fall over) ,KIRK
"Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock.",SPOCK
"Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some natural phenomena. ",SPOCK
Kirk out. ,KIRK
You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all. ,KIRK
"Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five. ",MCCOY
"And I would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns and we can't risk both of us being off the ship. ",KIRK
You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth. ,KIRK
"I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals. ",SPOCK
"And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon. ",KIRK
Request denied. ,KIRK
Have your readings been fed into the computer? ,KIRK
"Captain, I insist upon going. Christine. I can't stand the thought of any danger to her, to the woman I love. ",SPOCK
"Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet. ",SPOCK
"Seventeen point nine, to be exact. ",SPOCK
"Engineering, report. ",KIRK

"Any contact, Lieutenant? ",KIRK
It must've wiped out everything. ,MCCOY
Bridge to Dispensary. ,SPOCK
What? ,KIRK
The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on. ,KIRK
My phaser didn't cut through it. ,KIRK
The Captain and all of the crew members are incapacitated. The plague is aboard the Enterprise. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Then you're with Doctor Adams now.,SPOCK
She's a good ship. (takes a glass from a passing tray) Thank you.,KIRK
"This is Captain Kirk. You have confirmation, Miss Uhura.",KIRK
"I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets. ",SPOCK
"Have no fear. Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do. ",KIRK
"Trying to. Something's obstructing it. (finally the familiar shape fully materialises) Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to leave the ship. ",KIRK
Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song? ,MCCOY
Yes. Why didn't she kill you? ,MCCOY
"Pain, Captain. And you, my dear? ",SPOCK
Why? ,KIRK
What co-ordinates? ,KIRK
"He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain. ",SPOCK
The confidence of an innocent man. ,KIRK
I am sorry.,SPOCK
Make it less. ,KIRK
What is it? ,KIRK
"Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? ",KIRK
But that's not the way it happened.,KIRK
"Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please, come in.",KIRK
"Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that. ",MCCOY
"Power out on all but key levels, Captain. High magnetic flux reading. ",SPOCK
"Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps.",KIRK
"Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors. ",SPOCK
Yes?,MCCOY
Pick it up.,KIRK
"You have a point, Spock? ",MCCOY
"And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him  MCCOY: In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will.",KIRK
What happened? ,KIRK
Yes. ,MCCOY
Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour.,MCCOY
"Negative, Captain. It doesn't register. ",SPOCK
"No survivors, no bodies either. ",KIRK
Ready phasers. ,KIRK
Phaser banks? ,KIRK
"The crew is fit. I found nothing unusual, with one exception. ",MCCOY
"That's a very good idea, Bones. ",KIRK
I recognise what you appear to be. ,KIRK
"It's getting critical. There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks. Even Scotty's being affected. If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise out of here. ",MCCOY
Help Chekov. ,KIRK
Where is everyone? ,KIRK
Contact them directly. ,SPOCK
Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty? ,KIRK
This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating personnel. You can't  TRELANE: I can do anything I want. I should think you would have realised that by now. ,KIRK
"Quite clear, Captain. ",SPOCK
Well let's get there. ,MCCOY
"His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid. ",KIRK
Then she'll die. ,KIRK
"Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla. ",MCCOY
"Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it work. And he did. But according to Spock, it works illogically. ",MCCOY
No one is to move. Spock? Are you all right? ,KIRK
Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you? ,KIRK
This is the Enterprise. I must speak with the Supreme Prefect. ,SPOCK
"Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim. ",MCCOY
"This is Kirk. Matt, you'll be killed. ",KIRK

"For sale by  TRACEY: (to Wu) Out. (Wu leaves) By those who own the serum. McCoy will eventually isolate it. Meanwhile, you inform your ship your situation's impossible. Order them away. When we're ready, we'll bargain for a whole fleet of ships to pick us up. And they'll do it. ",KIRK
Good. Let's get to work. ,KIRK
"What is this, Mister Sulu? ",KIRK

What exactly were you doing? ,KIRK
"If we don't try, Spock doesn't have a chance. ",KIRK
Did you find anything? ,KIRK
And what would be the point? ,KIRK
"Cartographic Detail, stand by. ",KIRK
Either one could solve our problems right now. ,KIRK
"Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated. ",SPOCK
Professor and Nancy Crater. ,KIRK
It is. We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer the ways of peaceful contact. I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing. We have sought you out to join us. Our mission is still one of peace. ,KIRK

"A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable, occasionally brilliant. ",SPOCK
Not guilty. ,KIRK
"No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed. ",MCCOY
"Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce. ",SPOCK
"Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three. ",KIRK
"Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him. ",MCCOY
Spock. ,KIRK
"If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin immediately. Correction,  [Bridge]",KIRK
We've seen the results of your touch. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. ",MCCOY

"Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger? ",KIRK
How's it going? ,KIRK
Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design. ,KIRK
"Now, Mister Sulu. (the ship lurches sideways) More power, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
How long will the power hold out? ,KIRK
"Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition. In spite of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a few variations. However, there's an extra organ in his chest that I can't even make a guess about. ",MCCOY
Ah. ,KIRK
"Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him. ",SPOCK
Can you estimate minimum time required for repair? ,SPOCK
"I don't know who or what you are, but I must warn you we have the power to defend ourselves. If you value your safety, release this ship.",KIRK
"Good. That should be sufficient. Beam it up to Mister Spock when you're ready, and start enjoying yourselves.",KIRK
"Yes, we have to control our emotional reactions. ",KIRK
It would seem so. ,SPOCK
"Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status, Captain. ",SPOCK
"The Neutral Zone? We have no authorisation to enter it. Did you order a course change, Spock? ",KIRK
"Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for me to be the one  KIRK: Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan. ",SPOCK
"I make no deals for control of this ship, sir. ",KIRK
Start your readings. ,KIRK
On my way. Scotty. Bones? ,KIRK
Lock onto us. Three beaming up. ,KIRK
There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed. ,KIRK
How do you feel? ,MCCOY
"You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it. ",KIRK

"Open hailing frequencies. Klingon battle cruiser, identify yourself. You are violating Federation space. Identify yourself. Stop firing on scout ship. ",KIRK
Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him. ,KIRK
"You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that! ",MCCOY
"No. To isolate someone like Lucien, that's the same as sentencing him to death. ",KIRK
"Well, those firearms are not necessary. ",MCCOY
"Report, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Well, it was a. Oh, forget it. ",MCCOY
Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals. ,SPOCK

I intend to find out. I'll be in the medical record library. ,MCCOY

Move aside. (he tends to Chekov) ,MCCOY
Absolutely sure. ,MCCOY
"I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them working. ",KIRK
"Bones, what is it? ",KIRK
"You suggest sabotage, Captain? ",SPOCK
"I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor. ",SPOCK
Remarkable. Commander Bem is a colony creature. ,SPOCK

Fascinating. ,SPOCK
"If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave. ",MCCOY
Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one day. The effects are like bubonic plague. ,MCCOY
That's no malfunction. ,KIRK

Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead. ,SPOCK
"Yes, sir. ",SPOCK
"A very interesting game, this poker.",SPOCK

A splendid custom if not carried to extremes. ,MCCOY
Aren't you upset about leaving your parents? ,KIRK
"Doctor, I know what I know. ",SPOCK
"Yes, and where is the captain?",SPOCK

"Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle. ",KIRK
"Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance. ",MCCOY
"An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its co-operation, I can do nothing. ",SPOCK
"Quite correct, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real thing. ",MCCOY
I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong. ,SPOCK

We'll beam down. Alert security. Prepare to transport landing party to surface. We'll land in the vicinity of the distress signals now being received.,KIRK

We'll let the captain handle this. ,SPOCK
"This is the captain. Scotty, report. ",KIRK
No promises. Give me the weapon.,KIRK
"It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are areas I simply cannot scan. ",SPOCK
"Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?",KIRK
"And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why? ",KIRK
"This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.",SPOCK
"Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared just like that.",KIRK
It'll show in twenty four hours. It's a virulent strain. ,MCCOY

"But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak. What do the sensors read? ",MCCOY
I was trying to see the Fuhrer. ,KIRK
Who are you? ,KIRK
I expect the answer is already on its way. ,KIRK
"Easy, Bones. As long as you know there's something down there, you know as much as we do. The rest is only guesses. ",KIRK
"We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your old-style measurements. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm. Explain. ",KIRK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
But does she want to? She's been in there so long. ,KIRK
You're aboard the starship Enterprise. ,KIRK
"Lieutenant. (mutes sound) They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now. ",KIRK
We didn't. ,KIRK
"The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must.",KIRK
"Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain. ",SPOCK
"Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope. ",KIRK
"Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Professor Crater! Professor! Professor! ,KIRK
I agree completely. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
For you and me. But what of Lazarus? What of Lazarus? ,KIRK
These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim's illness. ,MCCOY
Be careful. ,KIRK
"We want the inner one, Ekos. Plot a standard orbit, Mister Chekov, and take us in. ",KIRK
"Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard. ",SPOCK
"Keep it going, Scotty, keep it going. Mister Spock. ",KIRK
We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood cells. What better bait could we have? ,KIRK
But would we have made the error? ,KIRK
Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.,KIRK
"It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past)",SPOCK
A what? ,KIRK
"Nine seconds. Eight, seven. Orbital velocity. ",SPOCK
"Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient. ",KIRK
Perhaps your presence will quiet her. ,MCCOY
"And unfortunately, though the Klingons are brutal and aggressive, they are most efficient. ",KIRK
It has proved effective for Vulcans. ,SPOCK
"Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed out? ",MCCOY
"No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned only a few. I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans, and I have hopes other than death for Odona. ",KIRK
"I know. As much as it might seem at times that I can't stand that pointy-eared encyclopaedia, I don't want to see that happen to him. ",MCCOY
"Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead. ",SPOCK
"All right, young man. We'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off. ",KIRK
Forty eight hours is better than nothing. Gather what you need and beam down here with it. ,KIRK
By drinking the Scalosian water. (and does so) ,SPOCK
Give me Spock. ,KIRK
Why not? ,MCCOY
Deflector shields on. ,KIRK
Take him? Take him where? ,MCCOY
What is it? ,KIRK
"Okay, I admit it's an effective bluff, but so what? As soon as they figure it out, they'll destroy the balloon and us. ",MCCOY
"All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not. You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. From now on, it's going to be under one roof. You're going to run it like a business. That means you're going to make a profit. ",KIRK
 You brought me here to learn this? Does she know? ,KIRK
"But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel? ",KIRK
"None, Captain. ",SPOCK
Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to maintain orbit. We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here. ,KIRK
Anything? ,KIRK
I don't know. ,KIRK
"Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log. We were in an ion storm. Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved. I was in command. The decisions were mine, no one else's. Charges of malice have been raised. There was no malice.",KIRK
"Helmsmen, take us out of here. (Dehner gets hit by an electric charge, then Mitchell) Helmsmen! (Kirk takes controls) Lateral power!",KIRK
I can't just let him stay there. ,KIRK
But we're unhappy here. ,KIRK
"I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her. ",SPOCK
Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on. ,KIRK
"True, Your Excellency. ",SPOCK

"Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours. ",MCCOY
Is Zeon a threat to them? ,SPOCK
Kirk out._ STONE: It's a great pity. The service can't afford to lose men like Lieutenant Commander Finney. ,KIRK
"I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I  KIRK: Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it. ",SPOCK
"Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels  [Bridge]",MCCOY

"Captain, you must get the others away. ",SPOCK

"Spock, here. ",KIRK
That's a fine thing to leave lying around. Show us where it is. ,MCCOY
"Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere.",KIRK
"Now wait a minute. I realise that you can do almost anything a sighted person can do, but you can't pilot a starship. ",MCCOY
"What would account for that, Spock? ",MCCOY

"Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign. ",KIRK
No doubt will remain. ,KIRK
"I think not. Your authority on this ship is extremely limited, Captain. The four of you will remain her in the Brig and in custody until I discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong. ",SPOCK
"Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there. ",KIRK
Did you see them?,KIRK
Have you seen clothes like this before? ,KIRK

"What's your problem, Jim? ",MCCOY
That's a trinary sun. ,KIRK
"I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe  UHURA: Maybe what, Captain? ",KIRK
Deflector shields up. Stand by phasers. (rolls a tribble off his chair) How fat do these things get? ,KIRK
It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus. ,SPOCK
How is the doctor? ,SPOCK
Is there any clue to its location? ,SPOCK
Miramanee. ,KIRK
Must we? ,SPOCK
They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a central projector. ,KIRK
Empty.,SPOCK
"With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research and join you on the bridge. ",SPOCK
"Wouldn't it be something to watch, to be a part of? To see it happen all over again? Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Ahead warp factor one. ",KIRK
Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my crew. Are they dead? ,KIRK
Humans smile with so little provocation. ,SPOCK
Just ahead. ,SPOCK
You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise? ,KIRK
"What do you want, signs pointing the way? ",MCCOY
"(hoarsely) No, I won't. ",SPOCK
"Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life.",SPOCK
Did you know Kara? ,KIRK
"Well, Mister Spock, what have you got? ",KIRK
Captain! ,SPOCK
The auxiliary warp drive controls can only be operated manually. ,KIRK
"You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up. Did you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease, and they became like, Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has.",KIRK
"Stand by, Mister Sulu. ",KIRK
"Analysis, Spock? ",KIRK
Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk. ,KIRK
That's what this whole masquerade was about. To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook. ,KIRK
"I tell you, we should have heard something by now. ",MCCOY
Scotty. ,KIRK
Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally happened.,SPOCK
The price of your survival is too high. ,KIRK
"We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here ourselves. Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward. That might snap us out of the zone. ",KIRK
Bridge here. Report. ,KIRK
Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements. The right boot's too tight. ,MCCOY
"Well, we're still faced with the same problem. ",KIRK
"If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed. ",SPOCK
"I've just picked up my clean uniforms from the service chute and when I put this one on, I discovered this. ",KIRK
"No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. ",SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers. ",SPOCK
There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here? ,KIRK
"Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy. ",SPOCK
"Kollos knows what's in your heart. You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos. ",KIRK
Very good. We'll be right up. ,KIRK
And your door will be closed. ,KIRK
Really. ,SPOCK
Use all ship's energy. Everything channelled to the shields.,SPOCK
"What, Scott? ",KIRK
Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain. ,SPOCK
"Engineering, then ion pod. ",KIRK
"Go ahead, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting.",KIRK
"Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity. ",SPOCK
"I am not, Mister Spock. I was simply trying to stop you from giving us a whole lecture on the subject. Jim, is there anything at all we know about this planet? ",MCCOY
What is it?,KIRK
"Spock, any answers? ",KIRK
"They will be very effective. sir. They've been severely tested, and the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties. ",KIRK
"Yes. Yes, in a way it is. The human brain controls the individual's functions. ",MCCOY
"Spock, you knew? ",KIRK
You can't escape the Enterprise. ,KIRK
The women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us. ,MCCOY
And if that's not it? ,MCCOY
Acknowledged. ,SPOCK
"If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise. ",SPOCK
Why didn't you report it? ,KIRK
How very flattering. ,SPOCK
I wouldn't say that. Mister Spock is a unique personality. ,KIRK
"Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical decisions. And yet two men have died. ",SPOCK
"Commander Bem, I'm afraid that we're not going to be able to rescue you. ",KIRK
"I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes. ",SPOCK
"Well, I do know you made off with a ship that didn't belong to you. ",KIRK
So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect. ,SPOCK
"This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves  AYELBORNE: We have already answered that question. To us, violence is unthinkable. ",KIRK
Let's get out of here. ,KIRK
Like Sulu. If everybody on this planet is like him. Let's go. ,KIRK
Take the risk. ,KIRK
That cat. ,MCCOY
"Yeoman Rand, this is Charles Evans. Show him to his quarters and drop his records off at Doctor McCoy's office, if you will. ",KIRK
"You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening. ",KIRK
Maybe a stronger shot. ,KIRK
Fascinating. ,SPOCK
There are some things in my quarters I want to pack. ,KIRK
"Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to lose her.",KIRK
"What is puzzling you, Captain? ",SPOCK
I can't. ,KIRK
"No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth. ",MCCOY
Spock. ,KIRK
"Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission. ",SPOCK
Let's get the hell out of here.  ,KIRK
A teddy bear? ,MCCOY
We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us. ,KIRK
"Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she obviously prefers you, and you obviously don't seem to mind. If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be left alone to find the power controls of this world. ",KIRK
Jackson! ,KIRK
"We're still on our side, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder, please. Use these co-ordinates. ",KIRK
"Yes, of course. I should've guessed. Congratulations. Tyree, we must talk now. The villagers, their new weapons. I want to hear all about that. We must make plans. ",KIRK
I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. ,SPOCK
Traitors! ,MCCOY
"Photographic section, begin scanning. Tie in to visual section 988-TG, computer bank 22. Kirk out.",KIRK
Launch probe. ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, you are second in command. This will be a dangerous hunt. Either one of us by himself is expendable. Both of us are not. ",KIRK
Kirk here.,KIRK
Materialisation completed. Kirk out. ,KIRK
Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it. ,SPOCK
"If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that. ",KIRK
Ahead full. ,KIRK
Who was?,KIRK
"It was probably just one of the audio tapes rewinding. Come on, there's lots more to see. ",MCCOY
"No. Stand by your phasers, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
You can't wait for the next one. We've had another case like Chekov. ,MCCOY
"Captain, I'm going to fix that woman's arm. They can only kill me once for touching her. ",MCCOY
Fascinating. The result of stress? ,SPOCK
"For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had our disagreements. Maybe they're jokes. I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is  SPOCK: Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief? ",MCCOY
Yes. Spock. I am Spock. ,SPOCK
It's all here. They haven't damaged it. ,MCCOY
"We'll be all right here now, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible. ",KIRK
"Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as he gets, he'll have all that inside him. ",KIRK
Can you do it? ,KIRK
I think you can take the time to lock this up first.,KIRK
Negative. More some type of device.,SPOCK
"You should taste his food. Straw would taste better than his meat, and water a hundred times better than his brandy. Nothing has any taste at all. ",MCCOY
"Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel. Stand by for firing orders. All hands, this is the Captain. We are going into battle. All hands, battle stations. Red alert. I repeat, red alert.",KIRK
"All right, here we are, birds in a gilded cage. The question is, how do we get out of here? ",KIRK
That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people. ,KIRK
"This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim. ",MCCOY
Good. I have questions to ask her. ,SPOCK
It's staying with us. ,KIRK
Correct. ,SPOCK
Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late. ,KIRK
"No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer. And it better be the next one. ",MCCOY
"Clean, fed, in good health, and resting. ",SPOCK
It's dead. It's incredible. ,MCCOY
"Can't it wait, Bones? ",KIRK
I know something about it. ,MCCOY
"Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim. ",MCCOY
Communications status. ,KIRK
Wrong? ,SPOCK
"Apparently, the natural laws of our universe don't operate here, Captain. ",SPOCK
"Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the acetylcholine test. ",MCCOY
"Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.",SPOCK
Nomad was destroyed. ,KIRK
Correct. ,SPOCK
Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us. ,SPOCK
When? ,KIRK
You got Krako on ice? ,KIRK
"Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. ",SPOCK
The walls are not climbable. ,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy, you do not know your good fortune. IF the times were different, you would have to recalibrate for an Andorian. ",SPOCK
Learning to kill. ,MCCOY
Bring the prisoner to the bridge. Deflectors on. Red Alert.,KIRK
The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him. ,KIRK
"Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know. ",MCCOY
Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago. ,MCCOY
Your men are tired.,MCCOY
You again! ,KIRK
"You're taking an awful chance, Jim. ",MCCOY
Yes. You're quite right. ,KIRK
Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. Captain Kirk to the Enterprise. ,KIRK
Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is. ,SPOCK
"Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott._ CHEKOV: And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean they had to. ",KIRK
No award of custody? ,KIRK
"Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov? ",KIRK
I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain. ,SPOCK
"Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed. I do not intend to miss that  [Engineering]",SPOCK
Captain Christopher. ,SPOCK
Mister Sulu! Sulu! ,KIRK
No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon. ,SPOCK
"I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim. ",MCCOY
"Neither do I, but it has. How do I knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn't show any information on Platonius bacteria? All I can do, and this is going to take time, is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope. ",MCCOY
"Yes, say it, Bones. ",KIRK
Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve? ,KIRK
"Scotty, enjoy yourself.",KIRK
It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable. ,SPOCK
The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.,KIRK
Jim? Aurora? What   [Bridge] ,MCCOY
"My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister Boma. ",SPOCK
"If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety.",KIRK
"Mister Arex, prepare for immediate departure from this area. ",KIRK
In six seconds. ,SPOCK

Fifteen seconds. ,SPOCK
"Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere. Sensors read no life forms. ",SPOCK
The attack was thorough. ,SPOCK
"Before you condemn it, why not try it? ",MCCOY
"Report on his weaponry, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
Am I addressing the Ambassador? ,KIRK
"Captain, this symbiont can reproduce itself by mitosis and take over every starship we encounter. It can control computer centres, whole planets. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, speed of those bolts. ",KIRK
Sit down. The crystals certainly aren't here. There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet. Obviously some connection.,KIRK
No. ,MCCOY
"Approximately warp fifteen, Captain. ",SPOCK
Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there. ,KIRK
You see what I mean?,MCCOY
"Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive. If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say nervous. And for another thing, he's avoiding food. I checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days. ",MCCOY
"Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you. So ship out!",KIRK
What happened? ,KIRK
"Aye, sir. ",SPOCK
Doctor McCoy. Captain. ,SPOCK
Then you heard the word of the sun? ,KIRK
"Ma'am, I don't understand. Are you trying to say that she rejected him? That she doesn't want him? ",MCCOY
"If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her.",SPOCK
It's hard to believe that a man could die of loneliness.,MCCOY
"Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger. ",SPOCK
"(with children and communicators) Three hours, eleven minutes left. Thank you, Lieutenant. Keep this channel open. Clear your computers. What happened to him? ",KIRK
No. She said their laws and customs were not binding on you. ,MCCOY
"I am open to suggestions, Doctor. ",SPOCK
But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth. ,SPOCK
Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, my compliments to your repair work and yourself. ",KIRK
"Strange. Yes, I get the same feeling myself. ",KIRK
"No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better. ",SPOCK
"Spock, listen. Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing. He had the right idea but not enough power to do it. Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded? ",KIRK
But why would he want to kill only two of us? ,KIRK
Personal note to the Catullan ambassador. His son is safe. ,KIRK
Origin? ,SPOCK
"It's too late for that, Jamie, but I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened. ",KIRK
Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel. ,SPOCK
"Jim, did you know who that woman was? ",MCCOY
"Thank you, Mister Chekov. ",KIRK
"Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan. ",KIRK
A little dizzy. Otherwise normal. ,KIRK
For the same reasons you excite me. You're a very beautiful woman. ,KIRK
You're discussing tactics. Do you realise what this really comes down to? Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel does. ,MCCOY
Chekov! Stop the torture! ,KIRK
(noticing a plant moving) Jim! ,SPOCK
"Tired. Very tired. You did a fine job, Bones. I think I'll sleep.",KIRK
"I tell you I must! I had two friends with me, who are lost in another time period. I must find them. You'll come back with us. ",KIRK
"They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes. ",SPOCK
No. No. My ship. My ship. ,KIRK
"I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor. ",SPOCK
There were six of you on the mission. ,KIRK
Let me in there. I can help her. ,KIRK
"Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in on it. ",MCCOY
"No, sir. We're being watched. ",SPOCK
No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species. ,SPOCK
"One point one kilometres, sir. ",SPOCK
He was so young. ,KIRK
Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin. ,KIRK
Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect? ,KIRK
"Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you. ",KIRK
"Think positively, Spock. ",KIRK
"It happened twice. First we were in our own transporter chamber, then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here.",KIRK
We've seen the results of some of your tests. ,MCCOY
No problem. Captain to Galileo. All systems cleared for take off.,KIRK
Thank you. ,SPOCK
No thanks is necessary. ,KIRK
"Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.",SPOCK
Which is physically impossible for one man. ,KIRK

Phasers on stun. Fire. (nothing happens) Hand-to-hand. ,KIRK
"Well, I certainly don't want to keep you any longer from your fiancee. Show her in. ",MCCOY
"Apparently our brains are also working in reverse, Captain, so we can now understand her language. That is why the ship seems to be operating in the reverse to us. ",SPOCK
What about the rest of you? ,KIRK
Can we break out of orbit if we have to? ,KIRK
Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays. ,SPOCK
"Our tissues definitely show a massive infection, Jim, but something is immunising us down here, thank heavens, or we'd have been dead hours ago. ",MCCOY
What is that device doing on my ship? ,KIRK

"Sensors just gave us an update reading, Scotty. There's a seaquake due in that area, a bad one. Complete topography changes. ",MCCOY
"We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt. ",SPOCK
"I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are real. ",SPOCK
"In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The gangs nearly took over. ",KIRK
Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus. ,KIRK
"But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years. ",KIRK
May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship? ,MCCOY
Maintain hailing. ,KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in. ,KIRK
How long were we gone? ,SPOCK
What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?,KIRK
"Now let's not jump to conclusions, Bones. Yes, we all got wet, so what's the joke? ",KIRK
"No, Mister Spock. I didn't think you would be.  ",KIRK
"On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit. Fascinating. A remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a glacial age reoccurred. This underground complex was developed for the women. The men remained above, and a male-female schism took place. A fascinating cultural development of a kind which never  MCCOY: I knew it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. ",SPOCK
"I think we've found that answer, Doctor. ",SPOCK
But it hasn't (then it did) Someday I'll learn. ,KIRK
"Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set. ",SPOCK
"The problem, to get in. ",KIRK
"There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing one eight. ",SPOCK
"Scotty, Sulu. Scotty. Put down the phaser. Scotty! ",KIRK
Yes. It's Jim. ,KIRK
Second vessel power supply out. Crew unharmed. They should be able to repair the ship in a few days. ,SPOCK
Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor? ,KIRK
"Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott? ",KIRK
Oh. ,KIRK
"Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up. I don't agree with you, Mister Spock. ",KIRK
Prepare to activate deflectors. ,SPOCK
Cry out and I'll break it. Don't move. ,KIRK
By herself. She took no drug. ,KIRK
No! Does it still taste as sweet? ,KIRK
"I've been packing some things, and I realise there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement.",KIRK
"Mankind, ready to kill. ",SPOCK
"Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov. ",SPOCK
"No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors. ",SPOCK
"We're not leaving orbit, Mister Scott. Not that quickly. ",KIRK
"So far this thing has had its amusing aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny. ",KIRK
"I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why. ",KIRK
"What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here? ",KIRK
The underground complex is shielded by a combination of granite and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate. ,SPOCK
"Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters. ",MCCOY
"Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag so the operator can get into the transporter chamber? ",KIRK
"Yes, Captain. Quite sure. ",SPOCK
"I shall be in my quarters. Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy and Mister Scott meet me there. ",KIRK
"Captain, we're receiving you. ",SPOCK
You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're doing this. ,KIRK
"Bones, you took a medical oath long before you signed aboard my ship. That small patient in there needs you. ",KIRK
"Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that?",KIRK
This little thing? Just something I slipped on. ,KIRK
Alexander. Stand behind me. ,KIRK
I never could talk you into anything. All right. Fire away. ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, prepare to move in on the Romulan vessel. Ship-to-ship, Uhura. Put this on the screen. ",KIRK
"A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees, elevation four degrees. ",SPOCK
"We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice. ",SPOCK
"Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here, and quit explaining why we can't get out of here. ",MCCOY
"You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. You'll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or,  (He starts convulsing, and Janice is doing the same in the brig) ",KIRK
You don't call that damage? ,KIRK
Lars and Chekov's drill thrall. They weren't born here. Where do they come from? ,KIRK
"Mister Sulu, bring us about to a new heading of nine oh two mark six. ",KIRK
"Bones? Bones, answer me. ",KIRK
No proof that Klingons committed it. ,KIRK
"Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship's computers. ",MCCOY
"We're here on a peaceful mission. It's you who have killed our people. We mean no harm to you. We want to leave, peacefully. ",KIRK
"You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth. There are no witches. Why do you deny it? ",KIRK
"Well, Marplon, you're on your own now. I hope you're up to it.",KIRK
Reverse polarity on your magnetic probe. ,SPOCK
"However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging. ",MCCOY
"Pain! Pain! Pain! (he staggers back) That's all I got, Captain.",SPOCK
"We reach, Mister Spock.  ",KIRK
How do they? How do they? ,KIRK
"Is it ego, or something else? ",SPOCK
"Thank you, Lieutenant. Continue the search. Crater, we don't know who or what we're looking for. We need your help, and now. ",KIRK
Kill him! Kill him! ,KIRK
"In the long history of medicine, no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of a play. Riley, don't forget to (but he's not there) ",MCCOY
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit. ,KIRK
"Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a favour or not. ",KIRK
I'm called Spock. ,SPOCK
"You do that. Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area  [Bridge]",KIRK
"We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand? ",KIRK
Vulcan. ,SPOCK
"Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott? ",SPOCK
"Well, I know what a movie is, but. ",MCCOY
"Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together?",SPOCK
I fail to see what they find so amusing. ,SPOCK
"We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots. ",MCCOY
The molecular structure of the brain tissues in the central nervous system are distorting. ,MCCOY
It could happen anytime. ,SPOCK
"No, Captain. I can travel. ",SPOCK
"Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we've been given on this culture. ",SPOCK
"Careful, careful. Shock, radiation burns, internal injuries for certain. He's in a bad way, Captain.",MCCOY
Sound Red Alert. Man battle stations. Stand by main phasers. ,KIRK
Who are they? Where are they from? ,KIRK
"Yes, I'm afraid it's pretty badly damaged. It's hardly worth salvaging right now. I've had our engineering officer, Mister Scott, examine it and make a report. It's here somewhere. He doesn't think there's anything left in your ship except scrap value. ",KIRK
"I can't afford to guess wrong. I've got to choose the right planet, get there, find the brain. Eight hours and thirty five minutes.",KIRK
"I've never used it on a human, Doctor. ",SPOCK
I would assume that. ,SPOCK
The ionised cloud. ,SPOCK
"Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship. That's begging for trouble. ",MCCOY
DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found. Did Spock call in at all? ,MCCOY
"You are at your station, Mister Spock. ",MCCOY
Perhaps you were. ,SPOCK
Chekov! ,KIRK
Were you hurt? ,KIRK
"If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves.",KIRK
"Take it easy, Bones. ",KIRK
What was what? ,KIRK
Let's find out. ,KIRK
"Your modesty is unnecessary, Mrs. April. Your achievements as a pioneer doctor in space are well known. ",KIRK
Of course. ,MCCOY
"I'm with you, Captain. She awed me. ",MCCOY
"Ben, where are you? ",KIRK
"You don't dare take the chance, Captain. ",SPOCK
This is what you have planned for us? ,KIRK
He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by. ,KIRK
You're a police officer. I recognise the traditional accoutrements. ,KIRK
"Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable. ",SPOCK
Your face is wet. ,SPOCK
"Gary. Gary, are you all right? ",KIRK
"I am the Kirk, the creator? ",KIRK
"We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human.",KIRK
You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew. ,KIRK
You've got it. I'll order the wardrobe section to prepare it now.,KIRK
"Her son? We don't have time for children's games right now, Scotty, but beam us down. ",KIRK
Any luck? ,KIRK
One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived with here. (He draws his phaser.) ,KIRK
A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.,SPOCK
"Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise. ",MCCOY
"That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you! ",KIRK
"Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out of your field, Doctor. ",KIRK
With a delayed action fuse. ,SPOCK
"Can do, sweetheart? ",KIRK
He may still need the ship's medical stores. Why prevent contact? ,MCCOY
Good evening. Sleep well. ,KIRK
"It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons. ",KIRK
I should say they've been here and been removed. ,SPOCK
"Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now. ",MCCOY
"Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory. ",SPOCK
"How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier. ",SPOCK
"You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find him. ",MCCOY
"I've done it. (The booth finally blows up.) Come on, let's get out of here. ",KIRK
Did it hurt? ,MCCOY
Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This appears to be an archive or library of some kind. ,SPOCK
You are being led by a man who is insane. ,KIRK
"We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection. ",KIRK
What was he doing? ,KIRK
I would assume so. ,SPOCK
"If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger.",SPOCK
"Well, what happened to that leg? ",MCCOY
"Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz. (breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage. An analysis should prove interesting. ",SPOCK
What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise? ,MCCOY
"Captain, I have completed the analysis of the target area.",SPOCK
It appears so. They do not feel we belong in their zoo. ,SPOCK
You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are.,SPOCK
We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle. ,KIRK
Fascinating. And beautiful. ,SPOCK
"Well, I don't know. Maybe trial  KIRK: Maybe. There's no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know now. ",MCCOY
Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? ,SPOCK
Does he have it? What about the others? ,KIRK
This is Captain Kirk. Inform the ambassador and Doctor Jones we're ready to beam them aboard. Kirk out. Are you sure this visor will work? ,KIRK
It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius. ,KIRK
They must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet. ,MCCOY
I am defending myself! ,MCCOY
Checkmate. ,KIRK
"Yes, I know. That's what worries me. How will my crew react in a world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it.",KIRK
"There are evidences of gram-positive bacteria. It's carried by humanoids without ill effect, but staphylococcus strains don't seem to be native to this planet. It must have been like a plague. ",MCCOY
Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of respiration. ,MCCOY
"Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts. ",SPOCK
"No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked with them. Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence. ",MCCOY
"And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out. ",SPOCK
"No, you won't. You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to work. We'll help you for a while. Humans have survived under worse conditions. It's a matter of evolution. You'll be fine. ",KIRK
It may be just as well. Did you find out anything from the computer? ,KIRK
"Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes. ",SPOCK
"The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. ",SPOCK
Unquestionably. ,SPOCK
What's causing it? ,KIRK
"Missing for six years, and now this junk in space. ",KIRK
"Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in? ",KIRK
"Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed? ",KIRK
How does it work? Show us. ,KIRK
"Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock? ",KIRK
"Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter. ",SPOCK
Then your statement would not be considered valid. ,SPOCK
Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area. ,SPOCK
"No, sir. You did. ",SPOCK
We have two days to find them. ,KIRK
"Alert status. Force shields on maximum. Leslie, begin sensor scan. ",KIRK
"Energise, Scotty. ",KIRK
"I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are you ready? ",SPOCK
"Analysis, Spock. ",KIRK
"Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice. ",MCCOY
"Oh, this seems a lot more friendly than the desert. ",MCCOY
"Mister Kyle, programme fuse for seven minute delay. All non-essential systems on standby. Communications, scanning, conserve every bit of power. We must make it through the membrane before that thing explodes. Make it work, Scotty. ",KIRK
"Have you located the malfunction, Doctor? ",KIRK
"Yes, very well, thank you, Captain. ",SPOCK
(enters turbolift) Bridge.,KIRK
"And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?",KIRK
"Yes, I thought you might. ",KIRK
Strange. It's not on the charts. ,SPOCK
Kirk here. ,KIRK
Here. Here. What's this? ,MCCOY
"The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only the mechanised sentinels. ",SPOCK
"You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the last time you visited Earth? ",KIRK
"There are endless, Mister Chekov. ",SPOCK
He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot. ,MCCOY
"Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know that, Bones. ",KIRK
Are you out of your head? ,MCCOY
"What's happening to you, Spock? ",MCCOY
"Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our tractor beam. ",SPOCK
